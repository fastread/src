Susceptibility breakpoints for amphotericin B and Aspergillus species in an in vitro pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model simulating free-drug concentrations in human serum.,"Although conventional amphotericin B was for many years the drug of choice and remains an important agent against invasive aspergillosis, reliable susceptibility breakpoints are lacking. Three clinical Aspergillus isolates (Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus terreus) were tested in an in vitro pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model simulating the biphasic 24-h time-concentration profile of free amphotericin B concentrations in human serum with free peak concentrations (fCmax) of 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, and 2.4 mg/liter administered once daily. Drug concentrations were measured with a bioassay, and fungal growth was monitored for 72 h with galactomannan production. The fCmax/MIC corresponding to half-maximal activity (P50) was determined for each species, and the percentage of target attainment was calculated for different MICs for the standard (1 mg/kg of body weight) and a lower (0.6-mg/kg) dose of amphotericin B with Monte Carlo simulation analysis. The fCmax/MICs (95% confidence intervals) corresponding to P50 were 0.145 (0.133 to 0.158), 0.371 (0.283 to 0.486), and 0.41 (0.292 to 0.522) for A. fumigatus, A. flavus, and A. terreus, respectively. The median percentages of P50 attainment were ≥88%, 47%, and 0% for A. fumigatus isolates with MICs of ≤0.5, 1, and ≥2 mg/liter, respectively, and ≥81%, 24%, and 0% and ≥75%, 15%, and 0% for A. flavus and A. terreus isolates with MICs of ≤0.25, 0.5, and ≥1 mg/liter, respectively. The lower dose of 0.6 mg/kg would retain efficacy for A. fumigatus, A. flavus, and A. terreus isolates with MICs of ≤0.25, ≤0.125, and ≤0.125 mg/liter, respectively. The susceptibility, intermediate susceptibility, and resistance breakpoints of ≤0.5, 1, and ≥2 mg/liter for A. fumigatus and ≤0.25, 0.5, and ≥1 mg/liter for A. flavus and A. terreus were determined for conventional amphotericin B with a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model simulating free-drug serum concentrations.

The prevalence of antifungal agents administration in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a retrospective study.,"Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are chief infectious complications in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, the diagnosis of fungal infections is difficult, and often empiric treatment initiates. Since there is no data available on the prevalence of antifungal drugs administration in allogeneic HSCT recipients in Iran, we decided to conduct this study.This study was a retrospective review of records of patients who received allogeneic HSCT in the Hematology-Oncology, Bone Marrow Transplantation center at Shariati Hospital in Tehran, between August 2009 and August 2010.Sixty (73.1%) patients consist of 41 men (68.3%) with mean age of 26.3 (± 1.2) years received allogeneic HSCT. Patients received prophylaxis with fulconazole however in 28 patients (46.7%) it was switched to low dose amphotericin B. Fifteen patients (25%) received treatment with antifungal agents. Amphotericin B was the empiric agent administered. In 3 patients treatment was switched to voriconazole. Neither positive culture nor direct microscopic evidence was available from the obtained specimen. Only in one patient the result of serum galactomannan assay was positive. There were no significant differences in neutropenia duration (P value: 0.54), length of hospital stay (P value: 0.27) and number of patients developed graft versus host disease (P value: 0.07) between patients received antifungal agents with those who did not receive treatment.In this study HSCT recipients received antifungal agents for prophylaxis. Twenty five percent of patients received treatment with antifungal agents empirically. Improvement in diagnosis of these infections can be helpful and lead to targeted therapy. We suggest larger prospective trials for better assessment of antifungal agent administration.",2014,24505528,no
Serum and urine Blastomyces antigen concentrations as markers of clinical remission in dogs treated for systemic blastomycosis.,"Serum and urine Blastomyces antigen concentrations can be used to diagnose blastomycosis in dogs.Blastomyces antigen concentrations correlate with clinical remission in dogs during antifungal treatment, and detect disease relapse after treatment discontinuation.21 dogs with newly diagnosed blastomycosis monitored until clinical remission (Treatment Phase), and 27 dogs monitored over 1 year from the time of antifungal discontinuation or until clinical relapse (After Treatment Phase).Prospective study. Dogs were monitored monthly during treatment and every 3 months after treatment discontinuation, with a complete history, physical exam, chest radiographs, and ocular exam. Urine and serum Blastomyces antigen concentrations were measured at each visit using a quantitative enzyme immunoassay.At enrollment in the Treatment Phase, Blastomyces antigen was positive in all 21 urine samples (100% sensitivity 95% CI 85-100%), and in 18 of 20 serum samples (90% sensitivityUrine Blastomyces antigen testing has high sensitivity for active disease at the time of diagnosis and during treatment, and moderate sensitivity but high specificity for clinical relapse. Urine testing should be useful at the time of diagnosis, when treatment discontinuation is being considered, and anytime there is poor clinical response or suspicion of relapse.",2015,24495193,no
Directed modification of the Aspergillus usamii β-mannanase to improve its substrate affinity by in silico design and site-directed mutagenesis.,"β-Mannanases (EC 3.2.1.78) can catalyze the cleavage of internal β-1,4-D-mannosidic linkages of mannan backbones, and they have found applications in food, feed, pulp and paper, oil, pharmaceutical and textile industries. Suitable amino acid substitution can promote access to the substrate-binding groove and maintain the substrate therein, which probably improves the substrate affinity and, thus, increases catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. In this study, to improve the substrate affinity of AuMan5A, a glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 5 β-mannanase from Aspergillus usamii, had its directed modification conducted by in silico design, and followed by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant genes, Auman5A (Y111F) and Auman5A (Y115F), were constructed by megaprimer PCR, respectively. Then, Auman5A and its mutant genes were expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 successfully. The specific activities of purified recombinant β-mannanases (reAuMan5A, reAuMan5A(Y111F) and reAuMan5A(Y115F)) towards locust bean gum were 152.5, 199.6 and 218.9 U mg(-1), respectively. The two mutants were found to be similar to reAuMan5A regarding temperature and pH characteristics. Nevertheless, the K m values of reAuMan5A(Y111F) and reAuMan5A(Y115F), towards guar gum, decreased to 2.95 ± 0.22 and 2.39 ± 0.33 mg ml(-1) from 4.49 ± 0.07 mg ml(-1) of reAuMan5A, which would make reAuMan5A(Y111F) and reAuMan5A(Y115F) promising candidates for industrial processes. Structural analysis showed that the two mutants increased their affinity by decreasing the steric conflicts with those more complicated substrates. The results suggested that subtle conformational modification in the substrate-binding groove could substantially alter the substrate affinity of AuMan5A. This study laid a solid foundation for the directed modification of substrate affinities of β-mannanases and other enzymes. ",2014,24493565,no
Earlier diagnosis of invasive fusariosis with Aspergillus serum galactomannan testing.,"Cross-reactivity of Fusarium species with serum galactomannan antigen (GMI) test has been observed. We sought to evaluate if GMI could help to early diagnose invasive fusariosis and to monitor treatment response. We reviewed the records of all patients with invasive fusariosis between 2008 and 2012 in three Brazilian hospitals. We selected patients who had at least 1 GMI test within 2 days before or after the date of the first clinical manifestation of fusariosis, and analyzed the temporal relationship between the first positive GMI test and the date of the diagnosis of invasive fusariosis, and the kinetics of GMI in relation to patients' response to treatment. We also selected 18 controls to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the test. Among 18 patients, 15 (83%) had at least one positive GMI (median 4, range 1-15). The sensitivity and specificity of was 83% and 67%, respectively. GMI was positive before the diagnosis of invasive fusariosis in 11 of the 15 cases (73%), at a median of 10 days (range 3-39), and after the diagnosis in 4 cases. GMI became negative in 8 of the 15 patients 3 of these 8 patients (37.5%) were alive 90 days after the diagnosis of fusariosis compared with 2 of 7 (29%) who did not normalize GMI (p = 1.0). GMI is frequently positive in invasive fusariosis, and becomes positive before diagnosis in most patients. These findings may have important implications for the choice of antifungal therapy in settings with high prevalence of invasive fusariosis.",2014,24489964,no
[Side effects and contraindications for biological therapy in inflammatory bowel disease].,"TNF-alpha blockers side effects vary according to the frequency and severity and mainly include immunogenicity (ability to cause immune reactions), infections, malignancies, heart failure, demyelinating disease and others. Treatment with TNF-alpha blockers may result in the formation of autoantibodies and, rarely, in the development of a lupus-like syndrome. They should not be administered to patients who have experienced a severe hypersensitivity reaction. Urticaria, dyspnea and hypotension can occur after TNF-alpha inhibitors administration. Serious infusion reactions including anaphylaxis are infrequent. Patients treated with TNF-alpha blockers are at increased risk for developing serious infections (active tuberculosis, including reactivation of latent TB, invasive fungal infections, bacterial, viral, and also infections due to opportunistic pathogens). Therefore, all patients should be screened for systemic or localized infection before starting therapy. Patients with a positive screening for TB should be treated with isoniazid for at least 4 weeks, before starting TNF-alpha blocker therapy. TNF-alpha blockers may be associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma or other cancers especially if combined with other immunosuppressive drugs. Monotherapy showed no such effect in patients, who cited a personal history of malignant disease, therefore caution is needed. TNF-alpha blockers are contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe congestive heart failure (NYHA Class III/IV). TNF-alpha blockers have been associated with reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in patients who are chronic carriers. Patients should be tested for HBV infection before treatment. Patients who test positive should be monitored closely for reactivation of HBV infection during and following termination of therapy. Patients with negative serology should be vaccinated. Severe hepatic reactions, including acute liver failure, jaundice, hepatitis, and cholestasis have been reported. Patients with symptoms or signs of liver dysfunction should be evaluated for evidence of liver injury. Cases of leucopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia have been reported. TNF-alpha blockers have been associated in rare cases with CNS manifestation of systemic vasculitis, new onset or exacerbation of CNS and peripheral demyelinating disorders, including multiple sclerosis and Guillain-Barré syndrome.",2015,24471296,no
Serum galactomannan antigen test for the diagnosis of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis.,"A serum galactomannan (GM) antigen test has been widely used to diagnose invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. However, there are limited data on the use of the serum GM antigen test for the serologic diagnosis of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA).Data were collected from all consecutive patients with a clinical suspicion of CPA who underwent a serum GM antigen test.In total, 334 patients who were suspected to have CPA were eligible for this study and 168 (50%) patients were finally diagnosed with CPA. The serum GM antigen test was positive in 38 (23%) patients with CPA and in 25 (15%) patients without CPA. The sensitivity of the serum GM antigen test was 23% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17-30%), and its specificity was 85% (95% CI, 79-90%), with positive and negative predictive values of 60% (95% CI, 47-72%) and 52% (95% CI, 46-58%), respectively. The accuracy of the test was 54%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.538 (95% CI, 0.496-0.580).The serum GM antigen test could not be used for the serologic diagnosis of CPA.",2014,24462563,no
Aspergillus nidulans cell wall composition and function change in response to hosting several Aspergillus fumigatus UDP-galactopyranose mutase activity mutants.,"Deletion or repression of Aspergillus nidulans ugmA (AnugmA), involved in galactofuranose biosynthesis, impairs growth and increases sensitivity to Caspofungin, a β-1,3-glucan synthesis antagonist. The A. fumigatus UgmA (AfUgmA) crystal structure has been determined. From that study, AfUgmA mutants with altered enzyme activity were transformed into AnugmA▵ to assess their effect on growth and wall composition in A. nidulans. The complemented (AnugmA::wild type AfugmA) strain had wild type phenotype, indicating these genes had functional homology. Consistent with in vitro studies, AfUgmA residues R182 and R327 were important for its function in vivo, with even conservative amino (RK) substitutions producing AnugmA? phenotype strains. Similarly, the conserved AfUgmA loop III histidine (H63) was important for Galf generation: the H63N strain had a partially rescued phenotype compared to AnugmA▵. Collectively, A. nidulans strains that hosted mutated AfUgmA constructs with low enzyme activity showed increased hyphal surface adhesion as assessed by binding fluorescent latex beads. Consistent with previous qPCR results, immunofluorescence and ELISA indicated that AnugmA▵ and AfugmA-mutated A. nidulans strains had increased α-glucan and decreased β-glucan in their cell walls compared to wild type and AfugmA-complemented strains. Like the AnugmA▵ strain, A. nidulans strains containing mutated AfugmA showed increased sensitivity to antifungal drugs, particularly Caspofungin. Reduced β-glucan content was correlated with increased Caspofungin sensitivity. Aspergillus nidulans wall Galf, α-glucan, and β-glucan content was correlated in A. nidulans hyphal walls, suggesting dynamic coordination between cell wall synthesis and cell wall integrity.

Development of IgG antibodies to Exophiala dermatitidis is associated with inflammatory responses in patients with cystic fibrosis.,"The clinical importance of airway colonisation by the fungus Exophiala dermatitidis in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is unclear. We have previously shown that E. dermatitidis frequently colonises the airways of patients with CF. The aims of the present study were to determine whether patients who are colonised by E. dermatitidis have detectable fungal antigens in the circulation, develop anti-fungal antibodies, and show signs of inflammation and impaired respiratory function.We collected sputum and serum samples consecutively from 98 sputum-producing patients with CF aged more than 12 years. The serum samples were subjected to bacterial and fungal culturing and analyses for fungal antigens and inflammatory factors.E. dermatitidis was recovered from 17 (17%) patients, the same isolation rate as for Aspergillus fumigatus. There were no difference regarding the levels of β-glucan in the sera from E. dermatitidis culture-positive and culture-negative patients with CF. Serological analysis revealed significantly higher levels of IgG antibodies to E. dermatitidis cell wall fragments in the E. dermatitidis culture-positive patients. Patients with higher level of E. dermatitidis IgG antibodies were more often colonised with non-tuberculous Mycobacteria, and less often with Staphylococcus aureus. The increased levels of IgG antibodies directed against E. dermatitidis were positively associated with higher white blood cell counts, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, pancreatic insufficiency, intravenous antibiotic treatment, and they were negatively associated with respiratory function (FEV1 % predicted). Overall, 4/17 Exophiala-positive patients were diagnosed as having symptomatic infection with E. dermatitidis and were treated with broad-spectrum azoles.E. dermatitidis triggers antibody production and may cause significant airway infection in patients with cystic fibrosis.",2015,24439251,no
"Success rate and risk factors for failure of empirical antifungal therapy with itraconazole in patients with hematological malignancies: a multicenter, prospective, open-label, observational study in Korea.","We assessed the success rate of empirical antifungal therapy with itraconazole and evaluated risk factors for predicting the failure of empirical antifungal therapy. A multicenter, prospective, observational study was performed in patients with hematological malignancies who had neutropenic fever and received empirical antifungal therapy with itraconazole at 22 centers. A total of 391 patients who had abnormal findings on chest imaging tests (31.0%) or a positive result of enzyme immunoassay for serum galactomannan (17.6%) showed a 56.5% overall success rate.

Hypoallergenicity of various miso pastes manufactured in Japan.,"Miso paste (miso), a fermented soybean food, is popular in Japan and other Asian countries. However, the soybean is known to induce an allergenic response in some individuals. In the present study, we evaluated the allergenicity of various kinds of miso available in Japan. Total proteins were extracted from Amakuti-kome miso, Karakuti-kome miso, Mugi-miso and Mame-miso, and the protein profiles were analyzed. The major protein bands detected in the intact soybean extract were not present in any of the miso samples, which instead showed various low molecular weight protein bands of approximately 10-25 kDa. The existence levels of six major soybean allergens were determined by Western blotting using specific antibodies. We found that the allergen levels varied among miso and allergen types however, allergen levels were consistently lower in miso than in the soybean extract. We obtained similar results for IgE-ELISA experiments using serum IgE from soybean allergy patients. Taken together, these results indicate that compared to soybean extract, various types of miso contain small quantities of intact soybean allergens. Additionally, several lines of evidence indicated that the allergen levels were exceptionally low in the dark-colored Karakuti-kome miso and Mame-miso, which are produced with relatively long fermentation periods, suggesting that the duration of fermentation might be a key factor in the hypoallergenicity of miso.

Differentiation of the emerging human pathogens Trichosporon asahii and Trichosporon asteroides from other pathogenic yeasts and moulds by using species-specific monoclonal antibodies.,"The fungal genus Trichosporon contains emerging opportunistic pathogens of humans, and is the third most commonly isolated non-candidal yeast from humans. Trichosporon asahii and T. asteroides are the most important species causing disseminated disease in immunocompromised patients, while inhalation of T. asahii spores is the most important cause of summer-type hypersensitivity pneumonitis in healthy individuals. Trichosporonosis is misdiagnosed as candidiasis or cryptococcosis due to a lack of awareness and the ambiguity of diagnostic tests for these pathogens. In this study, hybridoma technology was used to produce two murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), CA7 and TH1, for detection and differentiation of Trichosporon from other human pathogenic yeasts and moulds. The MAbs react with extracellular antigens from T. asahii and T. asteroides, but do not recognise other related Trichosporon spp., or unrelated pathogenic yeasts and moulds including Candida, Cryptococcus, Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Scedosporium spp., or the etiologic agents of mucormycosis. Immunofluorescence and Western blotting studies show that MAb CA7, an immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), binds to a major 60 kDa glycoprotein antigen produced on the surface of hyphae, while TH1, an immunoglobulin M (IgM), binds to an antigen produced on the surface of conidia. The MAbs were used in combination with a standard mycological growth medium (Sabouraud Dextrose Agar) to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for differentiation of T. asahii from Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans in single and mixed species cultures. The MAbs represent a major advance in the identification of T. asahii and T. asteroides using standard mycological identification methods. ",2014,24392156,no
Prognostic value of serum galactomannan index in critically ill patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at risk of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.,"Critically ill chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure are at particularly high risk of Aspergillus infection. The serum galactomannan index (GMI) has proven to be one of the prognostic criteria for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in classical immunocompromised patients. However, the prognostic value of serum GMI in critically ill COPD patients needs evaluation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the prognostic value of serum GMI in patients with severe COPD.In this single-center prospective cohort study, serum samples for GMI assay were collected twice a week from the first day of ICU admission to the day of the patients' discharge or death. Patients were divided into two groups according to their clinical outcome on the 28th day of their ICU admission. Univariate analysis and survival analysis were tested in these two groups.One hundred and fifty-three critically ill COPD patients were included and were divided into survival group (106 cases) and non-survival group (47 cases) according to their outcome. Univariate analysis showed that the highest GMI level during the first week after admission (GMI-high 1st week) was statistically different between the two groups. Independent prognostic factors for poor outcome in severe COPD patients were: GMI-high 1st week >0.5 (RR: 4.04, 95% CI: 2.17-7.51) combined with accumulative dosage of corticosteroids >216 mg before the RICU admission (RR: 2.25, 95% CI: 1.11-4.56) and clearance of creatinine (Ccr) ≤ 64.31 ml/min (RR: 2.48, 95% CI: 1.22 ± 5.07).The positive GMI-high 1st week (>0.5) combined with an accumulative dosage of corticosteroids >216 mg before the ICU admission and a low Ccr may predicate a poor outcome of critically ill COPD patients.",2014,24384419,no
Cytoplasmic dynamics of the general nuclear import machinery in apically growing syncytial cells.,"Karyopherins are transporters involved in the bidirectional, selective and active transport of macromolecules through nuclear pores. Importin-β1 is the paradigm of karyopherins and, together with its cargo-adapter importin-α, mediates the general nuclear import pathway. Here we show the existence of different cellular pools of both importin-α and -β1 homologues, KapA and KapB, in the coenocytic ascomycete Aspergillus nidulans. Fluorescence analysis of haploid and diploid strains expressing KapB::GFP and/or KapA::mRFP showed patches of both karyopherins concurrently translocating long distances in apically-growing cells. Anterograde and retrograde movements allowed those patches to reach cell tips and distal regions with an average speed in the range of μm/s. This bidirectional traffic required microtubules as well as kinesin and dynein motors, since it is blocked by benomyl and also by the inactivation of the dynein/dynactin complex through nudA1 or nudK317 mutations. Deletion of Kinesin-3 motor UncA, required for the transport through detyrosinated microtubules, strongly inhibited KapA and KapB movement along hyphae. Overall, this is the first report describing the bidirectional dynamics of the main nuclear import system in coenocytic fungi. A functional link is proposed between two key cellular machines of the filamentous fungal cell: nuclear transport and the tip-growth apparatus. ",2014,24376868,no
Glucoamylase is a major allergen of Schizophyllum commune.,"Schizophyllum commune is one of the causative agents of basidiomycosis including disorders such as allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis, allergic fungal sinusitis, and mucoid impaction of bronchi, the incidence of those of which has been increasing. These mycoses are difficult to diagnose because only a limited number of diagnostic tools are currently available. The biggest problem is that no specific antigens of S. commune have been identified to enable serodiagnosis of the disease.In this study, we attempted to identify a major antigen of S. commune to establish a reliable serodiagnostic method.We used mass spectrometry to identify an antigen that reacted with the serum of a patient with allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis caused by S. commune. The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, highly purified, and the patient sera IgG and IgE titres against the protein were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.The protein identified as a major antigen of S. commune was named Sch c 1 it was a homolog of glucoamylase. The IgG and IgE titres against Sch c 1 in patient sera were significantly higher than those in healthy volunteer sera (P < 0.01).Sch c 1 is recognized by the host immune system of patients as an antigen/allergen. The purified glucoamylase Sch c 1 is a promising candidate antigen for the serodiagnosis of S. commune-induced mycosis.",2014,24372664,no
Proteomic demonstration of the recurrent presence of inter-alpha-inhibitor H4 heavy-chain during aspergillosis induced in an animal model.,"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis remains a matter of great concern in oncology/haematology, intensive care units and organ transplantation departments. Despite the availability of various diagnostic tools with attractive features, new markers of infection are required for better medical care. We therefore looked for potential pulmonary biomarkers of aspergillosis, by carrying out two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis comparing the proteomes of bronchial-alveolar lavage fluids (BALF) from infected rats and from control rats presenting non-specific inflammation, both immunocompromised. A bioinformatic analysis of the 2D-maps revealed significant differences in the abundance of 20 protein spots (ANOVA P-value<0.01 q-value<0.03",2014,24360996,no
PCR as a screening test for invasive aspergillosis in haematological patients: a pilot study.,"Invasive aspergillosis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients, particularly in individuals with haematological malignancy and in haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Nowadays, the galactomannan (GM) assay has been widely used as an indication of invasive aspergillosis, even though the test is known to generate false-positive results. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of GM and real-time PCR (qPCR) to detected Aspergillus in blood samples obtained from high-risk haematological patients. Haematological patients were screened twice weekly with GM testing, which was performed by the Platelia ELISA kit. An additional sample of whole blood (4 ml) was obtained for the purpose of qPCR testing. Sixty-four samples from 12 patients with haematopoietic stem cell transplant or haematological malignancy were studied. The overall accordance between GM and qPCR tests was 96.9 % (62 samples). Only two samples showed contradictory results, with positive GM test and negative real-time PCR results. Based on the high concordance between GM and qPCR in terms of negative results, the main utility of qPCR could be in the confirmation of positive results seen with GM testing.",2014,24309908,no
Efficacy of the combination of voriconazole and caspofungin in experimental pulmonary aspergillosis by different Aspergillus species.,"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, or Aspergillus niger is associated with high mortality. We evaluated the efficacy and compared the therapeutic effect differences of voriconazole (VRC) in combination with caspofungin (CAS) in transiently neutropenic rats infected by A. fumigatus, A. flavus, or A. niger.Treatment groups consisted of VRC (10 mg/kg q12 h) monotherapy, CAS (1 mg/kg/day) monotherapy, combination of VRC (10 mg/kg q12 h) + CAS (1 mg/kg/day), and no drug for 10 consecutive days. The efficacy and the difference in the treatments were evaluated through prolongation of survival, reduction in serum galactomannan levels and residual fungal burden, and histological studies.For all the strains, the combination of VRC and CAS led to significant prolongation in survival (P < 0.05) and reduction in residual fungal burden (P < 0.05) compared with CAS alone, and decrease in serum galactomannan levels (P < 0.05) compared with either agent alone. The survival in the combined therapy groups was significantly improved compared to VRC monotherapy for the strains of A. flavus and A. niger (P < 0.05), but no significant difference for the strains of A. fumigatus (P > 0.05).Combination of VRC and CAS was synergistic in IPA by A. flavus and A. niger, but small efficacy benefits in IPA by A. fumigatus.",2014,24306184,no
Pretransplant Aspergillus colonization of cystic fibrosis patients and the incidence of post-lung transplant invasive aspergillosis.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among patients undergoing lung transplant. Cystic fibrosis-lung transplant recipients (CF-LTRs) may be at greater risk of IA following lung transplantation because of the presence of Aspergillus in their airways before transplantation. This study evaluated the impact of pretransplant Aspergillus colonization on the risk for IA among CF-LTRs.A single-center retrospective cohort study of CF-LTRs was conducted between 2006 and 2010. Respiratory tract cultures before transplantation were reviewed to identify patients with pretransplant Aspergillus colonization. Patients with positive Aspergillus sputum culture or positive bronchoalvelolar lavage (BAL) galactomannan after transplantation were classified as having colonization or disease according to the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation criteria.A total of 93 CF patients underwent lung transplantation. Seventy percent (65/93) of CF-LTRs had pretransplant Aspergillus colonization. Thirty-six patients had positive intraoperative Aspergillus culture from the native lung BAL. Overall, 22.5% (20/93) of CF-LTRs developed IA. Median time to IA was 42 days following transplantation. Positive intraoperative Aspergillus culture (OR 4.36, 95% CI 1.35-14.05, P=0.01) and treatment for acute cellular rejection within 90 days after transplantation (OR 3.53, 95% CI 1.03-12.15, P=0.05) were independent risk factors for IA. Antifungal prophylaxis was administered to 61% (57/93) of CF-LTRs. One-year mortality rate was 16% (15/93). IA was not associated with increased risk of death (OR 2.10, 95% CI 0.62-7.06, P=0.23).Pretransplant Aspergillus colonization is frequent among CF-LTRs and a positive intraoperative Aspergillus culture produced a fourfold higher risk of developing IA.",2014,24305637,no
Galactofuranose-coated gold nanoparticles elicit a pro-inflammatory response in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells and are recognized by DC-SIGN.,"Galactofuranose (Galf) is the five-membered ring form of galactose exclusively found in nonmammalian species, among which several are pathogens. To determine the putative role of this carbohydrate in host-pathogen interactions, we synthesized multivalent gold nanoparticles carrying Galf (Galf-GNPs) and show that they are recognized by the EB-A2 antibody, which is widely used to detect Galf-containing galactomannan in the serum of Aspergillosis patients. We demonstrated that human monocyte-derived dendritic cells bound Galf-GNPs via interaction with the lectin DC-SIGN. Moreover, interaction of dendritic cells with Galf-GNPs resulted in increased expression of several maturation markers on these cells and induced secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α. These data indicate that Galf is able to modulate the innate immune response via dendritic cells. In conclusion, Galf-GNPs are a versatile tool that can be applied in multiple functional studies to gain a better understanding of the role of Galf in host-pathogen interaction. ",2014,24304188,no
Interactions between carboxymethyl konjac glucomannan and soy protein isolate in blended films.,"To elucidate biopolymer interactions between carboxymethyl konjac glucomannan (CMKGM) and soy protein isolate (SPI) in different ratios on physicochemical properties of the blended films, biodegradable CMKGM/SPI films were prepared and characterized. The results showed that CMKGM and SPI are highly compatible in blended film formation, and that Maillard reactions and hydrogen bonds interactions between CMKGM and SPI occurred. The water adsorption of the CMKGM/SPI films progressively decreased with increasing CMKGM level, the surface wettability of the blended films was improved with increasing CMKGM content the CMKGM/SPI blend films had enhanced tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (EAB) compared to pure CMKGM and SPI films",2014,24299758,no
Proven invasive pulmonary mucormycosis successfully treated with amphotericin B and surgery in patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia: a case report.,"Invasive mucormycosis (zygomycosis) is the third most frequent fungal infection in patients with hematologic malignancies. It often results in a fatal outcome mainly due to the difficulty of early diagnosis and its resistance to antimycotics.A 52-year-old Caucasian man was diagnosed with acute myeloblastic leukemia. Following the induction chemotherapy he developed febrile neutropenia. Meropenem (3×1000mg/day) was introduced empirically. A chest computed tomography showed soft-tissue consolidation change in his right upper lobe. A bronchoscopy was performed and the histology indicated invasive pulmonary aspergillosis based on fungal hypha detection. Also, high risk patients are routinely screened for invasive fungal infections using commercially available serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests: galactomannan and mannan (Bio-Rad, France), as well as anti-Aspergillus immunoglobulin G and/or immunoglobulin M and anti-Candida immunoglobulin G and/or immunoglobulin M antibodies (Virion-Serion, Germany). Galactomannan showed low positivity and voriconazole therapy (2×400mg/first day 2×300mg/following days) was implemented. The patient became afebrile and a partial remission of disease was established. After 2 months, the patient developed a fever and a chest multi-slice computed tomography showed soft-tissue mass compressing his upper right bronchus. Voriconazole (2×400mg/first dayInvasive mucormycosis was successfully treated with amphotericin B, surgery and secondary itraconazole prophylaxis. As a rare disease invasive mucormycosis is not well understood by the medical community and therefore an improvement of education about prevention, diagnosis and treatment of invasive mucormycosis is necessary.",2013,24299522,no
Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis.,"Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) is a group of consuming diseases usually presenting with prolonged and relapsing cough, dyspnoea and weight loss. Acute symptoms such as haemoptysis and bronchial or pulmonary haemorrhage may occasionally occur. CPA affects patients with underlying pulmonary conditions, for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or mycobacteriosis or common immunosuppressive conditions such as diabetes. Precise epidemiology is unknown, and while prevalence is considered low the chronic and relapsing nature of the disease challenges the treating physician. Diagnostics largely rely on serologic Aspergillus precipitins and findings on thoracic computed tomography. The latter are manifold comprising cavity formation, pleural involvement and sometimes aspergilloma. Other markers for aspergillosis are less helpful, in part due to the non- or semi-invasive nature of these forms of Aspergillus infection. Various antifungals were shown to be effective in CPA treatment. Azoles are the most frequently applied antifungals in the outpatient setting, but are now compromised by findings of Aspergillus resistance. Long-term prognosis is not fully elucidated and may be driven by the underlying morbidities. Prospective registry-type studies may be suitable to systematically broaden our CPA knowledge base. This article gives an overview of the available literature and proposes a clinical working algorithm for CPA management. ",2014,24299422,no
Efficacy of the combined application of chitosan and Locust Bean Gum with different citrus essential oils to control postharvest spoilage caused by Aspergillus flavus in dates.,"This study reports the efficacy of the combined application of chitosan (CH) and Locust Bean Gum (LBG) in combination with different citrus essential oils (EOs) to inhibit Aspergillus flavus in vitro and on artificially infected dates for a storage period of 12 days. The effect of these treatments on the fruits' sensory characteristics was evaluated to verify the complete absence of off-odours and off-flavours. Bergamot EO was the most effective in reducing mycelial growth, followed by bitter orange EO. Both bergamot and bitter orange oils significantly reduced conidial germination and a complete inhibition was obtained at concentrations higher than 2%. The mixtures based on CH-2% (v/v) bergamot EO or CH-2% (v/v) bitter orange EO proved to be the most effective coatings to reduce conidial germination resulting in an 87-90% inhibition compared with the control. In fruit decay assays coatings based on CH incorporating citrus oils were able to reduce fungal decay in the range of 52-62% at day 12. The study results and the complete absence of off-flavours and off-odours demonstrate the potential of CH coatings carrying citrus EOs at sub-inhibitory concentrations to control postharvest growth of A. flavus in dates.",2014,24291176,no
Antifungal pre-emptive strategy for high-risk neutropenic patients: why the story is still ongoing.,"Neutropenic patients with haematological malignancies are at high risk of invasive fungal disease (IFD). Due to limitations in specific procedures to establish an early diagnosis of IFD, two historical unpowered studies suggested, three decades ago, that giving an empirical antifungal treatment to patients with persistent or recurrent fever under broad-spectrum antibacterials, could reduce the risk of IFD. For cost and toxicity reasons, this strategy became debated when modern imaging and indirect biological markers became available. Different pre-emptive strategies, either based on lung imaging, galactomannan antigenaemia, fungal PCR, or a combination of several parameters, were designed with the goal of restricting the administration of antifungals to the more at-risk patients with early signs of IFD. Almost all pre-emptive studies showed or suggested a reduction of administration and cost of antifungals during neutropenic phases. However, the clinical pertinence and safety of the strategy, and mainly its optimal design, are still pending. This paper reviews the evolution of these strategies and how they may be implemented in the haematology ward.",2015,24283975,no
Laboratory diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis: from diagnosis to prediction of outcome.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA), an infection caused by fungi in the genus Aspergillus, is seen in patients with immunological deficits, particularly acute leukaemia and stem cell transplantation, and has been associated with high rates of mortality in previous years. Diagnosing IA has long been problematic owing to the inability to culture the main causal agent A. fumigatus from blood. Microscopic examination and culture of respiratory tract specimens have lacked sensitivity, and biopsy tissue for histopathological examination is rarely obtainable. Thus, for many years there has been a great interest in nonculture-based techniques such as the detection of galactomannan, β -D-glucan, and DNA by PCR-based methods. Recent meta-analyses suggest that these approaches have broadly similar performance parameters in terms of sensitivity and specificity to diagnose IA. Improvements have been made in our understanding of the limitations of antigen assays and the standardisation of PCR-based DNA detection. Thus, in more recent years, the debate has focussed on how these assays can be incorporated into diagnostic strategies to maximise improvements in outcome whilst limiting unnecessary use of antifungal therapy. Furthermore, there is a current interest in applying these tests to monitor the effectiveness of therapy after diagnosis and predict clinical outcomes. The search for improved markers for the early and sensitive diagnosis of IA continues to be a challenge. ",2013,24278780,no
Overlapping and distinct roles of Aspergillus fumigatus UDP-glucose 4-epimerases in galactose metabolism and the synthesis of galactose-containing cell wall polysaccharides.,"The cell wall of Aspergillus fumigatus contains two galactose-containing polysaccharides, galactomannan and galactosaminogalactan, whose biosynthetic pathways are not well understood. The A. fumigatus genome contains three genes encoding putative UDP-glucose 4-epimerases, uge3, uge4, and uge5. We undertook this study to elucidate the function of these epimerases. We found that uge4 is minimally expressed and is not required for the synthesis of galactose-containing exopolysaccharides or galactose metabolism. Uge5 is the dominant UDP-glucose 4-epimerase in A. fumigatus and is essential for normal growth in galactose-based medium. Uge5 is required for synthesis of the galactofuranose (Galf) component of galactomannan and contributes galactose to the synthesis of galactosaminogalactan. Uge3 can mediate production of both UDP-galactose and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and is required for the production of galactosaminogalactan but not galactomannan. In the absence of Uge5, Uge3 activity is sufficient for growth on galactose and the synthesis of galactosaminogalactan containing lower levels of galactose but not the synthesis of Galf. A double deletion of uge5 and uge3 blocked growth on galactose and synthesis of both Galf and galactosaminogalactan. This study is the first survey of glucose epimerases in A. fumigatus and contributes to our understanding of the role of these enzymes in metabolism and cell wall synthesis. ",2014,24257745,no
Early diagnosis and treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in a patient with cystic fibrosis.,"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a rare and fatal complication in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) who lack concomitant risk factors. The few documented cases in children have all resulted in deaths during hospitalisation. We present the case of a 12-year-old boy with CF who was admitted for an exacerbation which was unresponsive to antibiotic therapy. The findings on imaging raised concerns about a possible fungal infection. As a result, voriconazole therapy was started prior to his respiratory deterioration. He was later found to be β-D glucan and Aspergillus Ag galactomannan positive confirming the suspicion for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Three months after diagnosis, he was discharged home under stable condition. Voriconazole was continued beyond discharge and resulted in improvement of respiratory symptoms. This underscores the importance of early treatment of pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with CF. Unfortunately, the patient died 6 months after diagnosis from a CF exacerbation. ",2014,24248318,no
Blastomyces dermatitidis Yeast Lysate Antigen Combinations: Antibody Detection in Dogs with Blastomycosis.,"The systemic fungal infection, blastomycosis, which infects both humans and animals has presented a diagnostic challenge for clinicians for many years. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic sensitivity of Blastomyces dermatitidis yeast lysate antigens with respect to antibody detection in dogs with blastomycosis. Lysate antigens were prepared from B. dermatitidis isolates T-58 and T-66 (dogs, Tennessee) and WI-R and WI-J (dogs, Wisconsin). Based on results obtained from a preliminary comparative study, five combinations of these isolates and one individual isolate were tested against 92 serum specimens from dogs with culture-proven or histologically-confirmed blastomycosis, using the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Mean absorbance values obtained from the sera ranged from 0.905 with the individual T-58 antigen to 1.760 using an antigen combination (T-58 + T-66 + WI-R). All of the 6 antigenic preparations were able to detect antibody in the serum specimens, but the antigen combinations detected antibody to a higher degree than the individual antigen. This study provides evidence that combinations of the yeast lysate reagents seem to be more efficacious for antibody detection in dog sera, but our laboratory is continuing to evaluate antigen lysate combinations for detection of antibodies in blastomycosis.

Use of fungal proteases and selected sourdough lactic acid bacteria for making wheat bread with an intermediate content of gluten.,"This study was aimed at combining the highest degradation of gluten during wheat flour fermentation with good structural and sensory features of the related bread. As estimated by R5-ELISA, the degree of degradation of immune reactive gluten was ca. 28%. Two-dimensional electrophoresis and RP-FPLC analyses showed marked variations of the protein fractions compared to the untreated flour. The comparison was also extended to in vitro effect of the peptic/tryptic-digests towards K562 and T84 cells. The flour with the intermediate content of gluten (ICG) was used for bread making, and compared to whole gluten (WG) bread. The chemical, structural and sensory features of the ICG bread approached those of the bread made with WG flour. The protein digestibility of the ICG bread was higher than that from WG flour. Also the nutritional quality, as estimated by different indexes, was the highest for ICG bread. ",2014,24230474,no
Tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion presenting with head and neck fibrosclerosing lesions and orbital pseudotumors: a case report.,"Tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion is an idiopathic fibrosclerosing disorder occurring in the head and neck region. It is one of a broad spectrum of entities named inflammatory pseudotumors and, as the name suggests, it mimics a lot of diseases such as malignancies or infections. Combined with its rarity, tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion can be a tremendous diagnostic challenge. This case report describes a case of tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion, which was initially thought to be peri-orbital and mandibular osteomyelitis caused by Aspergillus. A lengthy work up ensued and was required to reach the final diagnosis.A 64-year-old Asian man with a history of diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease who was on hemodialysis presented with worsening exophthalmos and relapsing trismus. He was diagnosed as ""mandibular osteomyelitis"" about 20 years ago. Since then he had suffered chronic relapsing exophthalmos and jaw pain with numerous medical treatments. In 2011 he was diagnosed as peri-orbital and intramandibular aspergillosis because a serum Aspergillus galactomannan assay was positive. He was treated with multiple antifungal medications to no avail. A biopsy of his orbital lesions was not revealing. After repeated biopsies, we finally concluded that the patient was suffering from tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion. Corticosteroid therapy was initiated with prompt response.Tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion is a rare inflammatory benign tumor, which mimics many inflammatory and neoplastic disorders. Conventional work up including biopsy may not lead to the diagnosis without understanding this entity. Awareness of this disorder will aid early diagnosis and treatment.",2013,24229059,no
Safety and efficacy of combined cyclophosphamide and rituximab treatment in recalcitrant childhood lupus.,"To report the safety and efficacy of combined cyclophosphamide and rituximab treatment in Saudi children with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Medical records of all children with SLE treated with cyclophosphamide and rituximab between June 2007 and June 2012 at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, were reviewed for demographic characteristics, age at diagnosis, concomitant treatments, indication of using rituximab and adverse events during the treatment period. Clinical and serologic response parameters included SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), complement, anti-ds DNA antibody and ANA levels, and mean daily corticosteroid dose assessed 3 months before combined cyclophosphamide and rituximab infusion course and at 6-month interval afterward. Sixteen patients (13 girls) with refractory SLE treated with cyclophosphamide and rituximab were included. The mean age at onset of SLE was 7.8 + 3.3 years, while the mean age at diagnosis was 8.1 + 3.4 years the mean disease duration was 4.7 + 3.2 years. All patients were treated with corticosteroid and immunosuppressive drugs. Nephritis (8 patients) was the most frequent indication",2015,24218286,no
Azole-based chemoprophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in paediatric patients with acute leukaemia: an internal audit.,"Children and adolescents with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and recurrent acute leukaemias (RALs) are at high risk of life-threatening invasive fungal infections (IFIs). We analysed implementation, safety and efficacy of a standard operating procedure for oral, azole-based, mould-active antifungal prophylaxis.Patients with AML and RALs aged ≥13 years received 200 mg of posaconazole three times daily and patients aged 2-12 years received 200 mg of voriconazole two times daily from the completion of chemotherapy until haematopoietic recovery. Algorithms for fever or focal findings in all patients with haematological malignancies included blood cultures, high-resolution CT and other appropriate imaging, serial serum galactomannan, invasive diagnostics and pre-emptive therapy with change in class if on antifungal medication.From 2006 to 2010, 40 patients (0.8-17 years 21 males) with newly diagnosed AML (n = 31) or RAL (n = 9) were admitted, of whom 36 received a total of 149 courses of chemotherapy (reasons for exclusion: contraindications and early death ≤3 days). Azole prophylaxis was given in 87.2% (n = 130/149) of episodes. Pre-emptive antifungal therapy for pulmonary infiltrates was initiated in 5/36 (13.9%) patients or 6/130 (4.6%) episodes for a duration of 3-22 days. No proven or probable IFIs occurred. Adverse events (AEs) were common but mostly low grade and reversible. Three courses (2.3%) were discontinued due to AEs. In simultaneously admitted new patients with acute lymphatic leukaemia (ALLAzole-based, mould-active antifungal prophylaxis in high-risk paediatric patients with AML and RALs was satisfactorily implemented, well tolerated and effective. The low rate of IFIs in patients with ALL/lymphoma supports the lack of a general indication for prophylaxis in this population in the presence of a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm.",2015,24198097,no
The COP9 signalosome is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism and of transition metals uptake in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is a highly conserved eukaryotic protein complex which regulates the cullin RING family of ubiquitin ligases and carries out a deneddylase activity that resides in subunit 5 (CSN5). Whereas CSN activity is essential for the development of higher eukaryotes, several unicellular fungi including the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can survive without a functional CSN. Nevertheless, the budding yeast CSN is biochemically active and deletion mutants of each of its subunits exhibit deficiency in cullins deneddylation, although the biological context of this activity is still unknown in this organism. To further characterize CSN function in budding yeast, we present here a transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of a S. cerevisiae strain deleted in the CSN5/RRI1 gene (hereafter referred to as CSN5), coding for the only canonical subunit of the complex. We show that Csn5 is involved in modulation of the genes controlling amino acid and lipid metabolism and especially ergosterol biosynthesis. These alterations in gene expression correlate with the lower ergosterol levels and increased intracellular zinc content which we observed in csn5 null mutant cells. We show that some of these regulatory effects of Csn5, in particular the control of isoprenoid biosynthesis, are conserved through evolution, since similar transcriptomic and/or proteomic effects of csn5 mutation were previously observed in other eukaryotic organisms such as Aspergillus nidulans, Arabidopsis thaliana and Drosophila melanogaster. Our results suggest that the diverged budding yeast CSN is more conserved than was previously thought. ",2014,24164706,no
Triggers for driving treatment of at-risk patients with invasive fungal disease.,"Timing of treatment for invasive fungal disease (IFD) is critical for making appropriate clinical decisions. Historically, many centres have treated at-risk patients prior to disease detection to try to prevent fungal colonization or in response to antibiotic-resistant fever. Many studies have indicated that a diagnostic-driven approach, using radiological tests and biomarkers to guide treatment decisions, may be a more clinically relevant and cost-effective approach. The Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) defined host clinical and mycological criteria for proven, probable and possible classes of IFD, to aid diagnosis. However, some patients at risk of IFD do not meet EORTC/MSG criteria and have been termed Groups B (patients with persistent unexplained febrile neutropenia) and C (patients with non-definitive signs of IFD) in a study by Maertens et al. (Haematologica 2012 97: 325-7). Consequently, we considered the most appropriate triggers (clinical or radiological signs or biomarkers) for treatment of all patient groups, especially the unclassified B and C groups, based on our clinical experience. For Group C patients, additional diagnostic testing is recommended before a decision to treat, including repeat galactomannan tests, radiological scans and analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Triggers for stopping antifungal treatment were considered to include resolution of all clinical signs and symptoms. For Group B patients, it was concluded that better definition of risk factors predisposing patients to fungal infection and the use of more sensitive diagnostic tests are required to aid treatment decisions and improve clinical outcomes.

Human natural killer cells acting as phagocytes against Candida albicans and mounting an inflammatory response that modulates neutrophil antifungal activity.,"Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes with potent cytotoxic activity. Whereas activity of NK cells has been demonstrated against the fungal pathogens Aspergillus fumigatus and Cryptococcus neoformans, little was known about their interaction with Candida albicans.Primary human NK cells were isolated from buffy coats, primed with a cytokine cocktail and used for confrontation assays with C. albicans. Interaction was monitored and quantified using live cell imaging, confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Human NK cells actively recognized C. albicans, resulting in degranulation and secretion of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interferon γ, and tumor necrosis factor α . Uniquely, activation of NK cells was triggered by actin-dependent phagocytosis. Antifungal activity of NK cells against C. albicans could be detected and mainly attributed to secreted perforin. However, NK cells were unable to inhibit filamentation of C. albicans. Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) counteracted the proinflammatory reaction of NK cells by preventing direct contact between NK cells and the fungal pathogen. Activation of PMNs was enhanced in the presence of NK cells, resulting in increased fungicidal activity.Our results show a unique pattern of NK cell interaction with C. albicans, which involves direct proinflammatory activation and modulation of PMN activity. For the first time, phagocytosis of a pathogen is shown to contribute to NK cell activation.",2014,24163416,no
Distinct regulation of Th2 and Th17 responses to allergens by pulmonary antigen presenting cells in vivo.,"Accumulating evidence demonstrates that both Th2 and Th17 responses are involved in the pathogenesis of allergic airway inflammation in animals as well as in humans. The lung contains diverse types of antigen presenting cells. However, the mechanism by which these antigen presenting cells regulate Th2 versus Th17 responses in the lung remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that intranasal administration of fungal protease allergen induced both Th2 and Th17 responses in the lung with different kinetics. Notably, depletion of CD11c(+) cells or macrophages greatly diminished the numbers of allergen-specific Th2 cells in the lung, the infiltration of eosinophils into the airway and airway hyperreactivity. In sharp contrast, depletion of the same antigen presenting cells significantly increased the numbers of allergen-specific Th17 cells in the lung and the infiltration of neutrophils into the airway. Moreover, although a subpopulation of lung epithelial cells express MHC II, lack of MHC II expression in parenchymal cells did not alter pulmonary Th2 and Th17 responses. Our results demonstrate that antigen presenting cells differentially regulate the generation of pulmonary Th2 and Th17 cells in response to intranasal protease allergens. ",2014,24157898,no
Biochemical and immunological analysis of mould skin prick test solution: current status of standardization.,"Sensitization prevalence to moulds reached from less than 10% in the general population to more than 25% in atopic and/or asthmatic subjects. To diagnose IgE-mediated mould sensitization, skin prick test (SPT) and specific IgE (sIgE) measurement are recommended. However, concordance of SPT and sIgE results is often less than 50% and standardization of the extracts is required to achieve reliable test results.The aim of our study was to analyse mould SPT solutions (SPTs) with respect to quantity and quality of protein, antigen and human IgE-binding content as a prerequisite for further in vivo studies.Commercial SPTs of Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus fumigatus, Cladosporium herbarum and Penicillium chrysogenum from six manufacturers as well as two in-house extracts from Aspergillus versicolor were investigated. Protein-, antigen- and IgE-binding contents were quantified by Bradford assay, sandwich ELISA and IgE-ImmunoCAP-inhibition tests. Protein composition and IgE and IgG binding were analysed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, respectively.Median protein concentrations were similar in all mould SPT extracts (90-110 μg/mL). In contrast, antigen contents and IgE-binding capacity showed a high variability with median antigen values from 4 to 118 μg/mL and IgE inhibition results between 30 to 95%. Whereas almost all SPTs of A. alternata and A. versicolor showed complete sIgE inhibition with mean values > 80%, only three extracts for A. fumigatus, two extracts for C. herbarum and none of the tested extracts for P. chrysogenum exceeded 50% sIgE reduction. Quantitative amounts of protein, antigenic and IgE-binding structures were not comparable with the quality of the corresponding protein or immunoblot pattern, with the exception of A. alternata SPTs.Commercially available mould SPT extracts showed high variability raising the question of comparability and reliability of SPT results. Possible consequences for diagnostic test outcome will be investigated in the next step.",2014,24152161,no
SIMIFF study: Italian fungal registry of mold infections in hematological and non-hematological patients.,"We compared the risk factors, the diagnostic tools and the outcome of filamentous fungal infections (FFIs) in hematological patients (HAEs) and non-hematological patients (non-HAEs).Prospective surveillance (2009-2011) of proven and probable FFIs was implemented in 23 Italian hospitals.Out of 232 FFIs, 113 occurred in HAEs and 119 in non-HAEs. The most frequent infection was invasive aspergillosis (76.1 % for HAEs, 56.3 % for non-HAEs), and the localization was principally pulmonary (83.2 % for HAEs, 74.8 % for non-HAEs). Neutropenia was a risk factor for 89.4 % HAEs the main underlying condition was corticosteroid treatment (52.9 %) for non-HAEs. The distribution of proven and probable FFIs was different in the two groups: proven FFIs occurred more frequently in non-HAEs, whereas probable FFIs were correlated with the HAEs. The sensitivity of the galactomannan assay was higher for HAEs than for non-HAEs (95.3 vs. 48.1 %). The overall mortality rate was 44.2 % among the HAEs and 35.3 % among the non-HAEs. The etiology influenced the patient outcomes: mucormycosis was associated with a high mortality rate (57.1 % for HAEs, 77.8 % for non-HAEs).The epidemiological and clinical data for FFIs were not identical in the HAEs and non-HAEs. The differences should be considered to improve the management of FFIs according to the patients' setting.",2014,24150958,no
Invasive fungal infections in lymphoproliferative disorders: a monocentric retrospective experience.,"Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) seem to be a relevant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. We studied retrospectively the epidemiology, clinical manifestations and outcome of invasive fungal infections in 42 patients with lymphoproliferative diseases, treated between January 2004 and February 2012 for probable or proven IFI. In our entire population (1355 patients) of chronic lymphoproliferative malignancies, the incidence of probable/proven IFI was 3% (molds 2.3%, yeasts 0.5%, mixed infections 0.2%). Eight patients developed a yeast infection documented by blood cultures in seven cases and by the microscopic observation of Candida spp. in the vitreum after vitrectomy in one case. Among molds we diagnosed three proven infections by histologic evidence of Aspergillus spp. (n = 2) and Mucor (n = 1) in the lung and 28 probable mycoses. Three mixed infections from both molds and yeasts were also observed. Twenty-two cases showed positivity of galactomannan antigen in the serum (n = 16), in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (n = 4) or in both (n = 2). Cultures were positive in 11 cases. The overall rate of response to therapy was 64%. Fungal-attributable mortality rate was 17%, with a significant difference between molds and yeasts (16% vs. 25%, p = 0.03). At univariate analysis, the only risk factors related to mortality were severe and prolonged neutropenia (p = 0.003) and age (p = 0.03). Among molds, the rapid start of antifungals was probably partially responsible, together with new drugs, for the reduction of mortality, despite the severe immunosuppression of these patients.",2015,24138328,no

Chicken single-chain antibody fused to alkaline phosphatase detects Aspergillus pathogens and their presence in natural samples by direct sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.,"A sensitive and specific analytical method to detect ubiquitous aflatoxigenic Aspergillus pathogens is essential for monitoring and controlling aflatoxins. Four highly reactive chicken single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) against soluble cell wall proteins (SCWPs) from Aspergillus flavus were isolated by phage display. The scFv antibody AfSA4 displayed the highest activity toward both A. flavus and A. parasiticus and specifically recognized a surface target of their cell walls as revealed by immunofluorescence localization. Molecular modeling revealed a unique compact motif on the antibody surface mainly involving L-CDR2 and H-CDR3. As measured by surface plasmon resonance, AfSA4 fused to alkaline phosphatase had a higher binding capability and 6-fold higher affinity compared with AfSA4 alone. Immunoblot analyses showed that the fusion had good binding capacity to SCWP components from the two fungal species. Direct sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with mouse antiaspergillus monoclonal antibody mAb2A8 generated in parallel as a capture antibody revealed that the detection limit of the two fungi was as low as 10(-3) μg/mL, 1000-fold more sensitive than that reported previously (1 μg/mL). The fusion protein was able to detect fungal concentrations below 1 μg/g of maize and peanut grains in both artificially and naturally contaminated samples, with at least 10-fold more sensitivity than that reported (10 μg/g) thus far. Thus, the fusion can be applied in rapid, simple, and specific diagnosis of Aspergillus contamination in field and stored food/feed commodities. ",2014,24128348,no
Hypoxia promotes danger-mediated inflammation via receptor for advanced glycation end products in cystic fibrosis.,"Hypoxia regulates the inflammatory-antiinflammatory balance by the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a versatile sensor of damage-associated molecular patterns. The multiligand nature of RAGE places this receptor in the midst of chronic inflammatory diseases.To characterize the impact of the hypoxia-RAGE pathway on pathogenic airway inflammation preventing effective pathogen clearance in cystic fibrosis (CF) and elucidate the potential role of this danger signal in pathogenesis and therapy of lung inflammation.We used in vivo and in vitro models to study the impact of hypoxia on RAGE expression and activity in human and murine CF, the nature of the RAGE ligand, and the impact of RAGE on lung inflammation and antimicrobial resistance in fungal and bacterial pneumonia.Sustained expression of RAGE and its ligand S100B was observed in murine lung and human epithelial cells and exerted a proximal role in promoting inflammation in murine and human CF, as revealed by functional studies and analysis of the genetic variability of AGER in patients with CF. Both hypoxia and infections contributed to the sustained activation of the S100B-RAGE pathway, being RAGE up-regulated by hypoxia and S100B by infection by Toll-like receptors. Inhibiting the RAGE pathway in vivo with soluble (s) RAGE reduced pathogen load and inflammation in experimental CF, whereas sRAGE production was defective in patients with CF.A causal link between hyperactivation of RAGE and inflammation in CF has been observed, such that targeting pathogenic inflammation alleviated inflammation in CF and measurement of sRAGE levels could be a useful biomarker for RAGE-dependent inflammation in patients with CF.",2014,24127697,no
Consumption of gluten with gluten-degrading enzyme by celiac patients: a pilot-study.,"To assesses the safety and efficacy of Aspergillus niger prolyl endoprotease (AN-PEP) to mitigate the immunogenic effects of gluten in celiac patients.Patients with initial diagnosis of celiac disease as confirmed by positive serology with subtotal or total villous atrophy on duodenal biopsies who adhere to a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) resulting in normalised antibodies and mucosal healing classified as Marsh 0 or I were included. In a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study, patients consumed toast (approximately 7 g/d gluten) with AN-PEP for 2 wk (safety phase). After a 2-wk washout period with adherence of the usual GFD, 14 patients were randomised to gluten intake with either AN-PEP or placebo for 2 wk (efficacy phase). Measurements at baseline included complaints, quality-of-life, serum antibodies, immunophenotyping of T-cells and duodenal mucosa immunohistology. Furthermore, serum and quality of life questionnaires were collected during and after the safety, washout and efficacy phase. Duodenal biopsies were collected after the safety phase and after the efficacy phase. A change in histological evaluation according to the modified Marsh classification was the primary endpoint.In total, 16 adults were enrolled in the study. No serious adverse events occurred during the trial and no patients withdrew during the trial. The mean score for the gastrointestinal subcategory of the celiac disease quality (CDQ) was relatively high throughout the study, indicating that AN-PEP was well tolerated. In the efficacy phase, the CDQ scores of patients consuming gluten with placebo or gluten with AN-PEP did not significantly deteriorate and moreover no differences between the groups were observed. During the efficacy phase, neither the placebo nor the AN-PEP group developed significant antibody titers. The IgA-EM concentrations remained negative in both groups. Two patients were excluded from entering the efficacy phase as their mucosa showed an increase of two Marsh steps after the safety phase, yet with undetectable serum antibodies, while 14 patients were considered histologically stable on gluten with AN-PEP. Also after the efficacy phase, no significant deterioration was observed regarding immunohistological and flow cytometric evaluation in the group consuming placebo compared to the group receiving AN-PEP. Furthermore, IgA-tTG deposit staining increased after 2 wk of gluten compared to baseline in four out of seven patients on placebo. In the seven patients receiving AN-PEP, one patient showed increased and one showed decreased IgA-tTG deposits.AN-PEP appears to be well tolerated. However, the primary endpoint was not met due to lack of clinical deterioration upon placebo, impeding an effect of AN-PEP.",2014,24124328,no
Distinct mechanisms for spiro-carbon formation reveal biosynthetic pathway crosstalk.,"Spirotryprostatins, an indole alkaloid class of nonribosomal peptides isolated from Aspergillus fumigatus, are known for their antimitotic activity in tumor cells. Because spirotryprostatins and many other chemically complex spiro-carbon-bearing natural products exhibit useful biological activities, identifying and understanding the mechanism of spiro-carbon biosynthesis is of great interest. Here we report a detailed study of spiro-ring formation in spirotryprostatins from tryprostatins derived from the fumitremorgin biosynthetic pathway, using reactants and products prepared with engineered yeast and fungal strains. Unexpectedly, FqzB, an FAD-dependent monooxygenase from the unrelated fumiquinazoline biosynthetic pathway, catalyzed spiro-carbon formation in spirotryprostatin A via an epoxidation route. Furthermore, FtmG, a cytochrome P450 from the fumitremorgin biosynthetic pathway, was determined to catalyze the spiro-ring formation in spirotryprostatin B. Our results highlight the versatile role of oxygenating enzymes in the biosynthesis of structurally complex natural products and indicate that cross-talk of different biosynthetic pathways allows product diversification in natural product biosynthesis.

GfsA encodes a novel galactofuranosyltransferase involved in biosynthesis of galactofuranose antigen of O-glycan in Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus fumigatus.,"The cells walls of filamentous fungi in the genus Aspergillus have galactofuranose (Galf)-containing polysaccharides and glycoconjugates, including O-glycans, N-glycans, fungal-type galactomannan and glycosylinositolphosphoceramide, which are important for cell wall integrity. Here, we attempted to identify galactofuranosyltransferases that couple Galf monomers onto other wall components in Aspergillus nidulans. Using reverse-genetic and biochemical approaches, we identified that the AN8677 gene encoded a galactofuranosyltransferase, which we called GfsA, involved in Galf antigen biosynthesis. Disruption of gfsA reduced binding of β-Galf-specific antibody EB-A2 to O-glycosylated WscA protein and galactomannoproteins. The results of an in-vitro Galf antigen synthase assay revealed that GfsA has β1,5- or β1,6-galactofuranosyltransferase activity for O-glycans in glycoproteins, uses UDP-d-Galf as a sugar donor, and requires a divalent manganese cation for activity. GfsA was found to be localized at the Golgi apparatus based on cellular fractionation experiments. ΔgfsA cells exhibited an abnormal morphology characterized by poor hyphal extension, hyphal curvature and limited formation of conidia. Several gfsA orthologues were identified in members of the Pezizomycotina subphylum of Ascomycota, including the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of a fungal β-galactofuranosyltransferase, which was shown to be involved in Galf antigen biosynthesis of O-glycans in the Golgi.",2014,24118544,no
Synthesis of fungal glycolipid asperamide B and investigation of its ability to stimulate natural killer T cells.,"The relationship between mold and asthma has been recognized for decades, but the molecular triggers of asthma generated by molds have not been fully elucidated.

Invasive aspergillosis in intensive care unit patients in Iran.,"We assessed the intensive care unit (ICU) patients for Invasive aspergillosis (IA) with culture and non-culture based diagnostic methods from Iran. Thirty-six ICU patients with underlying predisposing conditions for IA were enrolled in the study. Sixty eight Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were collected by bronchoscope twice a weekly. BAL samples were analyzed by microscopic examination, fungal culture and galactomannan (GM) detection. The Platelia Aspergillus GM EIA was used to quantify GM indices. Samples with a BAL GM index > or = 1 were considered as positive for GM. Patients were classified as having probable or possible IA. Out of 36 suspected patients to IA, 36.1% of cases showed IA which were categorized as: 4 cases of possible IA and 9 of probable IA. 76.2% of BAL samples were positive for GM. From 13 patients with IA, 11 (84.6%) had at least one positive BAL GM index. Of these patients, 9 (81.8%) showed probable IA. The main underlying predisposing conditions were neutropenia (53.8%) and COPD (30.8%). Our study has indicated that COPD must be considered as one of the main predisposing condition for occurrence of aspergillosis in ICU patients. Our data have also revealed that GM detection in BAL samples play a significant role to IA diagnosis.",2014,24069658,no
Invasive aspergillosis in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis.,"Severe alcoholic hepatitis (AH) has a poor short-term prognosis. Although infections are frequent complications of AH, the incidence of invasive aspergillosis (IA) and its impact on outcome remain unknown.We prospectively followed 94 biopsy-proven severe AH episodes for 3 months. We retrospectively reviewed our diagnosis of IA based on EORTC/MSG and AspICU criteria, except for host factors.Fifteen IA (6 proven, 8 probable, and 1 possible) were diagnosed after a median delay of 26 days following diagnosis of AH. The sites of infection were the lungs (n=11) and central nervous system (n=2), while IA was disseminated in 2 cases. Baseline MELD score ≥24 and ICU admission were independent risk factors for IA. Thirteen IA occurred in the context of corticosteroids, and 2 had received no specific treatment for AH. Non-response to corticosteroids at day 7 was not a risk factor for IA, but IA was associated with absence of liver improvement at day 28. Despite antifungal treatment, 3-month transplant-free survival of patients with IA was 0% compared to 53% in those without IA. IA, Lille score ≥0.45, and overt encephalopathy were independent predictors of transplant-free mortality.IA is a frequent complication of severe AH and carries a very high risk of mortality. Systematic screening for IA should be recommended in these patients. Further studies are needed to identify high-risk populations requiring antifungal prophylactic treatment.",2014,24055548,no
"Recent advances in the treatment of life-threatening, invasive fungal infections.","Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) pose significant morbidity and are often life-threatening to many high-risk patients. Timely diagnosis and treatment of these infections with optimal therapy is imperative.Advances have been made in diagnostic biomarkers such as peptide nucleic acid fluorescent in situ hybridization, β-D-glucan and galactomannan, although more research is needed in this area to assist with both diagnosis and monitoring for improvement of IFI management. Novel antifungal agents (azole antifungals and echinocandins) are being investigated that have activity against Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. Optimizing the pharmacodynamics (PD) of our current antifungal therapies through such strategies as continuous infusion of amphotericin B and dose escalation of echinocandins and liposomal formulations of amphotericin B have also been investigated with mixed results. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) shows promise as evident from data with such agents as flucytosine, itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole.The goal for the future of biomarkers in IFIs will be to have excellent sensitivity and specificity to ideally identify a particular fungus causing the infection or eliminate its existence to prevent unnecessary costs, resistance and antifungal usage. In addition, further developments of new antifungals are needed and judicious use of the current regimens needs to be optimized through antifungal PD properties and TDM.",2014,24050675,no
Serum galactomannan assay for diagnosis of probable invasive Aspergillosis in acute leukemia and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a leading cause of mortality in acute leukemia and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).To determine the yield of galactomannan (GM) assay for the diagnosis of probable IA, its temporal relationship with the computed tomography (CT) scans and correlation with mortality in AL and HSCT.Consecutive neutropenic episodes (n=150) among inpatients aged ≥15 years with AL or recipients of HSCT were prospectively evaluated over 1½ years. All patients underwent weekly serum GM assay and optical density index >0.5 for ≥2 samples was defined as positive. IA was diagnosed according to EORTC 2008 guidelines.Of the 150 episodes enrolled, 43 (28.7%) were diagnosed with IA: possible 25 (16.7%), probable 17 (11.3%) and proven 1 (0.7%). The yield of GM assay in diagnosing probable IA was 17/42 (40.5%). In 88.2% of probable IA episodes, GM was positive before high-resolution CT at a median of 10 days (range 1-16). In the episodes with ≥2 samples tested, fatality was higher in those ≥2 values positive for GM, compared to the rest (31% vs. 13.2%, odd ratio 2.96, 95% CI 1.09-8.00 P=0.04).In AL and HSCT, GM assay could identify patients with probable IA earlier than CT chest and also predicted a higher risk of death.",2013,24049291,yes
An investigation on the relationship between the occurrence of CMV DNAemia and the development of invasive aspergillosis in the allogeneic stem cell transplantation setting.,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection might increase the risk of fungal superinfection in allogeneic stem cell transplant patients. The potential association between the occurrence of CMV DNAemia and the development of invasive aspergillosis in this clinical setting was investigated. The current retrospective observational study included 167 patients undergoing T cell-replete allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Virological monitoring of active CMV infection was performed by the pp65 antigenemia assay and/or by a plasma real-time PCR assay. A total of 109 out of 167 patients developed CMV DNAemia. Twenty-three patients had proven (n = 4) or probable (n = 19) invasive aspergillosis. The occurrence of CMV DNAemia was not significantly associated with the subsequent development of invasive aspergillosis (P = 0.38). Overall, the duration of the episodes of active CMV infection and the peak level of CMV DNAemia within the episodes were comparable, irrespective of whether invasive aspergillosis developed subsequently or not (P = 0.99 P = 0.70, respectively). Peak CMV DNA load in patients with proven or probable invasive aspergillosis who died was higher (median, 5,461 copies/ml) than that in those who survived (median 1,179 copies/ml) (P = 0.41). The data argue against the existence of an association between the occurrence of CMV DNAemia and the development of invasive aspergillosis, however, CMV replication, particularly at high levels, might aggravate the prognosis of this disease.",2014,24037906,no
Characterization of specific immune responses to different Aspergillus antigens during the course of invasive Aspergillosis in hematologic patients.,"Several studies in mouse model of invasive aspergillosis (IA) and in healthy donors have shown that different Aspergillus antigens may stimulate different adaptive immune responses. However, the occurrence of Aspergillus-specific T cells have not yet been reported in patients with the disease. In patients with IA, we have investigated during the infection: a) whether and how specific T-cell responses to different Aspergillus antigens occur and develop b) which antigens elicit the highest frequencies of protective immune responses and, c) whether such protective T cells could be expanded ex-vivo. Forty hematologic patients have been studied, including 22 patients with IA and 18 controls. Specific T cells producing IL-10, IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-17A have been characterized through enzyme linked immunospot and cytokine secretion assays on 88 peripheral blood (PB) samples, by using the following recombinant antigens: GEL1p, CRF1p, PEP1p, SOD1p, α1-3glucan, β1-3glucan, galactomannan. Specific T cells were expanded through short term culture. Aspergillus-specific T cells producing non-protective interleukin-10 (IL-10) and protective interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) have been detected to all the antigens only in IA patients. Lower numbers of specific T cells producing IL-4 and IL-17A have also been shown. Protective T cells targeted predominantly Aspergillus cell wall antigens, tended to increase during the IA course and to be associated with a better clinical outcome. Aspergillus-specific T cells could be successfully generated from the PB of 8 out of 8 patients with IA and included cytotoxic subsets able to lyse Aspergillus hyphae. Aspergillus specific T-cell responses contribute to the clearance of the pathogen in immunosuppressed patients with IA and Aspergillus cell wall antigens are those mainly targeted by protective immune responses. Cytotoxic specific T cells can be expanded from immunosuppressed patients even during the infection by using the above mentioned antigens. These findings may be exploited for immunotherapeutic purposes in patients with IA. ",2014,24023936,no
Phylogenetic analysis and substrate specificity of GH2 β-mannosidases from Aspergillus species.,"Phylogenetic analysis of glycoside hydrolase family 2 including Aspergillus sequences and characterised β-mannosidases from other organisms, clusters putative Aspergillus β-mannosidases in two distinct clades (A and B). Aspergillus species have at least one paralog in each of the two clades. It appears that clade A members are extracellular and clade B members intracellular. Substrate specificity analysis of MndA of Aspergillus niger (clade A) and MndB of Aspergillus nidulans (clade B) show that MndB, in contrast to MndA, does not hydrolyse polymeric mannan and has probably evolved to hydrolyse small unbranched β-mannosides like mannobiose. A 3D-model of MndB provides further insight. ",2014,24021641,no
Control of airborne and liquid-borne fungal and pet allergens using microwave irradiation.,"In this study, the dog, cat allergens (Can f 1 and Fel d 1) and fungal allergens (Alt a 1 and Asp f 1) were aerosolized and exposed to the microwave irradiation (2450 MHz) at different output powers for up to 2 min. The allergen bioaerosols were collected by a BioSampler, and analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Control and microwave-irradiated Asp f 1 allergens were also tested with IgEs in human blood sera samples. For airborne Asp f 1 and Alt a 1 allergens, the allergenicity was shown to decrease about 50% when exposed to microwave irradiation at 385 and 119 W and relatively no change at 700 W. For airborne Can f 1 allergen, the allergenicity was shown to increase about 70% when exposed to the irradiation at 385 W, but remained relatively unchanged at 700 and 119 W. In contrast, airborne Fel d 1 allergen was observed to lose allergenicity completely at 700 W, and retained about 40% and 80% at 385 and 119 W, respectively. Radioallergosorbent (RAST) tests showed that changes detected in IgE levels in human blood sera mixtures were not statistically significant for the control and microwave-irradiated waterborne Asp f 1 allergens. This study implies that although certain allergenicity reductions were observed for some allergens in certain cases, particular care should be taken when the microwave irradiation is used to disinfect food, water, and air because of its complex effects.

Comparative evaluation of galactomannan optical density indices and culture results in bronchoscopic specimens obtained from neutropenic and non-neutropenic patients.,"Aspergillus infections are major causes of morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised patients. This study was designed to investigate the galactomannan assay optical density (OD) indices relative to the culture results in bronchoscopic samples obtained from neutropenic and non-neutropenic patients. Galactomannan OD indices from 1427 samples from 2005 to 2012, which were sent from 839 patients and were composed of bronchial lavage (BL = 727) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BAL = 700), were retrospectively analysed. The recovery rates of Aspergillus species from these specimens were 9.4% from the combined patient group and 13.3% from the neutropenic group. Aspergillus fumigatus complex was the most frequently isolated species. The mean and median OD indices of the positive and negative culture samples are approximately 5 and 1, respectively, and 91% of all culture-positive samples have ≥1 OD index value. The receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis demonstrated that the feasibility of the Aspergillus galactomannan assay and Aspergillus galactomannan test has superior accuracy in BAL compared to BL fluids, and the test is not affected by the immune status of the patient. We suggest that the Aspergillus galactomannan test, which uses bronchoscopic material, leads to an earlier diagnosis and if the OD index is found ≥1, fungal growth can be expected.

Pulmonary aspergillosis and aflatoxins in chronic lung diseases.,"Fungal infections of lung have become increasingly common during the last few decades. Aspergillosis and the role of aflatoxins in various chronic lung diseases have not been extensively studied. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples and sera from 40 patients of chronic lung diseases were analyzed for galactomannan antigen (GM) and aflatoxin by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Direct microscopy and culture of BAL samples were also done to detect the Aspergillus species. Results revealed that 15 (37.5 %) of the 40 patients had growth of Aspergillus on BAL culture. Out of these culture-positive cases, 13 (86.7 %) patients were positive for galactomannan antigen also. About 62.5 % cases did not show growth of Aspergillus in BAL culture. However, galactomannan antigen could be detected in 20 % of these patients. Overall, 20 % patients were diagnosed as proven invasive fungal disease (IFD), 32.5 % were of probable IFD, 17.5 % of possible IFD. Aspergillus growth was observed in 100 % of proven and 53.8 % of probable IFD cases. Galactomannan antigen was found in 100 % cases of proven and 76.9 % of probable IFD. Ten (25 %) patients were found to be positive for aflatoxins. It was detected in 6 (40 %) of culture-positive cases. About 62.5 % of the cases with proven IFD and 46.1 % of probable IFD had aflatoxin in their samples. Aflatoxin positivity was found to be more in patients with proven IFD than in probable IFD, and higher level of aflatoxins was detected in cases with proven IFD. Significant difference was observed in aflatoxin positivity among food grain workers when compared to other occupations. ",2014,23948964,no

Reproducibility of positive results for the detection of serum galactomannan by Platelia™ aspergillus EIA.,"Galactomannan (GM) was recently included in consensus guidelines as an indirect mycological criterion for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. Currently, there is an enzyme immunoassay available to detect GM in biological samples, the Platelia™ Aspergillus EIA. In this study, the reproducibility of positive results obtained using this assay was evaluated using serum samples from neutropenic patients.

Depletion of naive T cells using clinical grade magnetic CD45RA beads: a new approach for GVHD prophylaxis.,"Depletion of naive T cells from donor leukapheresis products (LPs) aims at the reduction of alloreactivity, while preserving memory T-cell reactivity (for example, to pathogens). This study established the immunomagnetic depletion procedure under clean room conditions using CD45RA beads and analyzed LPs of six donors for cell composition and functional immune responses. CD45RA depletion resulted in 3.4-4.7 log (median 4.4) reduction of CD45RA(+) T cells, thereby eliminating naive and late effector T cells. B cells were also completely removed, whereas significant proportions of NK cells, monocytes and granulocytes persisted. CD45RA-depleted LPs contained effector and central memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells that showed sustained IFN-γ secretion to CMV, EBV, Aspergillus and Candida Ags. Alloreactivity was measured in MLRs between donors with complete HLA-mismatch. Alloreactive CD8(+) T cells were strongly reduced (median >1-log) upon CD45RA depletion, whereas alloreactive CD4(+) T cells persisted in significant numbers. In conclusion, clinical grade depletion of CD45RA(+) naive T cells from donor LPs is feasible and highly efficient. The depleted products show sustained CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell reactivity to pathogens and effectively reduced CD8-mediated alloreactivity. Prophylactic and preemptive infusions after allogeneic SCT may improve T-cell reconstitution and pathogen-specific immunosurveillance, along with lower risk of inducing GVHD. ",2014,23933765,no
Invasive fungal infections: biomarkers and molecular approaches to diagnosis.,"The biomarkers galactomannan and 1,3-β-d-glucan have been well studied over the past years and are gaining a role in the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections.

Dectin-2 is predominately macrophage restricted and exhibits conspicuous expression during Aspergillus fumigatus invasion in human lung.,"We investigated the features of Dectin-2 expression both at transcriptional and translational levels during Aspergillus fumigatus infection in human lung. Simultaneously, the expression of CD206 was assayed as an activated marker of alveolar macrophages. The characteristic of Dectin-2 expression were then confirmed in Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) after A. fumigatus stimulation by Flow Cytometry. We found that the expression of Dectin-2 was low in normal lung, while it revealed a markedly up-regulation during A. fumigatus invasion. Dectin-2 expression was predominantly restricted to CD206 positive cells. There was salient positive correlation between Dectin-2 expression and CD206. We conclude that Dectin-2 expression is largely restricted to alveolar macrophages in human lung. The conspicuous expression of Dectin-2 during A. fumigatus invasion suggests its notable contribution to antifungal defenses in pulmonary aspergillosis. ",2014,23928558,no
Posaconazole treatment in Korea: single-center experience over 5 years.,"Posaconazole is a second-generation triazole with a broad spectrum. However, there is a lack of data to support a significant role for posaconazole in the treatment of invasive fungal infection (IFI), especially in Korea. Until recently, posaconazole was available only through the Korean Orphan Drug Center. This study was designed to review the use of posaconazole at a single-center in Korea.Data from patients who received posaconazole treatment at Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center were retrospectively reviewed between January 2007 and September 2012.A total of 11 cases (3 males and 8 females, median age 52 years) received posaconazole. Five patients were given the drug for mucormycosis, two for invasive aspergillosis, and four for unspecified IFI for which galactomannan (GM) assays were negative. The treatment duration ranged from 4-250 days. Three patients received posaconazole for management refractory IFI, two for intolerance of previous antifungal therapy, and six for long-term maintenance treatment. The overall successful response rate to posaconazole was 55% (six of eleven patients). Five of eleven patients died during the study period. However, only one death was attributed to the progression of IFI. None of the patients discontinued posaconazole therapy due to adverse events.Posaconazole is an attractive oral antifungal agent for salvage treatment of IFI, particularly upon diagnosis of mucormycosis or in cases in which mucormycosis cannot be ruled out due to a negative GM.",2014,23918575,no
C-type lectin receptors Dectin-3 and Dectin-2 form a heterodimeric pattern-recognition receptor for host defense against fungal infection.,"C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) play critical roles as pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) for sensing Candida albicans infection, which can be life-threatening for immunocompromised individuals. Here we have shown that Dectin-3 (also called CLECSF8, MCL, or Clec4d), a previously uncharacterized CLR, recognized α-mannans on the surfaces of C. albicans hyphae and induced NF-κB activation. Mice with either blockade or genetically deleted Dectin-3 were highly susceptible to C. albicans infection. Dectin-3 constantly formed heterodimers with Dectin-2, a well-characterized CLR, for recognizing C. albicans hyphae. Compared to their respective homodimers, Dectin-3 and Dectin-2 heterodimers bound α-mannans more effectively, leading to potent inflammatory responses against fungal infections. Together, our study demonstrates that Dectin-3 forms a heterodimeric PRR with Dectin-2 for sensing fungal infection and suggests that different CLRs may form different hetero- and homodimers, which provide different sensitivity and diversity for host cells to detect various microbial infections.

TRPC3 regulates release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor from human airway smooth muscle.,"Exogenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) enhances Ca(2+) signaling and cell proliferation in human airway smooth muscle (ASM), especially with inflammation. Human ASM also expresses BDNF, raising the potential for autocrine/paracrine effects. The mechanisms by which ASM BDNF secretion occurs are not known. Transient receptor potential channels (TRPCs) regulate a variety of intracellular processes including store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE including in ASM) and secretion of factors such as cytokines. In human ASM, we tested the hypothesis that TRPC3 regulates BDNF secretion. At baseline, intracellular BDNF was present, and BDNF secretion was detectable by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of cell supernatants or by real-time fluorescence imaging of cells transfected with GFP-BDNF vector. Exposure to the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) (20ng/ml, 48h) or a mixture of allergens (ovalbumin, house dust mite, Alternaria, and Aspergillus extracts) significantly enhanced BDNF secretion and increased TRPC3 expression.

Inhibitory effect of citrinin on lipopolisaccharide-induced nitric oxide production by mouse macrophage cells.,"The present study evaluated the immunotoxicity of citrinin (CIT), a mycotoxin produced by several Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Monascus species. Because nitric oxide (NO), a pro-inflammatory mediator, plays an important role in the protection from pathogens, we addressed the effect of CIT on NO production by a mouse macrophage-like cell line RAW264 activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS-induced NO release from RAW264 cells was inhibited by CIT. Moreover, the transcription and expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) by LPS was suppressed by CIT. These results show that CIT suppressed the LPS-induced NO production and iNOS expression, which contribute to the host protection against invading pathogens. This suggests that CIT on LPS-induced NO release may exert adverse effects in macrophages, indicating immunotoxic effects of this toxin. . ",2014,23897301,no
Activation of NF-κB and respiratory burst following Aspergillus fumigatus stimulation of macrophages.,"Dectin-2, a C-type lectin receptor (CLR), plays an essential role in mediating nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation and anti-fungal immunity in response to Candida albicans infection. However, the molecular mechanisms and function of Dectin-2 signaling in response to infection by the pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus have not been characterized. In order to characterize Dectin-2 signaling in response to A. fumigatus infection, activation of Dectin-2 was analyzed at both transcriptional and translational levels. Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) phosphorylation, NF-κB activation and cytokine production downstream of Dectin-2 activation were also investigated. In addition, Dectin-2-Syk function and its ability to mediate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and elimination of A. fumigatus conidia was examined. We demonstrate that Syk is involved in Dectin-2-induced IκBα (inhibitor of kappa B protein) phosphorylation and NF-κB activation following A. fumigatus stimulation in a time dependent manner. Silencing of Dectin-2 and Syk as well as Syk inhibition blocks NF-κB activation and cytokine secretion. Furthermore, the killing of A. fumigatus conidia and ROS production are significantly affected by Dectin-2 or Syk silencing as well as Syk inhibition. Swelling and germination of the fungus followed by hyphae formation and not the resting and heat-inactivated form of A. fumigatus mediate the activation of Dectin-2 signaling. In conclusion, Syk plays an essential role in IκBα kinase phosphorylation, NF-κB activation, and ROS production mediated by Dectin-2 activation in response to A. fumigatus infection.

A. niger was able to produce high levels of active recombinant enzyme (30 mgL(-1)), whose identity was further confirmed by immunodetection using Western blot analysis and N-terminal sequencing. Interestingly, rLac-LPFA exhibited an improved stability at pH (2-9) and organic solvents tested. Furthermore, the percentage of decoloration and biotransformation of synthetic textile dyes, Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) and Acid Red 299 (NY1), was higher than for the native enzyme. Its high production, simple purification, high activity, stability and ability to transform textile dyes make rLac-LPFA a good candidate for industrial applications. ",2014,23884844,no
CaMKII is essential for the proasthmatic effects of oxidation.,"Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to asthma, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms connecting increased ROS with characteristic features of asthma. We show that enhanced oxidative activation of the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (ox-CaMKII) in bronchial epithelium positively correlates with asthma severity and that epithelial ox-CaMKII increases in response to inhaled allergens in patients. We used mouse models of allergic airway disease induced by ovalbumin (OVA) or Aspergillus fumigatus (Asp) and found that bronchial epithelial ox-CaMKII was required to increase a ROS- and picrotoxin-sensitive Cl(-) current (ICl) and MUC5AC expression, upstream events in asthma progression. Allergen challenge increased epithelial ROS by activating NADPH oxidases. Mice lacking functional NADPH oxidases due to knockout of p47 and mice with epithelial-targeted transgenic expression of a CaMKII inhibitory peptide or wild-type mice treated with inhaled KN-93, an experimental small-molecule CaMKII antagonist, were protected against increases in ICl, MUC5AC expression, and airway hyperreactivity to inhaled methacholine. Our findings support the view that CaMKII is a ROS-responsive, pluripotent proasthmatic signal and provide proof-of-concept evidence that CaMKII is a therapeutic target in asthma. ",2014,23884469,no
Unraveling the nanoscale surface properties of chitin synthase mutants of Aspergillus fumigatus and their biological implications.,"Understanding the surface properties of the human opportunistic pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus conidia is essential given the important role they play during the fungal interactions with the human host. Although chitin synthases with myosin motor-like domain (CSM) play a major role in cell wall biosynthesis, the extent to which deletion of the CSM genes alter the surface structural and biophysical-biological properties of conidia is not fully characterized. We used three complementary atomic force microscopy techniques-i.e., structural imaging, chemical force microscopy with hydrophobic tips, and single-molecule force spectroscopy with lectin tips-to gain detailed insights into the nanoscale surface properties (ultrastructure, hydrophobicity) and polysaccharide composition of the wild-type and the chitin synthase mutant (ΔcsmA, ΔcsmB, and ΔcsmA/csmB) conidia of A. fumigatus. Wild-type conidia were covered with a highly hydrophobic layer of rodlet nanostructures. By contrast, the surface of the ΔcsmA mutant was almost completely devoid of rodlets, leading to loss of hydrophobicity and exposure of mannan and chitin polysaccharides. The ΔcsmB and ΔcsmA/csmB mutants showed a different behavior, i.e., the surfaces featured poorly organized rodlet layers, yet with a low hydrophobicity and substantial amounts of exposed mannan and chitin at the surface. As the rodlet layer is important for masking recognition of immunogenic fungal cell wall components by innate immune cells, disappearance of rodlet layers in all three chitin synthase mutant conidia was associated with an activation of human dendritic cells. These nanoscale analyses emphasize the important and distinct roles that the CSMA and CSMB genes play in modulating the surface properties and immune interactions of A. fumigatus and demonstrate the power of atomic force microscopy in fungal genetic studies for assessing the phenotypic characteristics of mutants altered in cell surface organization.",2014,23870253,no
[Pathophysiology and diagnosis of cancer patients with febrile neutropenia].,"Exogenous pyrogens induce several cytokines which activate immune responses, and produce fever. In Japan, febrile neutropenia is defined as having an axillary temperature of>37. 5°C, and neutropenia showing an absolute neutrophil count (ANC)of<500 cells/mL or an ANC that is expected to reduce to<500 cells/mL during the next 48 hours. Signs and symptoms of inflammation are often attenuated or absent in neutropenic patients. Therefore, careful physical examination is required to detect subtle symptoms and signs of infection. As an initial assessment, laboratory tests should include the following: a ) complete blood cell count with differential leukocyte count and platelet count, b ) measurement of serum levels of creatinine, electrolytes, and hepatic transaminase enzymes, c ) serologic assay for fungal infection, and d ) at least 2 sets of blood cultures. Radiographical approaches are also important for detecting the focus of infection. Proper risk classification should be performed using the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer(MASCC)scoring system to distinguish high-risk and low-risk patients with febrile neutropenia.

Detection of invasive aspergillosis in bone marrow transplant recipients using real-time PCR.,"The invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a serious opportunistic infection caused by various species of Aspergillus in immunocompromised individuals. Basically, rapid and early diagnosis prevents IA progression. In this study we performed a Real Time PCR/ Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) for diagnosis of IA in hematologic malignancies and bone marrow transplant recipients.Sixty two patients with hematologic malignancies and marrow transplant recipients were evaluated for IA in Sari and Tehran from 2009 to 2010. The primer and hybridization probe were designed to amplify the specific sequence of 18S rRNA genes using Light Cycler system and FRET. Galactomannan (GM) assay was performed on serums which obtained from selected patients using the Platelia Aspergillus kit.According to the criteria defined by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) for IA, 18 (29%) patients out of 62 patients were stratified into probable and possible groups. The female-to-male ratio was 1:2 the mean age of the patients was 36 years. The most common malignancies in these patients were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (38.9%). The minimum detection limit was 10 conidia (10(1) CFU/ml) equivalents (100 fg) per PCR reaction. GM assay was positive in 20.9% and real-time PCR probe set assay were positive in 17.7% patients who had clinical signs and host factor according to the mentioned criteria.Using the Real-Time PCR/FRET assay in whole blood specimens seems to be a promising method for diagnosis of IA, especially when used in combination with the GM detection test.",2013,23853434,no
Clinical significance of serum hepcidin-25 levels in predicting invasive fungal disease in patients after transplantation.,"Currently, it is important to identify a good biomarker to predict treatment-related complications in patients with transplantation. This study aimed to evaluate the significance of serum hepcidin-25 in predicting invasive fungal disease (IFD) after transplantation.A total of 57 patients who underwent transplantation were included in this study, and their serum samples were obtained and stored at -80°C for analysis. The serum hepcidin-25 were assayed using enzyme-liked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and hypersensitive C reactive protein (hsCRP) and 1,3-beta-D glucan were measured using standard laboratory techniques. These indices were monitored weekly, from one week before transplantation to four weeks after transplantation.The median pretransplant serum hepcidin-25 level was 37.00 ng/mL which was higher than that of healthy volunteers (p < 0.001). Because the higher hepcidin-25 level of the third tertile among the patients was 39.855 ng/mL, we set a cutoff level of 40 ng/mL to divide them into low- and high-hepcidin-25 groups (n = 38 and 19, respectively). The prevalences of the documented infection in the two groups were 2.6% and 26%, respectively (p = 0.019). The high-hepcidin-25 group was monitored after transplantation. The hepcidin-25 level peaked one week after transplantation, followed by gradual decrease. The plasma (1-3)-beta-D-glucan reached the summit two week. The proven of IFD was delayed 10 days on average after hepcidin-25 had arrived summit and 5 days after (1-3)-beta-D-glucan peaked. The pretransplant serum hepcidin-25 level would be a useful indicator for predicting the risk of infection after transplantation and the dynamic changes of hepcidin-25 in patients with high-hepcidin-25 group would help to predict IFD after transplantation.",2013,23852902,no
β-D-glucan testing is important for diagnosis of invasive fungal infections.,"Invasive fungal infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients who receive immunosuppressive therapy, such as solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. Many of the fungi associated with these infections are angioinvasive and are best diagnosed by visualizing the organism in or culturing the organism from deep tissue. However, obtaining such tissue often requires an invasive procedure. Many HSCT recipients are thrombocytopenic, making such procedure too risky because of potential bleeding complications. Additionally, positive blood cultures are rare for patients with angioinvasive fungal infections, making this diagnostic strategy of little value. Undiagnosed fungal infections in these patient populations are a significant cause of mortality. Prophylactic use of antifungal agents, such as the echinocandins, during periods of neutropenia or graft-versus-host disease may prevent some fungal infections but increase the risk for others. Detection of fungal antigens in body fluids, including cryptococcus capsular polysaccharide, histoplasma antigen, galactomannan, and β-d-glucan, is viewed as being clinically useful for at least the presumptive diagnosis of invasive fungal infections. β-d-Glucan is an attractive antigen in that it is found in a broad range of fungal agents, including the commonly encountered agents Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., and Pneumocystis jirovecii. Cross-reactions with certain hemodialysis filters, beta-lactam antimicrobials, and immunoglobulins, which raise concerns about false-positive tests, have also been described. As a result, the use of this testing must be closely monitored. In this point-counterpoint, we have asked Elitza Theel, who directs the Infectious Disease Serology Laboratory at the Mayo Clinic, to address why she believes that this test has value in the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections. We have asked Christopher Doern, Director of Clinical Microbiology at Children's Medical Center of Dallas, why he questions the clinical value of β-d-glucan testing. ",2014,23850953,no
Genetic and structural validation of Aspergillus fumigatus N-acetylphosphoglucosamine mutase as an antifungal target.,"Aspergillus fumigatus is the causative agent of IA (invasive aspergillosis) in immunocompromised patients. It possesses a cell wall composed of chitin, glucan and galactomannan, polymeric carbohydrates synthesized by processive glycosyltransferases from intracellular sugar nucleotide donors. Here we demonstrate that A. fumigatus possesses an active AfAGM1 (A. fumigatus N-acetylphosphoglucosamine mutase), a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of UDP (uridine diphosphate)-GlcNAc (N-acetylglucosamine), the nucleotide sugar donor for chitin synthesis. A conditional agm1 mutant revealed the gene to be essential. Reduced expression of agm1 resulted in retarded cell growth and altered cell wall ultrastructure and composition. The crystal structure of AfAGM1 revealed an amino acid change in the active site compared with the human enzyme, which could be exploitable in the design of selective inhibitors. AfAGM1 inhibitors were discovered by high-throughput screening, inhibiting the enzyme with IC50s in the low μM range. Together, these data provide a platform for the future development of AfAGM1 inhibitors with antifungal activity. ",2014,23844980,no
Uncertain areas in the diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in patients with asthma.,"The prevalence of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in patients with bronchial asthma remains unknown. We evaluated the roles of various laboratory tests in the diagnosis of ABPA, including, skin prick test (SPT) for Aspergillus fumigatus (Af), and serum Af specific IgE and IgG antibody measurement.A total of 50 asthma patients with more than 1000cell/μL of peripheral blood eosinophils were prospectively collected between January 2007 and September 2011. Evaluations using SPT for Af, serum total IgE and specific IgE antibody to Af by CAP system, IgG antibody to Af by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or CAP system were performed according to the essential minimal criteria for the diagnosis of ABPA - asthma, immediate cutaneous reactivity to Af, elevated total IgE, and raised Af specific IgE and IgG.Among 50 patients, three patients (6.0%) were diagnosed as ABPA, of whom each confirmed five items of the essential minimal diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of ABPA. Six patients (12.0%) showed negative responses to Af in SPT, but positive responses in specific IgE by CAP system. Eight patients (16.0%) showed negative responses to IgG to Af by CAP system, but positive responses by enzyme immunoassay (EIA).SPT and serum IgE to Af measurement by CAP system should be performed simultaneously. It is reasonable to set up cut-off values in Af specific IgE/IgG by CAP system for the differentiation of ABPA from Af sensitised asthma patients.",2015,23827645,no
[The retrospective study of serum aspergillus galactomannan (GM) antigen assay in invasive aspergillosis on hematological diseases].,"To explore the relationship between the optical density index of serum aspergillus galactomannan (GM) assay and invasive aspergillosis (IA).From Jan 2008 to Dec 2011, 825 hematological diseases patients with neutrophil count <0.5×10⁹/L⁹ by continuous blood count tests were admitted into our hospital. The optical density index of GM assay was ≥0.5 at least once. Of 825 patients, 247 cases were manifested as fever during hospitalization. The optical density index of GM antigen was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the sensitivity and specificity of optical density ranged in 0.5-1.5.In this study, the sensitivity and specificity of GM assay with continuous twice samples (73% and 93%, respectively) were higher than single sample (66% and 80%, respectively) when optical density index ≥1.0. 69 cases were diagnosed as proven IA with the incidence rate of 8.36%.The cut-off level for serum GM antigen assay should be decided as optical density index in two continuous samples of ≥1.0.",2014,23827105,no
"Epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of fungal respiratory infections in the critically ill patient.","To elaborate practical recommendations based on scientific evidence, when available, or on expert opinions for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of fungal respiratory infections in the critically ill patient, including solid organ transplant recipients.Twelve experts from two scientific societies (The Spanish Society for Chemotherapy and The Spanish Society of Intensive Care and Coronary Units) reviewed in a meeting held in March 2012 epidemiological issues and risk factors as basis for a document about prevention, diagnosis and treatment of respiratory fungal infections caused by Candida spp., Aspergillus spp or Zygomycetes.Despite the frequent isolation of Candida spp. from respiratory tract samples, antifungal treatment is not recommended since pneumonia by this fungal species is exceptional in non-neutropenic patients. In the case of Aspergillus spp., approximately 50% isolates from the ICU represent colonization, and the remaining 50% cases are linked to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), an infection of high mortality. Main risk factors for invasive disease in the ICU are previous treatment with steroids and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Collection of BAL sample is recommended for culture and galactomannan determination. Voriconazole and liposomal amphotericin B have the indication as primary therapy while caspofungin has the indication as salvage therapy. Although there is no solid data supporting scientific evidence, the group of experts recommends combination therapy in the critically ill patient with sepsis or severe respiratory failure. Zygomycetes cause respiratory infection mainly in neutropenic patients, and liposomal amphotericin B is the elective therapy.Presence of fungi in respiratory samples from critically ill patients drives to different diagnostic and clinical management approaches. IPA is the most frequent infection and with high mortality.",2014,23817660,no
"Fungal contamination and determination of fumonisins and aflatoxins in commercial feeds intended for ornamental birds in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.","The purposes of this study were to determine the distribution of total mycobiota, to determine the occurrence of Aspergillus spp., Penicillium spp. and Fusarium spp. and to detect and quantify fumonisin B1 and aflatoxin B1 in birds' feedstuffs. Sixty samples from different commercial feeds were collected. Analysis of the total mycobiota was performed and total fungal counts were expressed as CFU g(-1). The isolation frequency (%) and relative density (%) of fungal genera and species were determined. Mycotoxins determination was carried out using commercial ELISA kits. The 48% of standard, 31% of premium and only 9% of super premium feed samples were found above of recommended limit (1 × 10(4) CFU g(-1)).

Empirical voriconazole therapy for febrile neutropenic patients with hematological disorders: a prospective multicenter trial in Japan.,"An open-label, prospective, multicenter study was conducted between October 2006 and March 2010 to assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous voriconazole (VRCZ) as empirical therapy for antibiotic-refractory febrile neutropenia in Japanese patients with hematological disorders. In addition, to find the patient groups that may benefit from antifungal therapy, the definition of invasive fungal infection proposed by EORTC/MSG (2002) was assessed in this study. Plasma (1-3)-β-D-glucan and Aspergillus PCR in blood were also measured to improve the diagnostic accuracy. A total of 103 patients (median age, 59 years), including 25 undergoing induction chemotherapies and 19 allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplants, were evaluable. Sixty-nine percent of the patients achieved resolution of clinical symptoms and 31% achieved treatment success, defined as fulfilling the previously described five-part composite endpoint. Although VRCZ was discontinued in 9.7% of the patients because of adverse effects, all the patients recovered soon after discontinuation of VRCZ. The treatment success rate of VRCZ appeared to be higher in patients categorized as ""not classified"" compared with ""possible invasive fungal disease"" according to the EORTC/MSG criteria. Moreover, six ""not classified"" patients were positive for either plasma (1-3)-β-D-glucan (n = 5) or Aspergillus PCR in blood (n = 2). The present study demonstrates that empirical VRCZ therapy is safe and effective in Japanese patients. Additionally, (1-3)-β-D-glucan and Aspergillus PCR tests were expected to provide additional information on the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections.",2014,23813092,no
Regional cytokine responses to pulmonary aspergillosis in immunocompetent rats.,"Rat models of pulmonary aspergillosis are used widely in diagnostic studies and in exploring antifungal therapeutic modalities, but there is lack of data concerning antifungal immunity in rats. In this study, cytokine response to pulmonary infection to Aspergillus fumigatus in non-immunosuppressed rats is explored. Temporal display (from the start of infection up to its eradication) of proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ and IL-17) as well as Th2/anti-inflammatory ones (IL-4 and IL-10) was explored by measuring their presence in the environment in which elimination of infection occur (lung homogenates), by production of these mediators by lung cells (recovered by enzyme digestion or by bronchoalveolar lavage) as well as by cells of draining lymph nodes (as sites of generation of cytokine-producing cells). Reduction of infection (1 × 10⁷conidia) was associated with an increase of IFN-γ and IL-17 content in lung homogenates, but with unchanged IL-4 and IL-10 content. Lung cells produced proinflammatory cytokines with differential dynamics (IFN-γ earlier than IL-17). Differential pattern of Th2/anti-inflammatory cytokine production by lung cells was observed (unchanged IL-4 and increased IL-10), with the levels of the latter higher than proinflammatory cytokines. Upregulation of IFN-γ, IL-17 and IL-10 production and gene expression, but downregulation of IL-4, by draining lymph node cells (dLN cells) accounted essentially for the observed ex vivo cytokine response in lungs. Similar pattern of cytokine production by dLN cells following restimulation with A. fumigatus conidia confirmed the specificity of cytokine response to the fungus. Draining lymph node CD4⁺ cells seems to be the main source of proinflammatory cytokines, significant contributors to IL-10 production and the target for down regulation of IL-4. The knowledge of immune-based mechanisms of defense against A. fumigatus in rats might be helpful in the future use of rat models of pulmonary aspergillosis particularly those that develop immune-based therapeutic interventions as an adjunct treatment of fungal diseases.",2014,23810257,no
IL-33-responsive innate lymphoid cells are an important source of IL-13 in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.,"Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) and CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) are associated with Th1 and Th2 cytokine polarization, respectively however, the pathophysiology of CRS remains unclear. The importance of innate lymphoid cells in Th2-mediated inflammatory disease has not been clearly defined.The objective of this study was to investigate the role of the epithelial cell-derived cytokine IL-33 and IL-33-responsive innate lymphoid cells in the pathophysiology of CRS.Relative gene expression was evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Innate lymphoid cells in inflamed ethmoid sinus mucosa from patients with CRSsNP and CRSwNP were characterized using flow cytometry. Cytokine production from lymphoid cells isolated from inflamed mucosa of patients with CRS was examined using ELISA and intracellular cytokine staining.Elevated expression of ST2, the ligand-binding chain of the IL-33 receptor, was observed in inflamed sinonasal mucosa from CRSwNP compared with CRSsNP and healthy control subjects. An increased percentage of innate lymphoid cells was observed in inflamed sinonasal mucosa from CRSwNP compared with CRSsNP. ST2(+) innate lymphoid cells are a consistent source of IL-13 in response to IL-33 stimulation. Significant induction of IL-33 was observed in epithelial cells derived from patients with CRSwNP compared with patients with CRSsNP in response to stimulation with Aspergillus fumigatus extract.These data suggest a role for sinonasal epithelial cell-derived IL-33 and an IL-33-responsive innate lymphoid cell population in the pathophysiology of CRSwNP demonstrating the functional importance of innate lymphoid cells in Th2-mediated inflammatory disease.",2014,23805875,no
Utility of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid galactomannan alone or in combination with PCR for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in adult hematology patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The clinical utility of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid galactomannan (GM) for the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) varies widely across studies mainly due to heterogeneity of the studied populations.We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 16 studies involving 783 adults with hematological malignancies to derive summary estimates of the overall accuracy of BAL-GM for diagnosing IA.Summary estimates of BAL-GM using an optical density (OD) index cutoff value of 1.5 for proven and probable IA were: sensitivity 0.92 (95% CI = 0.48-0.99), specificity 0.98 (95% CI = 0.78-1.00), positive likelihood ratio 53.7 (95% CI = 3.7-771.8), and negative likelihood ratio 0.08 (95% CI = 0.01-0.83). Comparing serum GM and Aspergillus PCR testing on BAL fluid, BAL-GM conferred greater sensitivity, but lower specificity than the serum GM test, and similar specificity as the PCR assay. The use of BAL-GM with serum GM or BAL-PCR tests increased the sensitivity moderately when a positive result was defined by either assay.GM quantification in BAL fluid at an OD index cutoff value of 1.5 has excellent sensitivity and specificity to assist clinical decision-making in confirming or excluding a diagnosis of IA when results are interpreted with clinical findings. Additional research investigating the effects of antifungal agents, optimal timing and processing of BAL sampling are needed to improve the diagnostic accuracy of BAL-GM testing.",2015,23799871,no
"Performance of serum biomarkers for the early detection of invasive aspergillosis in febrile, neutropenic patients: a multi-state model.","The performance of serum biomarkers for the early detection of invasive aspergillosis expectedly depends on the timing of test results relative to the empirical administration of antifungal therapy during neutropenia, although a dynamic evaluation framework is lacking.We developed a multi-state model describing simultaneously the likelihood of empirical antifungal therapy and the risk of invasive aspergillosis during neutropenia. We evaluated whether the first positive test result with a biomarker is an independent predictor of invasive aspergillosis when both diagnostic information used to treat and risk factors of developing invasive aspergillosis are taken into account over time. We applied the multi-state model to a homogeneous cohort of 185 high-risk patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Patients were prospectively screened for galactomannan antigenemia twice a week for immediate treatment decision 2,214 serum samples were collected on the same days and blindly assessed for (1->3)- β-D-glucan antigenemia and a quantitative PCR assay targeting a mitochondrial locus.The usual evaluation framework of biomarker performance was unable to distinguish clinical benefits of β-glucan or PCR assays. The multi-state model evidenced that the risk of invasive aspergillosis is a complex time function of neutropenia duration and risk management. The quantitative PCR assay accelerated the early detection of invasive aspergillosis (P = .010), independently of other diagnostic information used to treat, while β-glucan assay did not (P = .53).The performance of serum biomarkers for the early detection of invasive aspergillosis is better apprehended by the evaluation of time-varying predictors in a multi-state model. Our results provide strong rationale for prospective studies testing a preemptive antifungal therapy, guided by clinical, radiological, and bi-weekly blood screening with galactomannan antigenemia and a standardized quantitative PCR assay.",2014,23799048,no
Significant decline in Galactomannan Signal during storage of clinical serum samples.,"Galactomannan (GM) is widely used for detection of invasive aspergillosis in high-risk haemato-oncology patients.

"Reference values for hematology, plasma biochemical analysis, plasma protein electrophoresis, and Aspergillus serology in elegant-crested tinamou (Eudromia elegans).","Elegant-crested tinamou (Eudromia elegans) are members of the family Tinamidae. A review of postmortem records at the Saint Louis Zoo suggests that this species is highly susceptible to aspergillosis. Antemortem detection of Aspergillus infections can be aided by evaluating results of hematologic, plasma biochemical, protein electrophoretic, and Aspergillus antigen and antibody serologic testing. To establish species-specific reference intervals for these parameters in elegant-crested tinamou, blood samples were collected and analyzed from 19 healthy captive adult and subadult elegant-crested tinamou. The predominant circulating leukocyte in elegant-crested tinamou is the lymphocyte. Prealbumin electrophoresis fractions were detected in 4 of 19 birds (21%), and globulin fractions were detected in all birds.

The serum galactomannan index predicts mortality in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with invasive aspergillosis.,"We examined the relationship between serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) galactomannan index (GMI) values and mortality in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Using a clinical sign and symptom-initiated approach, we found that the serum but not the BAL GMI level correlated with 42- and 180-day patient mortality.",2014,23759343,no
Cytokine and transcription factor expression by Aspergillus fumigatus-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells in dogs with sino-nasal aspergillosis.,"The causal agent of sino-nasal aspergillosis is usually Aspergillus fumigatus, which is a saprophytic and ubiquitous fungus that causes a severe rhinosinusitis in apparent healthy dogs. Affected dogs do not have systemic immuno-suppression. It has been shown previously that dogs affected by this disease have local over-expression of interleukin (IL)-10 and Th1 cytokines in nasal mucosal tissue. The aim of the present study was to assess the response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from affected and unaffected dogs to antigen-specific stimulation with heat-inactivated Aspergillus spp. conidia, by quantifying gene expression for specific Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg cytokines and their related transcription factors. Quantification of IL-4 and IFN-γ protein in culture supernatant was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). PBMC from dogs with SNA produced adequate mRNA encoding IFN-γ and IFN-γ protein. The expression of IL-17A mRNA was significantly greater in PBMC of affected compared with unaffected dogs. The amount of IL-10 mRNA in PBMC from affected dogs decreased after antigen-specific challenge. These results suggest that the incapacity of affected dogs to clear these fungal infections is not related to a defect in Th1 immunity or to an overwhelming regulatory reaction, but rather to an uncontrolled pro-inflammatory reaction driven by Th17 cells.",2014,23759303,no
Efficacy and safety of micafungin for prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in patients undergoing haplo-identical hematopoietic SCT.,"Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) such as candidiasis and mold infections have caused significant morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised patients in recent years. Micafungin, a new echinocandin, inhibits fungal cell wall β-glucan synthesis, with potent activity against most species of Candida and Aspergillus. The aim of this observational study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of micafungin in prophylaxis of IFIs in 26 high-risk adult patients with various hematological diseases receiving haplo-identical Allo-SCT. Only two patients had a history of possible aspergillosis before transplant treated by voriconazole. The patients received a median of four lines (2-7) of treatment before Allo-SCT. Thirteen patients (50%) received at least one prior Auto-SCT and eight patients (31%) received a previous Allo-SCT. Patients received a median of 29 infusions (range, 15-85) of micafungin (50 mg/day i.v. as a 1-h infusion). The treatment was initiated at the beginning of the transplant conditioning regimen until the hospital discharge. None of our patients discontinued the treatment for drug-related adverse events. Micafungin was not associated with any hepatotoxicity. Only one patient (4%) discontinued the treatment because of early disease progression. In all patients no Candida and/or Aspergillus species was documented after 3 and 6 months from transplant. None of our patients presented a positive galactomannan antigenemia >0.5. Nine patients (35%) presented a CMV reactivation. Four patients presented an acute GVHD grade II and two patients presented a chronic GVHD. The median follow-up was 11 months (3-23). At the last follow-up, there were 20 patients (77%) who were alive",2014,23749104,no
Variability in Galactomannan detection by Platelia Aspergillus EIA™ according to the Aspergillus species.,"Here we investigate the extent to which different Aspergillus species release galactomannan (GM) in vitro.

The in vivo significance of these findings remains to be determined.",2013,23740016,no
Structural requirements for sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) cleavage in fission yeast.,"Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are central regulators of cellular lipid synthesis and homeostasis. Mammalian SREBPs are proteolytically activated and liberated from the membrane by Golgi Site-1 and Site-2 proteases. Fission yeast SREBPs, Sre1 and Sre2, employ a different mechanism that genetically requires the Golgi Dsc E3 ligase complex for cleavage activation. Here, we established Sre2 as a model to define structural requirements for SREBP cleavage. We showed that Sre2 cleavage does not require the N-terminal basic helix-loop-helix zipper transcription factor domain, thus separating cleavage of Sre2 from its transcription factor function. From a mutagenesis screen of 94 C-terminal residues of Sre2, we isolated 15 residues required for cleavage and further identified a glycine-leucine sequence required for Sre2 cleavage. Importantly, the glycine-leucine sequence is located at a conserved distance before the first transmembrane segment of both Sre1 and Sre2 and cleavage occurs in between this sequence and the membrane. Bioinformatic analysis revealed a broad conservation of this novel glycine-leucine motif in SREBP homologs of ascomycete fungi, including the opportunistic human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus where SREBP is required for virulence. Consistent with this, the sequence was also required for cleavage of the oxygen-responsive transcription factor Sre1 and adaptation to hypoxia, demonstrating functional conservation of this cleavage recognition motif. These cleavage mutants will aid identification of the fungal SREBP protease and facilitate functional dissection of the Dsc E3 ligase required for SREBP activation and fungal pathogenesis.

Novel immunologic classification of aspergillosis in adult cystic fibrosis.,"Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) demonstrate a wide range of hypersensitivity responses to Aspergillus, beyond allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, which require classification.This study integrated 2 new methods of Aspergillus detection-sputum galactomannan (GM) and real-time PCR-alongside established serologic markers, to reclassify aspergillosis in CF.A total of 146 adult patients with CF had serologic tests (ImmunoCap total IgE, specific Aspergillus fumigatus IgE, and specific A fumigatus IgG), sputum real-time Aspergillus PCR, and sputum GM. Patients were classified by using latent class analysis.Both RT-PCR and GM were more sensitive than culture in detecting Aspergillus in sputum (culture 37%, RT-PCR 74%, and GM 46%). Intraassay and interassay reproducibility of PCR and GM was excellent. Latent class analysis of triazole-naive patients identified a nondiseased group and 3 disease classes: class 1 (n = 49, 37.7%) represented patients with or without positive RT-PCR but no immunologic response to A fumigatus and negative GM (nondiseased) class 2 (n = 23, 17.7%) represented patients with positive RT-PCR, elevated total and specific A fumigatus IgE/IgG, and positive GM (serologic allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis)Three distinct classes of aspergillosis in CF were identified by latent class analysis by using serologic, RT-PCR, and GM data. This novel classification will facilitate improved phenotyping, pathogenesis studies, and management evaluations.",2013,23726262,no
Diagnostic value of immunoglobulin G antibodies against Candida enolase and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase for candidemia.,"The yeast Candida is one of the most frequent pathogens isolated from bloodstream infections and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Problems with clinical and microbiological diagnosis of invasive candidiasis (IC) have prompted the development of non-culture-based laboratory methods. Previous reports suggest that serological detection of antibodies might be useful for diagnosing systemic candidiasis.Diagnosis of IC using antibodies against recombinant Candida albicans enolase (Eno) and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (Fba1) was evaluated. Using recombinant Eno and Fba1 as coating antigens, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used to analyze sera from patients with candidemia (n = 101), Candida colonization (n = 50), bacteremia (n = 84), invasive aspergillosis (n = 40) and from healthy controls (n = 200).The results demonstrated that ELISA detection of anti-Eno and anti-Fba1 IgG distinguished IC from other pathogenic infections in patients and healthy individuals. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 72.3%, 94.7%, 78.5% and 93% for anti-Eno, and 87.1%, 92.8%, 76.5% and 96.4% for anti-Fba1 antibodies, respectively. Combining these two tests improved sensitivity up to 90.1% and negative predictive value up to 97.1%, with specificity and positive predictive values of 90.6% and 72.2%. The tests were specific to the Candida genus and antibody titers were higher for candidemia patients than for controls. Positive antibody tests were obtained before blood culture results for 42.2% of patients for anti-Eno and 51.1% for anti-Fba1.These data suggest that tests that detect IgG antibodies against Candida enolase and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, especially when used in combination, could be a powerful tool for diagnosing IC.",2014,23725337,no
"Fungal sepsis in the ICU: are we doing better? Trends in incidence, diagnosis, and outcome.","Despite the availability of broad-spectrum antifungal agents, fungal sepsis remains an issue in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. In terms of occurrence rates, the most important fungal infections are invasive candidiasis and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Early diagnosis is essential to optimize the chances of survival. As clinical rules based on risk factor assessment lack specificity, early initiation of antifungal therapy depends on fast and reliable diagnostics. Blood cultures or histopathologic evidence is the gold standard but blood cultures lack sensitivity and biopsy sampling may include substantial risk in critically ill patients. Non-culture-based diagnosis tools have therefore arisen as a smart way to detect earlier and/or more accurately the patients with on going fungal infection. For diagnosing invasive candidiasis, three assays (beta-D-glucan and mannan antigen detection, and polymerase chain reaction) yield promising predictive values, albeit that specificity remains an issue. In the absence of biopsies, invasive pulmonary aspergillosis can be diagnosed in nonneutropenic ICU patients by galactomannan antigen detection in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid. Aspergillus colonization of the respiratory tract can be discriminated from invasive disease by means of a clinical algorithm with high sensitivity but only moderate specificity. The incidence of invasive candidiasis has been stable over the past decades, but an alarming trend towards more non-albicans Candida species and reduced susceptibility is observed. Given the problematic diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis no reliable trend data are available. Outcome following fungal sepsis remains cumbersome. Given the availability of potent antifungal agents any progress in survival is likely to come from a more timely diagnosis. ",2015,23719654,no
Receptor-like kinase SOBIR1/EVR interacts with receptor-like proteins in plant immunity against fungal infection.,"The plant immune system is activated by microbial patterns that are detected as nonself molecules. Such patterns are recognized by immune receptors that are cytoplasmic or localized at the plasma membrane. Cell surface receptors are represented by receptor-like kinases (RLKs) that frequently contain extracellular leucine-rich repeats and an intracellular kinase domain for activation of downstream signaling, as well as receptor-like proteins (RLPs) that lack this signaling domain. It is therefore hypothesized that RLKs are required for RLPs to activate downstream signaling. The RLPs Cf-4 and Ve1 of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) mediate resistance to the fungal pathogens Cladosporium fulvum and Verticillium dahliae, respectively. Despite their importance, the mechanism by which these immune receptors mediate downstream signaling upon recognition of their matching ligand, Avr4 and Ave1, remained enigmatic. Here we show that the tomato ortholog of the Arabidopsis thaliana RLK Suppressor Of BIR1-1/Evershed (SOBIR1/EVR) and its close homolog S. lycopersicum (Sl)SOBIR1-like interact in planta with both Cf-4 and Ve1 and are required for the Cf-4- and Ve1-mediated hypersensitive response and immunity. Tomato SOBIR1/EVR interacts with most of the tested RLPs, but not with the RLKs FLS2, SERK1, SERK3a, BAK1, and CLV1. SOBIR1/EVR is required for stability of the Cf-4 and Ve1 receptors, supporting our observation that these RLPs are present in a complex with SOBIR1/EVR in planta. We show that SOBIR1/EVR is essential for RLP-mediated immunity and propose that the protein functions as a regulatory RLK of this type of cell-surface receptors.",2013,23716655,no
β-Mannanase production by Aspergillus niger BCC4525 and its efficacy on broiler performance.,"Mannan is a hemicellulose constituent commonly found in plant-derived feed ingredients. The gum-like property of mannan can obstruct digestive enzymes and bile acids, resulting in impaired nutrient utilisation. In this study, β-mannanase production by Aspergillus niger strain BCC4525 was investigated using several agricultural residues under solid state condition. The biochemical properties of the target enzyme and the effects of enzyme supplementation on broiler performance and energy utilisation were assessed.Among five carbon sources tested, copra meal was found to be the best carbon source for β-mannanase production with the maximum yield of 1837.5 U g(-1) . The crude β-mannanase exhibited maximum activity at 80 °C within a broad range of pH from 2 to 6. In vitro digestibility assay, which simulates the gastrointestinal tract system of broilers, showed that β-mannanase could liberate reducing sugars from corn/soybean diet. Surprisingly, β-mannanase supplementation had no significant effect on broiler feed intake, feed conversion rate or energy utilisation.A high level of β-mannanase was produced by A. niger BCC4525 under solid state condition using copra meal as carbon source. Although the enzyme has the desired properties of an enzyme additive for improving broiler performance, it does not appear to be beneficial.",2014,23716483,no
Single-dose pharmacodynamics of amphotericin B against Aspergillus species in an in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model.,"Conventional MIC testing of amphotericin B results in narrow MIC ranges challenging the detection of resistant strains. In order to discern amphotericin B pharmacodynamics, the in vitro activity of amphotericin B was studied against Aspergillus isolates with the same MICs by using a new in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model that simulates amphotericin B human plasma levels. Clinical isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus, A. terreus, and A. flavus with the same Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute modal MICs of 1 mg/liter were exposed to amphotericin B concentrations following the plasma concentration-time profile after single-bolus administration with C(max) values of 0.6, 1.2, 2.4, and 4.8 mg/liter. Fungal growth was monitored for up to 72 h based on galactomannan production. Complete growth inhibition was observed only against A. fumigatus with amphotericin B with a Cmax of ≥ 2.4 mg/liter. At the lower C(max) values 0.6 and 1.2 mg/liter, significant growth delays of 34 and 52 h were observed, respectively (P < 0.001). For A. flavus, there was no complete inhibition but a progressive growth delay of 1 to 50 h at an amphotericin B C(max) of 0.6 to 4.8 mg/liter (P < 0.001). For A. terreus, the growth delay was modest (up to 8 h) at all C(max)s (P < 0.05). The C(max) (95% confidence interval) associated with 50% activity for A. fumigatus was 0.60 (0.49 to 0.72) mg/liter, which was significantly lower than for A. flavus 3.06 (2.46 to 3.80) mg/liter and for A. terreus 7.90 (5.20 to 12.29) mg/liter (P < 0.001). A differential in vitro activity of amphotericin B was found among Aspergillus species despite the same MIC in the order A. fumigatus > A. flavus > A. terreus in the in vitro PK/PD model, possibly reflecting the different concentration- and time-dependent inhibitory/killing activities amphotericin B exerted against these species.",2014,23716054,no
Image-based ELISA on an activated polypropylene microtest plate--a spectrophotometer-free low cost assay technique.,"In this communication, we report ELISA technique on an activated polypropylene microtest plate (APPµTP) as an illustrative example of a low cost diagnostic assay. Activated test zone in APPµTP binds a capture biomolecule through covalent linkage thereby, eliminating non-specific binding often prevalent in absorption based techniques. Efficacy of APPµTP is demonstrated by detecting human immunoglobulin G (IgG), human immunoglobulin E (IgE) and Aspergillus fumigatus antibody in patient's sera. Detection is done by taking the image of the assay solution by a desktop scanner and analyzing the color of the image. Human IgE quantification by color saturation in the image-based assay shows excellent correlation with absorbance-based assay (Pearson correlation coefficient, r=0.992). Significance of the relationship is seen from its p value which is 4.087e-11. Performance of APPµTP is also checked with respect to microtiter plate and paper-based ELISA. APPµTP can quantify an analyte as precisely as in microtiter plate with insignificant non-specific binding, a necessary prerequisite for ELISA assay. In contrast, paper-ELISA shows high non-specific binding in control sera (false positive). Finally, we have carried out ELISA steps on APPµTP by ultrasound waves on a sonicator bath and the results show that even in 8 min, it can convincingly differentiate a test sample from a control sample. In short, spectrophotometer-free image-based miniaturized ELISA on APPµTP is precise, reliable, rapid, and sensitive and could be a good substitute for conventional immunoassay procedures widely used in clinical and research laboratories.",2014,23708751,no
Evaluation of The Number of CD4(+) CD25(+) FoxP3(+) Treg Cells in Normal Mice Exposed to AFB1 and Treated with Aged Garlic Extract.,"Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) suppresses the immune system. To decrease such suppressive effects on the immune system, a wide range of herbal medicines like garlic are utilized. Biological activities of garlic in vitro and in vivo have also been verified. Our previous studies demonstrated that aged garlic (dry garlic bulbs preserved in the freezer for six months at -20˚C) have increased immunostimulator fractions and reduced immunosuppressor fractions. This study focuses on the immunosuppressor activity of AFB1 and immunostimulator activity of aged garlic extract (AGE) through the evaluation of CD4(+) CD25(+) FoxP(+) regulator cell (Treg) counts and the pattern of cytokine production in Balb/c normal mice.In this experimental research, AFB1 was separated from Aspergillus flavus (PTCC 5004) by HPLC and AGE prepared using the Mantis method. The Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity (DTH) test was carried out to determinate the effectiveness of different doses of AGE and AFB1, which can both have an effect on the immune system. Subsequent experiments were carried out on 20 Balb/c mice to estimate the effects of AGE and AFB1 on the number of Treg cell in 4 groups: 10 µl/kg/day of AFB1 and AGE diluents were administered for 4 consecutive days to group 1. AFB1, 2. control, 3. AGE + AFB1 and 4. AGE via intraperitoneal (IP) route, respectively. Mice were sacrificed and splenocytes harvested and the percentage of splenic Treg cells was measured by flow cytometry analysis. The ELISA method was utilized to measure Cytokine production.The findings reveal that AGE increased the level of IFN-λ and IL-4 cytokines produced by splenocytes stimulated by specific tumor antigen and decreased the number of Treg cells in the spleen (p<0.05). AFB1 increased the number Treg cells in the spleen and decreased cytokine production (p<0.05). In groups 2 (control) and 4 (AGE) the number of Treg cells decreased (p value<0.05) whereas in groups 1 and 3 the number of Treg cells increased (p<0.05).This study indicated that AGE is able to alter the cytokine production in normal mice into a Th1 protective pattern which is beneficial to the immune system in general and anti-tumor immunity in particular. AFB1 is able to alter the cytokine production into a Th2 protective pattern. Therefore, AGE might be used as herbal medicine with few side effects as compared to chemotherapy in treating cancers caused by substances like AFB1.",2013,23700559,no
Geotrichum capitatum septicemia in a hematological malignancy patient with positive galactomannan antigen: case report and review of the literature.,"Geotrichum capitatum, formerly known as Trichosporon capitatum, is an uncommon but frequently fatal invasive fungal infection in immunocompromised patients, especially in hematological malignancies. We report a seven-year-old patient with acute myeloid leukemia with Geotrichum septicemia with involvement of the lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys, who had a favorable outcome after therapy.

Galactomannan Antigen Testing for Diagnosis of Invasive Aspergillosis in Pediatric Hematology Patients.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) can cause significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised children. The galactomannan (GM) enzyme immunoassay (EIA) has been shown in adult studies to be a useful adjunct in diagnosing IA. Data on this assay in children are limited by small sample sizes and conflicting results false-positive assays were a concern in historical studies. We sought to evaluate the GM EIA in a large cohort of children who received intensive chemotherapy and/or hematopoietic stem cell transplant. A focus was placed on evaluating the assay specificity, and the potential of measuring GM antigen in urine.A multicenter prospective observational study in children with anticipated prolonged neutropenia was performed. Serum specimens were collected twice weekly, and urine was collected once weekly during neutropenic periods. Operating characteristics were calculated using the GM EIA optical density index cutoffs of 0.5 and 1.0 for both serum and urine specimens.At least one serum or urine specimen was tested from 198 patients. Ten patients had one or more repeatedly positive serum specimens, while 37 patients had one or more repeatedly positive urine specimens. The specificity of serum and urine testing was 95% and 80%, respectively. Although the urine test resulted in a higher false positivity rate, it successfully identified the only case of probable IA.Data suggest that the serum GM EIA does not provide frequent false-positive results as previously reported. Screening for galactomannan, or a related antigen in urine, needs to be further evaluated as it may be amenable to development of surveillance strategies.",2013,23687575,no
A new immunoassay to quantify fungal antigens from the indoor mould Aspergillus versicolor.,"Aspergillus versicolor is among the most commonly found moulds in moisture-damaged buildings and can be associated with adverse health effects in humans. This paper reports the development, validation and application of an enzyme immunoassay to quantify A. versicolor antigens. A sandwich ELISA was developed using polyclonal antibodies that recognize a broad range of A. versicolor proteins present in fungal spores and in mycelia fragments. To validate the new method, A. versicolor antigens were quantified in samples collected from homes with visible mould growth, including dust from vacuumed walls and bulk samples of building materials. Antigen concentrations were compared to the results of a commercial ELISA based on monoclonal antibodies (AveX ELISA, Indoor Biotechnologies, Charlottesville, USA) and correlated with colony forming units (CFU) of A. versicolor. The A. versicolor ELISA was very sensitive with a lower detection limit of 120 pg ml(-1). The assay also showed some reactivity to other moulds with strongest reactions with other Aspergillus species (1-3% reactivity). The new assay detected A. versicolor antigens in a much higher percentage of dust samples (88% vs. 27%) and bulk samples (89% vs. 24%) than the AveX assay. A significant correlation (r = 0.67, and p < 0.0001) was found between antigen concentrations and CFU of A. versicolor. Based on its low detection limit and good correlation with the culture-based method, this new immunoassay seems to be a useful tool for the measurement of A. versicolor exposure levels and a reliable complement to the traditional monitoring techniques, such as mould cultivation or microscopy.",2013,23674292,no
High-resolution computed tomographic findings of Aspergillus infection in lung transplant patients.,"The aim of this study was to assess high-resolution computed tomographic (HRCT) findings at presentation in lung transplant patients diagnosed with pulmonary Aspergillus infection.We retrospectively reviewed HRCT findings from 23 patients diagnosed with pulmonary aspergillosis. Imaging studies were performed 2-5 days after the onset of symptoms. The patient sample comprised 12 men and 11 women aged 22-59 years (mean age, 43.6 years). All patients had dyspnea, tachypnea, and cough. Diagnoses were established with Platelia Aspergillus enzyme immunoassays for galactomannan antigen detection in bronchoalveolar lavage and recovery of symptoms, and HRCT findings after voriconazole treatment. The HRCT scans were reviewed independently by two observers who reached a consensus decision.The main HRCT pattern, found in 65% (n=15) of patients, was centrilobular tree-in-bud nodules associated with bronchial thickening. This pattern was described in association with areas of consolidation and ground-glass opacities in 13% (n=3) of patients. Consolidation and ground-glass opacities were the main pattern in 22% (n=5) of patients. The pattern of large nodules with and without the halo sign was observed in 13% (n=3) of patients, and were associated with consolidation and ground-glass opacities in one case.The predominant HRCT findings in lung transplant patients with pulmonary aspergillosis were bilateral bronchial wall thickening and centrilobular opacities with the tree-in-bud pattern. Ground-glass opacities and/or bilateral areas of consolidation were also common findings. Pulmonary nodules with the halo sign were found in only 13% of patients.",2014,23664649,no
Comparison of a novel Aspergillus lateral-flow device and the Platelia® galactomannan assay for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis following haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,"The detection of galactomannan in serum is a cornerstone for the diagnosis of invasive fungal disease (IFD). Because a delay in treatment initiation is associated with a poor outcome, the results have to be available promptly. However, due to methodological and economic reasons, the test frequencies of the commonly used galactomannan assays vary between daily to weekly, meaning that results may be available too late to be clinically useful. The novel Aspergillus lateral-flow device (Aspergillus-LFD) is a rapid test that may overcome these limitations.We compared the diagnostic performance of the Aspergillus-LFD and the Platelia® Aspergillus EIA (GM-EIA) in serum from 101 patients during and after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Clinical data and sera were collected prospectively and patients classified according to the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)/Mycoses Study Group (MSG) 2008 guidelines.By the end of hospitalisation, one proven, nine probable and 20 possible cases of IFD were identified. Depending on the number of positive serum samples required for test positivity, the sensitivities, specificities and diagnostic odds ratios in patients with proven and probable IFD were as follows. One positive serum required: Aspergillus-LFD 40.0 %, 86.8 % and 3.03 GM-EIA 40.0 %, 89.0 % and 3.64. Two positive sera required: Aspergillus-LFD 20.0 %, 97.8 % and 11.13If used as a screening test (one positive serum required for test positivity) or to rule out IFD, the Aspergillus-LFD has shown a comparable diagnostic performance to the GM-EIA. However, if the results have to be confirmed by a second positive serum, the GM-EIA exhibited superior sensitivity. In terms of practicability, the Aspergillus-LFD has demonstrated to be a quick (15 min) and easy-to-use test for single-patient detection of Aspergillus antigens.",2014,23661288,no
"Furry pet allergens, fungal DNA and microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOCs) in the commercial aircraft cabin environment.","There has been concern about the cabin environment in commercial aircraft. We measured cat, dog and horse allergens and fungal DNA in cabin dust and microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOCs) in cabin air. Samples were collected from two European airline companies, one with cabins having textile seats (TSC) and the other with cabins having leather seats (LSC), 9 airplanes from each company. Dust was vacuumed from seats and floors in the flight deck and different parts of the cabin. Cat (Fel d1), dog (Can f1) and horse allergens (Equ cx) were analyzed by ELISA. Five sequences of fungal DNA were analyzed by quantitative PCR. MVOCs were sampled on charcoal tubes in 42 TSC flights, and 17 compounds were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with selective ion monitoring (SIM). MVOC levels were compared with levels in homes from Nordic countries. The weight of dust was 1.8 times larger in TSC cabins as compared to LSC cabins (p < 0.001). In cabins with textile seats, the geometric mean (GM) concentrations of Fel d1, Can f1 and Equ cx were 5359 ng g(-1), 6067 ng g(-1), and 13 703 ng g(-1) (GM) respectively. Levels of Fel d1, Can f1 and Equ cx were 50 times, 27 times and 75 times higher respectively, in TSC cabins as compared to LSC cabins (p < 0.001). GM levels of Aspergillus/Penicillium DNA, Aspergillus versicolor DNA, Stachybotrys chartarum DNA and Streptomyces DNA were all higher in TSC as compared to LSC (p < 0.05). The sum of MVOCs in cabin air (excluding butanols) was 3192 ng m(-3) (GM), 3.7 times higher than in homes (p < 0.001) and 2-methyl-1-butanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol concentrations were 15-17 times higher as compared to homes (p < 0.001). Concentrations of isobutanol, 1-butanol, dimethyldisulfide, 2-hexanone, 2-heptanone, 3-octanone, isobutyl acetate and ethyl-2-methylbutyrate were lower in cabin air as compared to homes (p < 0.05). In conclusion, textile seats are much more contaminated by pet allergens and fungal DNA than leather seats. The use of seats with smooth surfaces should be encouraged. The MVOC levels differed between cabin air and homes.",2013,23644832,no
Prevention and diagnosis of invasive fungal disease in high-risk patients within an integrative care pathway.,"The aim of this study was to assess the clinical utility of enhanced diagnostics on the management of invasive fungal disease in high risk patients within an integrated care pathway and to audit compliance and efficacy of antifungal prophylaxis.A cohort of 549 high risk haematology and stem-cell transplant recipients was followed over a 5 year period. The routine standard of care involved the use of antimould prophylaxis and a neutropenic care pathway utilizing twice weekly antigen and PCR testing.Prophylaxis with itraconazole was poorly tolerated and therapeutic levels could not be maintained. Antigen testing and PCR showed good clinical utility in the management of invasive aspergilosis with high sensitivity (98%) and negative predictive value (99.6%) when both tests were used together, allowing a diagnosis IA to be excluded and obviating the need for empirical antifungal agents. When used serially, multiple positive PCR and antigen test results enabled accurate diagnosis of IA with a specificity of 95% and a positive likelihood ratio of 11. Biomarkers preceded clinical signs in 85% of proven and probable invasive disease.The combination of both tests showed optimum clinical utility for the diagnosis and management of IA in this high risk group.",2014,23644098,yes
Galactomannan and PCR versus culture and histology for directing use of antifungal treatment for invasive aspergillosis in high-risk haematology patients: a randomised controlled trial.,"Empirical treatment with antifungal drugs is often used in haematology patients at high risk of invasive aspergillosis. We compared a standard diagnostic strategy (culture and histology) with a rapid biomarker-based diagnostic strategy (aspergillus galactomannan and PCR) for directing the use of antifungal treatment in this group of patients.In this open-label, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial, eligible patients were adults undergoing allogeneic stem-cell transplantation or chemotherapy for acute leukaemia, with no history of invasive fungal disease. Enrolled patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by a computer-generated schedule to follow either a standard diagnostic strategy (based on culture and histology) or a biomarker-based diagnostic strategy (aspergillus galactomannan and PCR) to direct treatment with antifungal drugs. Patients, were followed up for 26 weeks or until death. Masking of the use of different diagnostic tests was not possible for patients, treating physicians, or investigators. The primary endpoint was empirical treatment with antifungal drugs in the 26 weeks after enrolment (for the biomarker-based diagnostic strategy, a single postive galactomannan or PCR result was deemed insufficient to confirm invasive aspergillosis, so treatment in this context was classified as empirical). This outcome was assessed by an independent data review committee from which the study allocations were masked. Analyses were by intention to treat and included all enrolled patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrial.gov, number NCT00163722.240 eligible patients were recruited from six Australian centres between Sept 30, 2005, and Nov 19, 2009. 122 were assigned the standard diagnostic strategy and 118 the biomarker-based diagnostic strategy. 39 patients (32%) in the standard diagnosis group and 18 (15%) in the biomarker diagnosis group received empirical antifungal treatment (difference 17%, 95% CI 4-26 p=0·002). The numbers of patients who had hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic effects did not differ significantly between the standard diagnosis and biomarker diagnosis groups (hepatotoxic effects: 21 [17%] vs 12 [10%], p=0·11Use of aspergillus galactomannan and PCR to direct treatment reduced use of empirical antifungal treatment.

Pulmonary aspergilloma in a cavity formed after percutaneous radiofrequency ablation.,"We report two cases of pulmonary aspergilloma (PA) in a cavity formed after percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (PRFA), a rare complication that has only been described once in the literature. The first patient was a 59-year-old white woman treated for a secondary lung nodule of an advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. One month after PRFA, a consolidation of a cavity was noticed with an ""air crescent sign,"" and aspergilloma serology was highly positive. A bisegmentectomy was performed due to the proximity of the lesion to mediastinal vessels and the absence of significant regression after antifungal treatment. Histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of PA. The second patient was a 61-year-old white man followed-up for a non-small-cell lung cancer. A cavitation with thick margins in the ablation zone was noticed 6 months after PRFA. A biopsy was performed, and aspergilloma was diagnosed. Medical treatment with itraconazole was administered for 13 months, and there was significant regression.",2014,23636252,no
Fungal diagnosis: how do we do it and can we do better?,"Morbidity and mortality remain high for patients with invasive fungal infections (IFIs) despite an increasing number of antifungals and other treatments. Many studies indicate that delayed or inaccurate diagnosis and treatment are major causes of poor outcomes in patients with IFIs.The aim of the current paper is to provide a review of traditional and newer approaches to the diagnosis of IFIs, with a particular focus on invasive candidiasis (IC) and aspergillosis (IA). Recent studies from the author's institution are highlighted, along with an advancement in cryptococcal meningitis diagnosis that should improve the care of AIDS and its opportunistic infection in many developing countries.Currently available tools for the diagnosis of IFIs include traditional methods like histopathology, culture, and radiology, and newer antigen- and PCR-based diagnostic assays. Attempts have also been made to predict IFIs based on colonization or other factors, including genetic polymorphisms impacting IFI susceptibility in high-risk patients. Biopsy with histopathologic analysis is often not possible in patients suspected of pulmonary aspergillosis due to increased bleeding risk, and blood cultures for IC, IA, or other IFIs are hindered by poor sensitivity and slow turnaround time which delays diagnosis. Radiology is often used to predict IFI but suffers from inability to differentiate certain pathogens and does not generally provide certainty of IFI diagnosis. Newer antigen-based diagnostics for early diagnosis include the β-glucan assay for IFIs, galactomannan assay for IA, and a recent variation on the traditional cryptococcal antigen (CRAG) test with a Lateral Flow Assay for invasive cryptococcosis. PCR-based diagnostics represent additional tools with high sensitivity for the rapid diagnosis of IFIs, although better standardization of these methods is still required for their routine clinical use.Better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of currently available diagnostic tools, and further devising linked strategies to best implement them either alone or in combination, would greatly improve early and accurate diagnosis of IFIs and improve their successful management.",2013,23621588,no
Pretreatment with TLR2 and TLR4 ligand modulates innate immunity in corneal fibroblasts challenged with Aspergillus fumigatus.,"To study the innate immunity in telomerase-immortalized human stroma fibroblasts (THSFs) challenged with Aspergillus fumigatus hyphae after copretreatment with TLR2 and TLR4 ligand.THSFs were pretreated with different concentrations of zymosan and/or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at different time periods, and challenged with high-dose Aspergillus fumigatus hyphae. The gene expression and protein secretion of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8) were detected by RT-PCR and ELISA. The effects of stimulation or pretreatment of TLR ligands on proliferation of THSFs were measured by MTT analysis.In the certain concentration range, pretreatment of THSFs with zymosan suppressed gene expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6). Copretreatment with zymosan and LPS suppressed gene expression and protein secretion more strongly compared with pretreatment with zymosan or LPS alone. Zymosan and/or LPS pretreatment suppressed lethal effect of A. fumigatus to THSFs in a certain period.Pretreatment of THSFs with TLR2-specific ligand zymosan results in a state of A. fumigatus hyphae tolerance. Copretreatment with TLR2 and -4 ligands (zymosan and LPS) leads to a stronger state of A. fumigatus hyphae tolerance, and suppresses the lethal effect of A. fumigatus.",2013,23633661,no
The utility of galactomannan antigen in the bronchial washing and serum for diagnosing pulmonary aspergillosis.,"The diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis is difficult because the sensitivity of the conventional methods for the detection of Aspergillus such as culture and cytology, is poor. To improve the sensitivity for Aspergillus detection, the detection of galactomannan antigen has been investigated. The serum galactomannan (GM) antigen has been recognized to be a useful tool for the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. However, the utility of the galactomannan antigen for the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis other than invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) has been unclear.The GM antigen using serum and bronchial washing (BW) using bronchofiberscopy for the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis other than IPA were measured.In 45 enrolled patients, 7 patients had pulmonary aspergillosis, 5 of these patients had chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis and 2 patients had allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.89 for the BW GM antigen detection test, and 0.41 for the serum GM antigen detection test, suggesting that the BW GM antigen detection test exhibits a better diagnostic performance than the serum GM antigen detection test. The BW GM antigen detection test had a sensitivity of 85.7% and a specificity of 76.3% at a cut-off level of ≥0.5, which was the optimal cut-off level obtained by the ROC curve.The BW GM antigen detection test is thought to be a promising test for the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis other than IPA.",2014,23632100,no
Aspergillus vertebral osteomyelitis in immunocompetent subjects: case report and review of the literature.,"Aspergillus spondylodiscitis (AS) is rare in immunocompetent (IC) patients. A 65-year-old diabetic IC male subject presented with cervical AS 18 months after otomycosis. Two serological tests, mastoidectomy and biopsy of the sphenoid bone, were negative. A prevertebral biopsy identified A. flavus. The patient was successfully treated with voriconazole. Forty-three cases of AS in IC patients have been published. A predisposition was found in 84 % of cases. Fever was reported in 20 % of cases, whereas neurological defects were present in 41 %. Serology was inconsistently positive (5/7) and diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy or surgery. A. fumigatus was the most frequently isolated species (74 %). All episodes were medically treated, associated with surgery in 57 % of cases, and 73 % of patients fully recovered. AS must be discussed in IC patients presenting with risk factors, including diabetes mellitus. Biopsy is necessary to confirm diagnosis, since serology offers low sensitivity. Nevertheless, the prognosis is good.",2013,23625788,no
[Isolation of Scedosporium apiospermum (teleomorph: Pseudallescheria apiosperma) from an acute myeloid leukemia patient].,"Scedosporium apiospermum is an emerging opportunistic pathogen that may lead to life-threatening infections especially in immunosuppressive individuals. In this report, S.apiospermum infection in a 62 year old male patient with acute myeloid leukemia was presented. During remission-induction chemotherapy, piperacillin-tazobactam therapy was started for febrile neutropenia. Since fever had continued, treatment was switched to imipenem and also amphotericin B deoxycholate was added to the treatment protocol. Because of allergic reaction to amphotericin B, caspofungin was started at the fifth day of neutropenic fever. Following imaging studies with high resolution computerized thorasic tomography, antifungal therapy was changed to voriconazole due to findings suggestive of invasive aspergillosis. Since galactomannan antigen was found negative at the first day of voriconazole therapy, bronchoalveolar lavage material from apical segment of the left lower lobe was cultured onto various microbiologic media. S.apiospermum (Teleomorph: Pseudallescheria apiosperma) was isolated on the fourth day of cultivation. According to CLSI M38-A2 microdilution procedure, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of voriconazole, caspofungin, amphotericin B and posaconazole were found as 0.06, 2, 8 and 4 µg/ml, respectively. Since neutropenia was resolved, the patient was discharged with continued voriconazole therapy. It was concluded that antifungal susceptibility tests should be performed for Scedosporium species and the results should be compared to the clinical response. The determination of MIC breakpoints may provide useful information for the recommendation and use of optimal choices for the treatment of Scedosporium infections.",2014,23621736,no
Combined real-time PCR and galactomannan surveillance improves diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in high risk patients with haematological malignancies.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a leading complication of intensive treatment for haematological malignancies. Earlier diagnosis should facilitate effective antifungal therapy and prevent progression to invasive disease, which is often lethal. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, targeting the 28S and ITS ribosomal gene regions respectively, were evaluated for early detection of Aspergillus DNA and for diagnostic utility in patients receiving treatment in two busy haematopoietic stem cell transplant centres. Patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy, autologous or allogeneic transplant were eligible for inclusion in the study. EDTA blood and serum samples for circulating Aspergillus biomarkers, including galactomannan (GM), were collected twice-weekly on a prospective basis from all study patients who were categorized according to international consensus criteria for defining invasive fungal disease (IFD). Of 278 patients recruited there were 44 probable IA cases and only one proven case. Moderate sensitivity and specificity, poor positive predictive value (50-80%), but good negative predictive value (>80-90%) were common to both PCR assays. Overall biomarker performance could be improved by combining positive results of either PCR assay with GM taken within a 12-d period. The addition of PCR to GM monitoring in high-risk patients with haematological malignancies provides greater diagnostic accuracy in invasive aspergillosis.",2013,23614624,no
Mould and mycotoxin contamination of pig feed in northwest Croatia.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the contamination of pig feed with moulds and the occurrence of mycotoxins. A total of 30 feed samples were collected at different animal feed factories in the north-western part of Croatia. Mycological analysis showed that the total number of moulds ranged from 1 × 10(3) to 1 × 10(5) cfu/g with samples contaminated with Aspergillus spp. (63 %), Penicillium spp. (80 %), and Fusarium spp. (77 %). A determination of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), ochratoxin A (OTA), zearalenone (ZEA), deoxynivalenol (DON), T-2 toxin (T-2) and fumonisin (FUM) concentration was done using the validated ELISA method. The mean concentrations of AFB1 (0.5 ± 0.6 μg/kg), OTA (1.53 ± 0.42 μg/kg) and FUM (405 ± 298 μg/kg) were below the maximum levels or recommended values in the EU in all the investigated samples. The observed results indicated an increased contamination of pig feed with Fusarium mycotoxins DON and ZEA with mean concentrations of 817 ± 447 and 184 ± 214 μg/kg, higher than recommended in 40 and 17 % of the analysed samples, respectively.",2013,23606122,no
Graphene oxide as nanocarrier for sensitive electrochemical immunoassay of clenbuterol based on labeling amplification strategy.,"A novel electrochemical immunosensor for sensitive detection of clenbuterol (CLB) is fabricated using glucose oxidase (GOD)-functionalized grahene oxide (GO) nanocomposites to label CLB. The immunosensor was constructed by layer-by-layer assembly colloidal prussian blue (PB), multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and CLB antibodies (Abs) on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). In this competitive immunoassay system, PB acts as the redox mediator to reduce H2O2 originated from the catalyst cycle of GOD. The high ratio of GOD to GO effectively amplified the signal for this competitive-type immunoassay. Under optimized conditions, the immunosensor shows a wide linear range from 0.5 to 1,000 ng/mL with a low detection limit of 0.25 ng/mL. The dual signal amplification of GOD-functionalized GO nanocomposites as a label is promising to be applied to design other sensitive immunosenseors.",2013,23598209,no
Development of ultrasensitive direct chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay for determination of aflatoxin B1 in food products.,"A direct competitive chemiluminescent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (CL-ELISA) for determination of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) was developed. To improve the assay sensitivity, a mixture of 3-(10'-phenothiazinyl)-propane-1-sulfonate and 4-morpholinopyridine previously optimized by a factorial design was used as enhancer of horseradish peroxidase-induced chemiluminescence. Varying the concentrations of the coating anti-AFB1 antibody and conjugate of AFB1 and horseradish peroxidase the conditions of the chemiluminescent assay were optimized. The values of the detection limit value and dynamic working range of CL-ELISA of AFB1 were 0.0015 ng mL(-1) and 0.003-0.03 ng mL(-1), respectively. It was shown that a dilution of rice and mung beans extracts in 5 and 10 times, respectively, prevented a matrix effect of the food products in CL-ELISA. The recovery values from the spiked samples of rice and mung beans were in the range of 90-104% and 102-117%, respectively. Studying 8 rice and 8 mung beans samples purchased in commercial stores the developed CL-ELISA allowed to find 3 samples (1 rice and 2 mung beans) containing AFB1, the content of AFB1 in one sample being higher than the maximum acceptable level established in the European Community.",2013,23598187,no
Immunochemical approach for zearalenone-4-glucoside determination.,"Zearalenone-4-β-D-glucopyranoside (zearalenone-4-glucoside) detection techniques, based on a combination of acidic or enzymatic hydrolysis of the masked mycotoxin to the parent form (i.e. zearalenone), and immunochemical determination of zearalenone-4-glucoside as a difference between the zearalenone concentration after and before cleavage of the glycosidic bond were developed. The limit of detection for zearalenone-4-glucoside, achieved for the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, was 3 μg kg(-1) the cut-off level for the sum of zearalenone and zearalenone-4-glucoside determination by a qualitative gel-based immunoassay was 50 μg kg(-1). Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid was checked for acidic hydrolysis and resulted in approximately 70% of glycosidic bond cleavage in optimal conditions. Seven different glycoside hydrolases were tested during the design of the enzymatic hydrolysis technique. Enzymatic hydrolysis combined with enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and gel-based immunoassay determinations was applied for the determination of zearalenone-4-glucoside or the sum of zearalenone and zearalenone-4-glucoside in cereal samples. The chosen enzyme (glucosidase from Aspergillus niger) allowed to cleave 102% of zearalenone-4-glucoside in standard solutions and 85% in cereal samples. Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry was used as confirmatory method. As a result, good correlations between immunochemical techniques and the chromatographic data were obtained. The developed technique is suitable for simultaneous immunochemical determination of zearalenone and its masked form, zearalenone-4-glucoside.",2013,23598147,no
Analysis of the titer and reactivity of antibody/ies against fungal cell wall β-glucans in human sera.,"The aim of this work was to characterize an antibody response to β-glucan (BG), a major component of the fungal cell wall, at each isotype in human sera. The titer and reactivity of the anti-human BG antibody were examined using enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay plates coated with Candida soluble cell wall β-glucan as a standard antigen. The antibody was detected using anti-human immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgM, and IgA. Its major class was IgG in all subjects. The antibody titer varied significantly. The anti-BG antibody showed greater reactivity to β-glucans derived from pathogenic fungi than monoglycosyl-branched β-glucans derived from mycelia culture medium. In addition, it was suggested that the anti-BG IgM antibody was bound relatively strongly to the β1,3-glucan backbone and the anti-BG IgG antibody to β1,6-glucan. The anti-BG antibody plays a variety of roles, according to class, in the host's response to fungi. We propose a new index of human response to β-glucan that effects the understanding of the response to β-glucan in humans.",2013,23557364,no
[A double-antigen sandwich ELISA for detecting Penicillium marneffei Mp1p-specific antibody].,"To establish an immunological method for detecting antibodies of Penicillium marneffei.The recombinant Mp1p protein of Penicillium marneffei was expressed in Pichia pastoris and labeled with HRP (Mp1p-HRP) with a modified sodium periodate method. A double-antigen sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) was established by determining the optimal coating concentration of Mp1p protein and the concentration of the detecting protein Mp1p-HRP. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay was evaluated by detecting Mp1p antibodies in 100 serum samples from healthy donors, 15 samples from culture-confirmed penicilliosis patients, and 21 samples from patients with culture-confirmed other fungal infections.A double-antigen sandwich ELISA was successfully established for detecting Mp1p-specific antibody. The specificity of the assay was 100% (121/121) for detecting Mp1p-specific antibody in the sera from healthy donors and patients with other fungal infection. The detection results of the 15 serum samples from patients with culture-confirmed penicilliosis showed positivity for Mp1p antibody in 2 samples and Mp1p antigen positivity in 12 samples combining the detection results of Mp1p antigen and antibody obviously increased the diagnostic sensitivity to 93.3% (14/15).The double-antigen sandwich ELISA shows a high specificity in detecting Mp1p-specific antibody, and simultaneous detection of Mp1p antigen and antibody can increase the diagnostic sensitivity for penicilliosis.",2014,23529249,no
Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid galactomannan detection for diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is difficult to diagnose in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether detection of galactomannan (GM) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) might be a useful means of making the diagnosis. Patients with COPD and new pulmonary infiltrates were enrolled. BALF was collected for culture and detection of GM. Venous blood was also sampled for GM detection. Biopsy samples were obtained whenever possible. Eleven cases of IPA were diagnosed (three proven and eight probable) 80 controls without IPA diagnosed were recruited. At a GM cut-off of 0.5, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for diagnosing IPA were 90.9, 66.3, 27.0 and 98.1% in serum, and 90.9, 62.5, 25.0 and 98.0% in BALF, respectively.

Intravenous antibiotics reduce the presence of Aspergillus in adult cystic fibrosis sputum.,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aspergillus fumigatus frequently co-colonise the airways of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). This study aimed to assess the impact of short-term administration of intravenous antipseudomonal antibiotics during CF exacerbations on the presence of Aspergillus.Pre- and post-antibiotic sputum samples from 26 adult patients with CF and chronic Pseudomonas colonisation were analysed for the presence of Aspergillus by fungal culture, real-time PCR and galactomannan antigen (GM). Lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s and forced vital capacity % predicted) and blood levels of total IgE, specific A fumigatus IgE and specific A fumigatus IgG were measured at the start and end of antibiotics. Respiratory viral real-time PCR and bacterial community profiling using ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (RISA) were performed to estimate concurrent changes in the lung microbiome.Aspergillus PCR and GM were more sensitive than culture in detecting Aspergillus species (culture 8%, GM 31%, PCR 77%). There was a significant decline in the presence of Aspergillus, measured both by PCR and GM index, following antibacterial therapy (PCR: median increase in crossing threshold 1.7 (IQR 0.5-3.8), p<0.001 GM: median fall in GM index 0.7 (IQR 0.4-1.6), p=0.016). All patients improved clinically with a significant increase in lung function (p<0.0001). RISA community analysis showed large changes in bacterial community similarity in 67% of patients following antibiotics. Viral RT-PCR demonstrated the presence of a concurrent respiratory virus in 27% of patients.Intravenous antibiotics targeting Pseudomonas during CF pulmonary exacerbations have a negative impact on the presence of Aspergillus in sputum samples.",2013,23513028,no
Variables affecting the performance of galactomannan assay in high-risk patients at a tertiary care centre in India.,"Diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in immunocompromised patients using galactomannan ELISA (GM-ELISA) has shown variable sensitivity and specificity.To assess the diagnostic performance of GM-ELISA and analyze the effect of decreasing the cut off value, neutropenia, antifungals and piperacillin-tazobactam (PTZ). Prognostic value using 30 day all-cause mortality was also determined.Serum samples from 81 patients categorized into ""proven,"" ""probable,"" and ""possible,"" categories based on revised EORTC/MSG definitions were tested by GM-ELISA.Sensitivity of GM-ELISA in proven, probable and possible cases was 91.7%, 84.6% and 83.3% respectively. At an index cut-off value of 0.5 an increased sensitivity with minimal loss of specificity was observed. Use of antifungals demonstrated a decrease in sensitivity in proven and possible cases whereas it remained unaffected in probable category. Specificity increased from 75% to 100% with a positivity criterion of >2 consecutive samples. Although an increase in specificity was observed in patients not receiving PTZ, it was not statistically significant. Serial GM index values increased significantly in neutropenic patients and were associated with a poor prognosis.GM-ELISA may be a useful diagnostic and prognostic modality for the detection of IA in high risk patients.",2013,23508427,no

Utility of galactomannan antigen detection in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in immunocompromised patients.,"Diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a challenging process in immunocompromised patients. Galactomannan (GM) antigen detection in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid is a method to detect IPA with improved sensitivity over conventional studies. We sought to determine the diagnostic yield of BAL GM assay in a diverse population of immunocompromised patients. A retrospective review of 150 fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) with BAL for newly diagnosed pulmonary infiltrate in immunocompromised patients was performed. Patient information, procedural details and laboratory studies were collected. BAL and serum samples were evaluated for GM using enzyme-linked immunoassay. Of 150 separate FOB with BAL, BAL GM was obtained in 143 samples. There were 31 positive BAL GM assays. In those 31 positive tests, 13 were confirmed as IPA, giving a positive predictive value of 41.9%. There was one false negative BAL GM. Of the 18 false positive BAL GM, 4 were receiving piperacillin-tazobactam and 11 were receiving an alternative beta-lactam antibiotic. BAL GM assay shows excellent sensitivity for diagnosing IPA. There was a significant number of false positive BAL GM assays and several of those patients were receiving beta-lactam antibiotics at the time of bronchoscopy. ",2014,23496321,no
A Magneto-Nanosensor Immunoassay for Sensitive Detection of Aspergillus Fumigatus Allergen Asp f 1.,"We report a magneto-nanosensor biochip for fungal detection. The chip is made of arrays of giant magnetoresistive (GMR) spin-valve sensors, and is able to detect protein biomarkers at low concentrations in solutions. As a demonstration, a standard curve for fungal pathogen Asp f 1 was obtained by measuring signals from various concentrations of Asp f 1 spiked in PBS solutions, indicating a detection limit of ~100 pg/ml. Five positive and negative Asp f 1 solution samples were discriminated correctly in blind experiments. Our data suggest that the magneto-nanosensor biochips are very promising as sensitive diagnostic devices for fungal pathogens. Given the generality of the detection scheme used in the magneto-nanosensor, we anticipate that the platform will be very useful for the detection of many types of biomarkers.",2013,23494403,no
"Evaluation of real-time PCR, galactomannan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and a novel lateral-flow device for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.","Diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) remains challenging. With a relatively low incidence of disease, the use of expensive empirical antifungal therapy exposes many patients to unnecessary toxicity. Diagnosis places emphasis on specific but temporal radiological evidence. Circulating biomarker diagnosis has shown potential, but assays show variable performance, take several hours to perform, and require a degree of technical ability. A novel and simple lateral-flow device (LFD) using monoclonal antibody JF5, which targets an extracellular glycoprotein, has been developed and potentially removes any technical requirements, reducing processing time considerably. In this study, we evaluate the performance of this LFD compared to real-time PCR (targeting the 28S rRNA gene) and galactomannan (GM) detection when testing serum from a European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG)-defined hematological population. In a proven/probable-IA population versus a no-IA population, the LFD performance was comparable to that of both PCR and galactomannan enzyme immunoassay. Specificity (98.0%) was similar to that of PCR (96.6%) and slightly superior to that of GM (91.5%). Sensitivity (81.8%) was inferior to that of PCR (95.5%) but better than that of GM (77.3%). In combination with PCR, it provided both 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The LFD permits rapid testing of easily obtainable specimens, to be used as an adjunct test, before confirmation by other investigations. Its simplicity provides centers without specialist diagnostics with a test with clinical performance superior to that of classical microbiological approaches and results that can be used to direct antifungal management. In summary, microbiological diagnosis of IA is difficult and options are limited, with variable performance. An LFD assay targeting a novel specific biomarker has been developed, one which is methodologically simple and provides good clinical performance, particularly if combined with PCR.",2013,23486712,no
Azole resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples of patients with chronic diseases.,"Triazole resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus has been increasing. We explored the A. fumigatus azole resistance profiles in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples from Danish patients examined for aspergillosis.A total of 94 BAL samples from 87 patients were evaluated by galactomannan (GM) test and A. fumigatus CYP51A profiling by PCR.Aspergillus spp. were isolated from 27/48 (56.3%) cultured samples, including 23 A. fumigatus with one resistant strain (4.3%). Samples were classified into GM-positive (≥3.0), GM-intermediate (0.5 to <3.0) and GM-negative (<0.5) groups, where the CYP51A PCR was positive in 81.8% (36/44), 56.3% (18/32) and 38.9% (7/18) of samples, respectively. Nine CYP51A PCR-positive samples (9/61, 14.8%) were found to have mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions. M220V was detected from a sample culture positive for susceptible A. fumigatus and P216L was found in a culture-negative BAL sample. Conversely, no mutation was found in one sample culture positive for azole-resistant A. fumigatus. The tandem repeat/L98H mutation was not detected.Our study shows that azole resistance in A. fumigatus can be cryptic and may go undiagnosed. The combination of improved culture/susceptibility tests and the direct molecular detection of resistance markers will facilitate prompt institution of appropriate antifungal therapy.",2013,23463213,no
A 6-year antifungal stewardship programme in a teaching hospital.,"To describe the antifungal stewardship programme in our hospital and to assess its impact on total antifungal prescriptions and their cost, and on the process of care measures regarding the diagnostic and therapeutic management of invasive aspergillosis and candidaemia.We conducted a prospective observational study describing the multifaceted antifungal stewardship programme in place at our French teaching tertiary-care hospital since 2005. Several actions were implemented successively, including the systematic evaluation of all costly antifungal prescriptions (echinocandins, lipid formulations of amphotericin B, posaconazole and voriconazole).A total of 636 antifungal prescriptions were discussed by the antifungal management team from 2005 to 2010 inclusive, mainly from the haematology department (72 %). In 344/636 cases (54 %), a piece of advice was fed back to the physician in charge of the patient, with an 88 % compliance rate. Optimal standard of care was achieved for galactomannan antigen testing, performance of chest computed tomography (CT) scan and voriconazole therapeutic drug monitoring for invasive aspergillosis, with no combination therapies used since 2008. Regarding candidaemia, optimal standard of care was achieved for the timing of antifungal therapy, recommended first-line therapy, duration of therapy and the removal of central venous catheters. Total antifungal prescriptions (in defined daily doses, DDD) and their cost were contained between 2003 and 2010.The implementation of an antifungal stewardship programme was feasible, sustainable and well accepted.

Confirming the diagnosis is rarely accomplished as invasive procedures are impaired by neutropenia and low platelet count. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures or galactomannan (GM) regularly yield negative results thus suggesting the need for improving diagnostic procedures. Therefore the performance of an established Aspergillus-specific nested polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) in CSF samples of immunocompromised patients with suspicion of CNS IA was evaluated. We identified 113 CSF samples from 55 immunocompromised patients for whom CNS aspergillosis was suspected. Of these patients 8/55 were identified as having proven/probable CNS IA while the remaining 47 patients were classified as having either possible (n = 22) or no CNS IA (n = 25). PCR positivity in CSF was observed for 8/8 proven/probable, in 4/22 possible CNS IA patients and in 2/25 NoIA patients yielding sensitivity and specificity values of 1.0 (95% CI 0.68-1) and 0.93 (95% CI 0.77-0.98) and a positive likelihood ratio of 14 and negative likelihood ratio of 0.0, respectively, thus resulting in a diagnostic odds ratio of ∞. The retrospective analysis of CSF samples from patients with suspected CNS IA yielded a high sensitivity of the nested PCR assay. PCR testing of CSF samples is recommended for patients for whom CNS IA is suspected, especially for those whose clinical condition does not allow invasive procedures as a positive PCR result makes the presence of CNS IA in that patient population highly likely.",2013,23451071,no
Aspergillus galactomannan antigen for diagnosis and treatment monitoring in cerebral aspergillosis.,"Invasive aspergillosis, especially neuroaspergillosis, predominantly affects immunocompromised patients such as transplant recipients. Early diagnosis and subsequent early initiation of therapy may improve final outcome. In cerebral aspergillosis, samples for culture or histopathology, the diagnostic reference standard, are often impossible to obtain without risk. Because of these limitations, serological, nucleic acid amplification tests such as polymerase chain reaction or enzyme immunoassay from cerebrospinal fluid appear advantageous for early diagnosis and probably also for therapy monitoring. We report on the successful detection and treatment monitoring by serial testing of galactomannan in cerebrospinal fluid in a patient with neuroaspergillosis after heart transplant.",2013,23448824,no
The Role of Biomarkers for Diagnosis of and Therapeutic Decisions Related to Invasive Aspergillosis in Children.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a feared opportunistic infection for many immuncompromised children resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Timely diagnosis based on traditional testing modalities and clinical evaluation has proven to be challenging. Assays designed to measure IA biomarkers such as galactomannan (GM) and beta-D-glucan (BG) represent a potential significant improvement in the ability to diagnose pediatric IA. However, as with any new diagnostic tool, clinicians need to be aware of the operating characteristics of these assays in order to apply them in the appropriate settings. Published adult and pediatric data regarding GM and BG testing are reviewed and guidance regarding the appropriate utility of these assays in children is offered.",2013,23439763,no
Sensitivity of galactomannan enzyme immunoassay for diagnosing breakthrough invasive aspergillosis under antifungal prophylaxis and empirical therapy.,"Data on diagnostic performance of Galactomannan (GM) testing in patients under mould-active regimens are limited. Whether sensitivity of GM testing for diagnosing breakthrough invasive aspergillosis (IA) is decreased under antifungal prophylaxis/therapy remains therefore a point of discussion. We retrospectively analysed GM test results in patients who were admitted with underlying haematological malignancies to two Divisions of the Medical University Hospital of Graz, Austria, between 2009 and 2012. Only cases of probable and proven IA that were diagnosed by other methods than GM testing were included (time of diagnosis = day 0). We compared GM results of patients with/without therapy/prophylaxis for the period of 2 weeks prior (week -2) until 3 weeks postdiagnosis. A total of 76 GM test results in nine patients were identified. Six patients had received antifungal therapy/prophylaxis from week -2, whereas three patients were treated with therapy from the time of diagnosis at week 0. GM testing was positive in 45/76 (59%) of samples. Sensitivity of GM testing for detection of proven or probable IA at week -1 and 0 was 77% and 79% in patients with mould-active regimens. We conclude that GM testing might be a useful diagnostic method for breakthrough IA in patients receiving mould-active prophylaxis/therapy.",2013,23432536,no
Multicenter comparison of serum and whole-blood specimens for detection of Aspergillus DNA in high-risk hematological patients.,"Samples from patients at high risk for invasive aspergillosis (IA) were prospectively collected and analyzed for the presence of molecular markers of fungal infection. Serum specimens were screened for galactomannan and Aspergillus DNA, and whole-blood specimens were screened only for Aspergillus DNA. Fungal infections were categorized according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria. Forty-seven cases (proven and probable IA) and 31 controls (no evidence of IA) were selected retrospectively for this case-control study, comprising 803 samples, in order to determine the performance of whole-blood PCR, serum PCR, and serum galactomannan testing. Although no single assay was able to detect every case of IA, a combination of different assays provided the best performance. There was no significant difference between the use of whole-blood and serum specimens for PCR-based diagnosis of IA, but there was a trend for whole blood to be more sensitive (85% versus 79%) and to yield an earlier positive result (36 days versus 15 days) than for serum. However, DNA extraction from serum specimens is easier and faster than that from whole-blood specimens, and it allows the same specimen to be used for both galactomannan and PCR assays. In conclusion, the appropriate sample type for DNA extraction should be determined by the local requirements and the technical platforms available at each individual center. A combination of biomarker tests offered the best diagnostic utility for detecting IA.",2013,23426930,no
Advancing the Field: Evidence for New Management Strategies in Invasive Fungal Infections.,"Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised. The traditional diagnostic methods of culture and histological examination lack sensitivity and often only make a diagnosis late when the fungal burden is high, reducing the chances of cure even with the availability of new more potent and less toxic antifungal agents. New non-culture-based serological and PCR assays have been developed. These appear more sensitive and are able to make an earlier diagnosis as compared with traditional diagnostic methods. Early diagnosis is central to reducing IFI-related morbidity and mortality. This review describes the diagnostic potential of the new serological and PCR assays and outlines how these assays have been incorporated into algorithms to improve the management of IFI.",2013,23420637,no
Pulmonary aspergilloma.,"Aspergillosis is a serious pathologic condition caused by Aspergillus organisms and is frequently seen in immunocompromised patients. Aspergillus species causes a variety of pulmonary diseases such as saphrophyticus (aspergilloma/mycetoma), hypersensitivity reaction (allergic bronhopulmonary), semi- invasive (chronic necrotizing) and angioinvasive aspergillosis.We report a case of pulmonary aspergilloma (PA) in 38 years old patient who was previously healthy with complaints of fever and hemoptysis.

Comparison of galactomannan enzyme immunoassay performance levels when testing serum and plasma samples.,"Diagnostic galactomannan (GM) enzyme immunoassay (EIA) testing is formally validated only for serum, though in practice, plasma is occasionally tested. It is assumed, but not confirmed, that results will be comparable to those for serum. GM EIA when testing plasma was evaluated, providing sensitivity (85.7%) and specificity (85.4%) comparable to those for serum. Plasma index values were higher than those for serum if plasma GM EIA were used to define probable cases, four additional cases would have been diagnosed.",2013,23389933,yes
Mannosyl-recognizing receptors induce an M1-like phenotype in macrophages of susceptible mice but an M2-like phenotype in mice resistant to a fungal infection.,"In addition to alpha1,3 glucan, mannan and mannan-linked proteins are expressed in the outer layer of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis yeasts. The recognition of mannosyl residues by multiple pathogen recognition receptors, such as the mannose receptor (MR), complement receptor 3 (CR3) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on macrophage membranes can influence macrophage activation and the mechanisms of innate immunity against fungal pathogens. The aim of this study was to clarify the role of these receptors in the interaction between P. brasiliensis and macrophages from resistant (A/J) and susceptible (B10.A) mice. Therefore, the phagocytic, fungicidal and secretory abilities of macrophages were evaluated in the presence of mannan and antibodies against MR, CR3 and TLR4. We verified that mannan increased and anti-MR antibody decreased the killing ability and nitric oxide production of macrophages. The specific blockade of MR, CR3 and TLR4 by monoclonal antibodies impaired fungal recognition and modulated the production of cytokines. Mannan or P. brasiliensis induced decreased expression of MR and TLR2 on A/J macrophages, whereas CR3, TLR4 and TLR2 were reduced on B10.A cells. Importantly, both mannan and P. brasiliensis induced the production of IL-12 by B10.A macrophages, whereas TGF-β, TNF-α and IL-6 were produced by A/J cells. In addition, B10.A macrophages exhibited a prevalent expression of inducible NO-synthase and SOCS3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling-3), indicating a pro-inflammatory, ""M1-like"" differentiation. In contrast, the elevated expression of arginase-1, found in inflammatory zone-1 (FIZZ1), YM1 (CHI313, chitinase-like lectin), and SOCS1, typical markers of alternatively activated macrophages, indicates a prevalent ""M2-like"" differentiation of A/J macrophages. In conclusion, our data reveal that several mannosyl-recognizing receptors coordinate the apparently paradoxical innate response to paracoccidioidomycosis, in which resistance is initially mediated by alternatively activated phagocytes and tolerance to fungal growth, whereas susceptibility is linked to classically activated macrophages and the efficient control of fungal growth.",2013,23382985,no
[Detection of Aspergillus antigen galactomannan using ELISA method: validation of the performances of the method for accreditation].,"Diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis for patients with high risk of infection is based on the monitoring of Aspergillus antigenemia assessed by the detection of galactomannan in serum by a sandwich-type ELISA (Biorad(®)). The validation of the method was displayed according to the guide COFRAC SH GTA 04. The internal quality control system settled, involves two quality control samples made of pools of sera (negative and positive). The repeatability of the measurements, as estimated by the coefficients of variation (CV), obtained by two different technicians was found from 9 to 13.7% for the positive control. The CV of the negative control, for which the provider indicates it is not useful in the analytical process, was found from 7.1 to 30%. In our experience it could be an indicator of environmental contamination. The evaluation of the intermediary fidelity was 15.7% for the positive control and 22.5% for the negative one. In the lack of reference material (International Standard) and recommendation from scientific societies, performances obtained will be discussed according to the results reported in the technical form of the supplier and those obtained by 39 laboratories participating in the only available external quality assessment program organized in France by ProBioQual(®) where the CV of reproducibility are 44.7% of unit (mean index 0.131) for the negative control and 18% (mean index 1.089) for the positive one in 2011.",2014,23375860,no
Serum galactomannan assay for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in children with haematological malignancies.,"Diagnostic efficacy of Galactomannan (GM) assay for invasive aspergillosis (IA) is variably reported. Data from developing countries are scant. Children with haematological malignancies and fever were enrolled prospectively. Blood sample for GM was drawn on the day of admission levels were measured with Platellia Aspergillus enzyme immunoassay. Diagnostic criteria were adapted from EORTC-MSG-2002. Proven, probable and possible episodes were considered as the disease group. One hundred febrile episodes in 78 patients were evaluated. The mean age was 6.1 years. Majority (75%) episodes were in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. One episode each was diagnosed with proven and probable IA, while 23 were diagnosed with possible IA. Best results were obtained with a cut-off value of 1.0, with sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of 60%, 93%, 75 and 87 respectively. The sensitivity dropped to 40%, at cut-off value of 1.5 and specificity was 38%, at a cut-off of 0.5. A higher value of GM correlated with pulmonary nodules (P = 0.037) and mortality (P = 0.001). GM assay is adjunctive to clinical/radiological evidence. A negative GM assay may not reassure the physician against the use of amphotericin in patients with febrile neutropenia, as it does not exclude the diagnosis of clinically relevant other fungal infections, particular mucormycosis.",2013,23369047,yes

Clinical utility of a panfungal polymerase chain reaction assay for invasive fungal diseases in patients with haematologic disorders.,"Invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) are life-threatening events in patients with haematologic disorders, and the spectrum of the aetiological pathogens continues to expand. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of a panfungal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the management of IFDs in such patients.We prospectively analysed 273 consecutive blood samples from 64 risk episodes in 51 patients with haematologic disorders at high risk for IFD who were treated at our hospital between April 2007 and October 2010.PCR-positive results were obtained in 18 of 64 risk episodes (35.3%). IFD was documented in 14 episodes (21.9%, 9 probable IFDs and 5 possible IFDs) according to the revised criteria of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group. PCR was positive in all of these 14 episodes, and in 4 of the 50 episodes with no IFD category. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of our assay were 100%, 92%, 78% and 100% respectively. A considerable number of fungi (44.4%) that are less common than Aspergillus and Candida species were positive by PCR. Molecular diagnoses of Cunninghamella species, Aspergillus ustus, Fusarium species, Scedosporium apiospermum, Rhodotorula species and Rhizopus species were beneficial in selecting suitable treatments.Our panfungal PCR approach allows for the highly sensitive and specific detection and identification of a wide spectrum of fungal pathogens, which provides indispensable information for managing IFDs, especially refractory or breakthrough IFDs during antifungal therapy in high-risk patients with haematologic disorders.",2013,23360173,no
Performance of two Aspergillus IgG EIA assays compared with the precipitin test in chronic and allergic aspergillosis.,"Detection of Aspergillus IgG antibodies is important in the diagnosis of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Immunoprecipitation techniques to detect these antibodies appear to lack sensitivity and accurate quantitation compared with enzyme immunoassays (EIA). This study assessed the performance of two commercial EIAs compared with counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE). This was a prospective cohort study of 175 adult patients with chronic or allergic pulmonary aspergillosis. Aspergillus IgG antibodies were detected using CIE, Phadia ImmunoCap Aspergillus IgG and Bio-Rad Platelia Aspergillus IgG. Inter-assay reproducibility was determined for each method and 25 patients had two serum samples analysed within a 6-month interval. When compared with CIE, both ImmunoCap and Platelia Aspergillus IgG had good sensitivity (97 and 93%, respectively) for detection of Aspergillus IgG antibodies. The level of agreement between the two EIAs for positive results was good, but the concentration of antibodies was not correlated between the tests or with CIE titre. ImmunoCap IgG inter-assay coefficient of variation was 5%, whereas Platelia IgG was 33%. Median ImmunoCap IgG values for CPA and allergic aspergillosis were 95 and 32 mg/L, respectively, whereas Platelia IgG values were >80 and 6 AU/mL. The direction of CIE titre change over 6 months was mirrored by ImmunoCap IgG levels in 92% of patients, and by Platelia IgG in 72% of patients. Both ImmunoCap and Platelia Aspergillus IgG EIAs are sensitive measures of Aspergillus IgG antibodies compared with CIE. However, ImmunoCap appears to have better reproducibility and may be more suitable for monitoring patient disease.",2013,23331929,no
Efficacy and safety of liposomal amphotericin B for deep mycosis in patients with connective tissue disease.,"The efficacy and safety of liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) in the treatment of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) were retrospectively evaluated for patients with connective tissue diseases (CTDs) during treatment with immunosuppressive therapy. Subjects were 13 patients with CTDs complicated by IFI, on the basis of clinical symptoms, imaging findings, and microbiological and histological examinations. All patients were treated with L-AMB. Efficacy and safety were evaluated before and after administration of L-AMB. Underlying diseases were systemic lupus erythematosus for 4 patients, rheumatoid arthritis for 3, microscopic polyangiitis for 2, adult-onset Still disease for 1, dermatomyositis for 1, and mixed connective tissue disease for 1. Eight patients were resistant to other antifungal drugs. Prednisolone was given to 11 patients and the median dose was 10 mg/day. Immunosuppressants were used for 8 patients. The median duration of administration of L-AMB was 8.5 days (range 4-38 days). In proven and probable diagnosis patients (n = 5), the treatment was effective for 3 patients and ineffective for 2 (efficacy rate 60 %).

Bayesian development of a dose-response model for Aspergillus fumigatus and invasive aspergillosis.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a major cause of mortality in immunocompromized hosts, most often consecutive to the inhalation of spores of Aspergillus. However, the relationship between Aspergillus concentration in the air and probability of IA is not quantitatively known. In this study, this relationship was examined in a murine model of IA. Immunosuppressed Balb/c mice were exposed for 60 minutes at day 0 to an aerosol of A. fumigatus spores (Af293 strain). At day 10, IA was assessed in mice by quantitative culture of the lungs and galactomannan dosage. Fifteen separate nebulizations with varying spore concentrations were performed. Rates of IA ranged from 0% to 100% according to spore concentrations. The dose-response relationship between probability of infection and spore exposure was approximated using the exponential model and the more flexible beta-Poisson model. Prior distributions of the parameters of the models were proposed then updated with data in a Bayesian framework. Both models yielded close median dose-responses of the posterior distributions for the main parameter of the model, but with different dispersions, either when the exposure dose was the concentration in the nebulized suspension or was the estimated quantity of spores inhaled by a mouse during the experiment. The median quantity of inhaled spores that infected 50% of mice was estimated at 1.8 × 10(4) and 3.2 × 10(4) viable spores in the exponential and beta-Poisson models, respectively. This study provides dose-response parameters for quantitative assessment of the relationship between airborne exposure to the reference A. fumigatus strain and probability of IA in immunocompromized hosts.

MIC values of voriconazole are predictive of treatment results in murine infections by Aspergillus terreus species complex.,"We evaluated the efficacy of voriconazole against nine strains of Aspergillus terreus with different MICs (0.12 to 4 μg/ml) by using a murine model. Markers of efficacy included survival, tissue burden, galactomannan antigenemia, and drug serum levels. Voriconazole was especially effective in prolonging survival and reducing the fungal load in infections by strains that showed MICs that were less than or equal to the epidemiological cutoff value (1 μg/ml).

Evaluation of the in vitro activity of voriconazole as predictive of in vivo outcome in a murine Aspergillus fumigatus infection model.,"We have evaluated the in vitro activity of voriconazole against 61 strains of Aspergillus fumigatus by using broth microdilution, disk diffusion, and minimal fungicidal concentration procedures. We observed an excellent correlation between the results obtained with the three methods. Five percent of the strains showed MICs greater than or equal to the epidemiological cutoff value (ECV 1 μg/ml). To assess whether MICs were predictive of in vivo outcome, we tested the efficacy of voriconazole at 25 mg/kg of body weight daily in an immunosuppressed murine model of disseminated infection using 10 strains representing various patterns of susceptibility to the drug as determined by the in vitro study. Voriconazole prolonged survival and reduced fungal load in the kidneys and brain in those mice infected with strains with MICs of ≤0.25 μg/ml, while in mice infected with strains with MICs of 0.5 to 2 μg/ml, the efficacy was varied and strain dependent and in mice infected with the strain with a MIC of 4 μg/ml, the antifungal did not show efficacy. Voriconazole reduced galactomannan antigenemia against practically all strains with a MIC of <4 μg/ml.

Up-date on diagnostic strategies of invasive aspergillosis.,"Invasive fungal infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunosuppressed patients with fatality rates ranging from 30 % to 80 % in neutropenic patients. This results at least partly in difficulties obtaining a reliable and early diagnosis, followed by the fact that clinical symptoms are unspecific and of very limited use. Conventional methods may be difficult and are often delayed. Serological tests like the galactomannan enzyme immunoassay are presently most promising for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis, however, sensitivity and specificity vary within the studies. This review reflects the current situation of diagnosing invasive fungal infections with a special focus on how to best diagnose Aspergillus-related infections (e.g., culture, microscopy, imaging techniques, CT-guided biopsies). Promising molecular techniques under development will be discussed and their potential for routine diagnostic applications (e.g. lateral flow device, polymerase chain reaction [PCR]-based assays, rolling circle amplification [RCA], loop-mediated amplification [LAMP], nucleic acid sequence-based amplification [NASBA]).

"A preliminary survey on the occurrence of mycotoxigenic fungi and mycotoxins contaminating red rice at consumer level in Selangor, Malaysia.","Red rice is a fermented product of Monascus spp. It is widely consumed by Malaysian Chinese who believe in its pharmacological properties. The traditional method of red rice preparation disregards safety regulation and renders red rice susceptible to fungal infestation and mycotoxin contamination. A preliminary study was undertaken aiming to determine the occurrence of mycotoxigenic fungi and mycotoxins contamination on red rice at consumer level in Selangor, Malaysia. Fifty red rice samples were obtained and subjected to fungal isolation, enumeration, and identification. Citrinin, aflatoxin, and ochratoxin-A were quantitated by ELISA based on the presence of predominant causal fungi. Fungal loads of 1.4 × 10(4) to 2.1 × 10(6) CFU/g exceeded Malaysian limits. Monascus spp. as starter fungi were present in 50 samples (100%), followed by Penicillium chrysogenum (62%), Aspergillus niger (54%), and Aspergillus flavus (44%). Citrinin was present in 100% samples (0.23-20.65 mg/kg), aflatoxin in 92% samples (0.61-77.33 μg/kg) and Ochratoxin-A in 100% samples (0.23-2.48 μg/kg) 100% citrinin and 76.09% aflatoxin exceeded Malaysian limits. The presence of mycotoxigenic fungi served as an indicator of mycotoxins contamination and might imply improper production, handling, transportation, and storage of red rice.

Key diagnostic considerations when evaluating a patient presenting with chronic inflammation of the CNS are discussed, and several specific infectious, neoplastic, and autoimmune etiologies are reviewed in detail.With recent advancement in serologic and CSF diagnostic testing, specific infectious, neoplastic, or autoimmune etiologies of chronic meningitis can be identified. Eliminating previous diagnostic uncertainty of chronic inflammation in the CNS has led to rapid and specific treatment regimens that ultimately improve patient outcomes. Recent advances in imaging have also aided clinicians in both their diagnostic approach and the detection of inflammatory complications such as hydrocephalus, hemorrhage, and ischemic stroke.Meningitis is defined as inflammation involving the meninges of the brain and spinal cord. Meningitis can be categorized as acute, subacute, or chronic based on duration of inflammation. This article focuses on the most common causes of subacute and chronic meningitis. Chronic meningitis is commonly defined as inflammation evolving during weeks to months without resolution of CSF abnormalities. Determining the time course of meningitis is important for creating a differential diagnosis. Most organisms causing acute meningitis rarely persist more than a few weeks. Although numerous etiologies of subacute and chronic meningitis have been identified, this article focuses on the most common etiologies: (1) infectious, (2) autoimmune, and (3) neoplastic.",2013,23221842,no
Diagnostic methods for invasive fungal diseases in patients with hematologic malignancies.,"Invasive fungal disease is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in hematologic malignancy patients and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Timely recognition and treatment of invasive fungal diseases in these patients are essential and decrease mortality. However, conventional definitive diagnostic methods are difficult and time consuming. While conventional microbiological and histopathological methods are still needed for a definitive diagnosis of invasive fungal disease, new noninvasive diagnostic methods including serologic and molecular biomarkers are now available. These new diagnostic methods facilitate an early diagnosis of invasive fungal disease and allow for utilization of a pre-emptive treatment approach, which may ultimately lead to improved treatment outcomes and reduced toxicity.",2013,23216596,no
Involvement of protein kinase C in the suppression of apoptosis and in polarity establishment in Aspergillus nidulans under conditions of heat stress.,"The pkcA gene, which encodes a protein kinase C (PKC) in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, is essential for its viability. However, little is known about its functions. To address this issue, we constructed and characterized temperature-sensitive mutants of pkcA. The conidia of these mutants swelled slightly and exhibited apoptotic phenotypes at 42°C. The apoptotic phenotypes were suppressed by an osmotic stabilizer. Under these conditions, the conidia swelled extensively and did not form germ tubes. Moreover, polarized distribution of F-actin was not observed. We then utilized deletion mutants of bckA, an ortholog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae bck1 that encodes a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase kinase and functions downstream of PKC in the cell wall integrity pathway. These mutants exhibited apoptotic phenotypes at 42°C, but they did not show defects in polarity establishment under osmotically stabilized conditions. These results suggest that PkcA plays multiple roles during germination under conditions of heat stress. The first of these roles is the suppression of apoptosis induction, while the other involves polarity establishment. The former depends on the MAP kinase cascade, whereas the latter does not. In addition, repolarization, which was observed after depolarization in the wild-type strain and the bckA deletion mutant under conditions of heat stress, was not observed in the pkcA-ts mutant. This suggests that PkcA also plays role in polarity establishment during hyphal growth independent of the MAP kinase cascade under these conditions.",2013,23209763,no
Have novel serum markers supplanted tissue diagnosis for invasive fungal infections in acute leukemia and transplantation?,"Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are difficult to diagnose, especially early in the course of infection when antifungal therapy is most effective. There are two commercially available biomarker assays useful for detection of the IFIs most commonly seen in patients with hematologic malignancies, the galactomannan and beta glucan assays. The former is specific for aspergillosis, the latter positive for not only Aspergillus and Candida species, but several other clinically relevant fungal pathogens as well. Both have good assay performance characteristics, provide rapid test results, are widely available, can be assayed non-invasively, and are positive early in the course of infection, often before onset of signs and symptoms of infection. Adoption of these assays into clinical practice has led to reduced need to perform invasive procedures to obtain deep tissue to establish the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections. Improved survival rates from aspergillosis are, in part, due to earlier detection of infection and earlier therapy.",2013,23200547,no
"[The importance of bronchoalveolar lavage sample for galactomannan, 1,3-ß-d-glucan and PCR tests].","Opportunistic fungal infections are life threatening especially for immunosuppressed patients. Early and accurate diagnosis is very important for the prompt initiation of treatment and to reduce unnecessary use of antifungal drugs. In recent years, efforts providing more rapid and more sensitive diagnosis of invasive fungal infections have been increasing. These methods include detection of fungal antigens, specific antibodies, fungal metabolites and DNA in the clinical samples. In this case, we report a seven year-old male patient with cystic fibrosis and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, who presented with fever, vomiting and chronic cough. Diffuse parenchymal infiltrations and alveolar opacities in the inferior lobe of right lung and focal patchy alveolar infiltrates in different segments in both lungs were seen in thoracal CT scanning. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample obtained by bronchoscopy was sent to the mycology laboratory and hypha elements that were compatible with Aspergillus were seen in direct examination. Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated from the culture of BAL sample. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (Rt-PCR), galactomannan (GM = 1.08 ng/ml) and 1,3-ß-D-Glucan (BG > 523 pg/ml) tests in BAL sample yielded positive results, however simultaneously performed PCR, GM (0.13 ng/ml) and BG (< 7 pg/ml) tests in serum sample were found to be negative. Treatment with voriconazole was started and continued for 45 days. The patient was discharged after improvement of his general state. It was concluded that PCR, GM and BG tests performed both in sera and BAL samples might aid to the early diagnosis and treatment of patients with invasive fungal infections in immunosuppressed patients. These data should be supported with further larger scale studies.",2014,23188584,no
Aspergillus meningitis: a rare clinical manifestation of central nervous system aspergillosis. Case report and review of 92 cases.,"To describe the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, cerebrospinal fluid findings and outcome of Aspergillus meningitis, meningoencephalitis and arachnoiditis.A case of Aspergillus meningitis is described. A comprehensive review of the English-language literature was conducted to identify all reported cases of Aspergillus meningitis described between January 1973 and December 2011.Ninety-three cases (including the one described herein) of Aspergillus meningitis were identified. Fifty-two (55.9%) were in individuals without any predisposing factor or known causes of immunosuppression. Acute and chronic meningitis was diagnosed in 65.6% of patients and meningoencephalitis in 24.7% of them with the remaining presenting with spinal arachnoiditis and ventriculitis. Cerebrospinal fluid cultures for Aspergillus spp. were positive in about 31% of cases and the galactomannan antigen test in 87%. Diagnosis during life was achieved in 52 patients (55.9%) with a case fatality rate of 50%. The overall case fatality rate was 72.1%.Aspergillus meningitis may occur in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients and run an acute or chronic course. The findings of this systematic review extend the information on this life-threatening infection and could assist physicians in achieving an improved outcome.",2013,23178421,no
"[Aspergillus serology, from yesterday to today for tomorrow].","Anti-Aspergillus antibody detection has been performed for over 50 years for the diagnosis of different chronic Aspergillus infections, starting with aspergilloma and later with chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis. It also enters into definition criteria for allergic broncho-pulmonary aspergillosis and contributes to the initial diagnosis of the aspergillosis, to the follow-up under treatment or to the detection of exacerbations. For the acute invasive aspergillosis, antibody detection has low interest compared to galactomannan antigen detection. Serology results have to be interpreted together with other clinical, radiological and biological, mycological criteria. This review describes the origins, the technical evolutions and the current place of Aspergillus serology in France. Finally, future improvements are discussed.",2014,23177817,no
Interlaboratory and interstudy reproducibility of a novel lateral-flow device and influence of antifungal therapy on detection of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.,"Interest in lateral-flow devices (LFDs) as potential point-of-care assays for the diagnosis of infectious diseases has increased. Our objective was to evaluate the interlaboratory and interstudy reproducibility and the effects of antifungal therapy on an LFD developed for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) detection. An established neutropenic guinea pig model of IPA caused by Aspergillus fumigatus was used. At predetermined time points (1 h and 3, 5, and 7 days postinoculation), blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were collected from infected and uninfected animals. In a separate experiment, guinea pigs were treated with posaconazole (10 mg/kg of body weight orally [p.o.] twice a day [BID]), voriconazole (10 mg/kg p.o. BID), liposomal amphotericin B (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally [i.p.] once a day [QD]), or caspofungin (2 mg/kg i.p. QD), and samples were collected on days 7 and 11. Each laboratory independently evaluated the IgG monoclonal antibody-based LFD. Galactomannan and (1 → 3)-β-D-glucan were also measured using commercially available kits. Good interlaboratory agreement was observed with the LFD, as the results for 97% (32/33) of the serum and 78.8% (26/33) of the BAL fluid samples from infected animals were in agreement. Good interstudy agreement was also observed. The serum sensitivity of each surrogate-marker assay was reduced in animals treated with antifungals. In contrast, these markers remained elevated within the BAL fluids of treated animals, which was consistent with the fungal burden and histopathology results. These results demonstrate that the LFD assay is reproducible between different laboratories and studies. However, the sensitivity of this assay and other markers of IPA may be reduced with serum in the presence of antifungal therapy.",2013,23175252,no
[Application of detecting bronchoalveolar lavage fluid Aspergillus galactomannan antigen in the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis].,"To prospectively evaluate the utility of detecting bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) Aspergillus galactomannan antigen (GM) in the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis.From August 2008 to April 2012, 121 patients suspected of pulmonary aspergillosis were recruited and classified into pulmonary aspergillosis group (n = 57) and non-pulmonary disease group (n = 64) according to the 2008 diagnostic criteria and classification of European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/National Institute of Mycoses Study Group(EORTC/MSG). The absorbency (A) and I value of GM in the patients' serum and BALF were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). And their values were compared and analyzed.Twenty cases were confirmed by pathological examinations and 37 cases by clinical diagnosis in the pulmonary aspergillosis group. The mean rank of GM's I value in the serum and BALF samples was 88.21 and 86.49. And they significantly increased compared with the non-pulmonary aspergillosis group (36.77, 38.30) (P < 0.01). At a different serum GM threshold I = 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, the sensitivities were 0.842, 0.649 and 0.228 the specificities 0.906, 0.938, 0.929The detection of GM in BALF may be employed for the clinical diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis.",2013,23158487,no
Bee venom at different concentrations modulates the aeroallergen-induced activation of nasal polyp epithelial cells.,"Bee venom (BV) has long been used as an oriental traditional medicine for the control of pain and inflammation. However, BV's anti-inflammatory mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to clarify the potential clinical efficacy of BV concerning the anti-inflammatory effect on nasal epithelial cell inflammation. Nasal polyp epithelial cells were obtained from patients. Cells were exposed to Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus nigra, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farina and lipopolysaccharide with or without various concentrations of BV. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor were measured to determine the activation of epithelial cells. Nuclear factor-ĸB (NF-ĸB) and activator protein 1 expression and activity were determined with Western blot analysis and ELISA. Cytotoxicity of BV was measured using a CellTiter-96® aqueous cell proliferation assay kit. Cell survival was significantly decreased at BV concentrations exceeding 5 µg/ml. Fungi-induced cytokine production was more effectively inhibited by BV than house dust mite. Alternaria enhanced NF-ĸB expression, which was strongly inhibited by BV. BV appears to be relatively safe, and is of potential value for the treatment of airway inflammation and/or immunologic diseases.",2013,23154617,no
The effect of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 deficiency on pulmonary allergic responses in Aspergillus fumigatus sensitized mice.,"Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2)/platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. A therapeutic targeting of this enzyme was challenged by the concern that increased circulating platelet activating factor (PAF) may predispose to or increase the severity of the allergic airway response. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Lp-PLA2 gene deficiency increases the risk of PAF and IgE-mediated inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo using mouse models.Lp-PLA2-/- mice were generated and back crossed to the C57BL/6 background. PAF-AH activity was measured using a hydrolysis assay in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples obtained from mice. Aspergillus fumigatus (Af)-specific serum was prepared for passive allergic sensitization of mice in vivo and mast cells in vitro. β- hexosaminidase release was studied in bone marrow derived mast cells sensitized with Af-specific serum or DNP-IgE and challenged with Af or DNP, respectively. Mice were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and PAF intratracheally and studied 24 hours later. Mice were sensitized either passively or actively against Af and were studied 48 hours after a single intranasal Af challenge. Airway responsiveness to methacholine, inflammatory cell influx in the lung tissue and BAL, immunoglobulin (ELISA) and cytokine (Luminex) profiles were compared between the wild type (WT) and Lp-PLA2-/- mice.PAF-AH activity was reduced but not completely abolished in Lp-PLA2-/- serum or by in vitro treatment of serum samples with a high saturating concentration of the selective Lp-PLA2 inhibitor, SB-435495. PAF inhalation significantly enhanced airway inflammation of LPS treated WT and Lp-PLA2-/- mice to a similar extent. Sensitized WT and Lp-PLA2-/- bone-marrow derived mast cells released β-hexosaminidase following stimulation by allergen or IgE crosslinking to equivalent levels. Wild type and Lp-PLA2-/- mice responded to passive or active allergic sensitization by significant IgE production, airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness after Af challenge. BAL cell influx was not different between these strains while IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and eotaxin release was attenuated in Lp-PLA2-/- mice. There were no differences in the amount of total IgE levels in the Af sensitized WT and Lp-PLA2-/- mice.We conclude that Lp-PLA2 deficiency in C57BL/6 mice did not result in a heightened airway inflammation or hyperresponsiveness after PAF/LPS treatment or passive or active allergic sensitization and challenge.",2013,23140447,no
Biosynthesis of the fungal cell wall polysaccharide galactomannan requires intraluminal GDP-mannose.,"Fungal cell walls frequently contain a polymer of mannose and galactose called galactomannan. In the pathogenic filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, this polysaccharide is made of a linear mannan backbone with side chains of galactofuran and is anchored to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol or is covalently linked to the cell wall. To date, the biosynthesis and significance of this polysaccharide are unknown. The present data demonstrate that deletion of the Golgi UDP-galactofuranose transporter GlfB or the GDP-mannose transporter GmtA leads to the absence of galactofuran or galactomannan, respectively. This indicates that the biosynthesis of galactomannan probably occurs in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus and thus contrasts with the biosynthesis of other fungal cell wall polysaccharides studied to date that takes place at the plasma membrane. Transglycosylation of galactomannan from the membrane to the cell wall is hypothesized because both the cell wall-bound and membrane-bound polysaccharide forms are affected in the generated mutants. Considering the severe growth defect of the A. fumigatus GmtA-deficient mutant, proving this paradigm might provide new targets for antifungal therapy.",2013,23139423,no

Specimens from 40 patients with hematologic malignancies were chosen for q-PCR and galactomannan (GM) test. The 28S rRNA, a real high consensus sequence of fungi, was selected as target gene to design primer and probe. The DNA of fungal species was extracted from serum specimens. The results showed that q-PCR sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 0.89, 0.85, 0.89, 0.85 respectively GM test sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 0.83, 0.80, 0.88, 0.73 respectively",2013,23114153,no
Epidemiology and treatment outcome of invasive fungal infections in patients with hematological malignancies.,"Invasive fungal infection (IFI) causes morbidity and mortality among patients with hematological malignancies who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

Occupational exposure to aflatoxin (AFB₁) in poultry production.,"Aflatoxin B₁ (AFB₁) has been recognized to produce cancer in human liver. In addition, epidemiological and laboratory studies demonstrated that the respiratory system was a target for AFB₁. Exposure occurs predominantly through the food chain, but inhalation represents an additional route of exposure. The present study aimed to examine AFB₁ exposure among poultry workers in Portugal. Blood samples were collected from a total of 31 poultry workers from six poultry farms. In addition, a control group (n = 30) was included comprised of workers who undertook administrative tasks. Measurement of AFB₁ in serum was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For examining fungi contamination, air samples were collected through an impaction method. Air sampling was obtained in pavilion interior and outside the premises, since this was the place regarded as the reference location. Using molecular methods, toxicogenic strains (aflatoxin-producing) were investigated within the group of species belonging to Aspergillus flavus complex. Eighteen poultry workers (59%) had detectable levels of AFB₁ with values ranging from <1 ng/ml to 4.23 ng/ml and with a mean value of 2 ± 0.98 ng/ml. AFB₁ was not detected in the serum sampled from any of the controls. Aspergillus flavus was the fungal species third most frequently found in the indoor air samples analyzed (7.2%) and was the most frequently isolated species in air samples containing only Aspergillus genus (74.5%). The presence of aflatoxigenic strains was only confirmed in outdoor air samples from one of the units, indicating the presence of a source inside the building in at least one case. Data indicate that AFB₁ inhalation represents an additional risk in this occupational setting that needs to be recognized, assessed, and prevented.",2013,23095151,no
"Invasive aspergillosis in patients with hematological malignancies in the Czech and Slovak republics: Fungal InfectioN Database (FIND) analysis, 2005-2009.","To evaluate risk factors, diagnostic procedures, and treatment outcomes of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in patients with hematological malignancies.A retrospective analysis of data from proven/probable IA cases that occurred from 2005 to 2009 at 10 hematology centers was performed.We identified 176 IA cases that mainly occurred in patients with acute leukemias (58.5%), mostly those on induction/re-induction treatments (39.8%). Prolonged neutropenia was the most frequent risk factor for IA (61.4%). The lungs were the most frequently affected site (93.8%) and computed tomography detected abnormalities in all episodes however, only 53.7% of patients had findings suggestive of IA. Galactomannan (GM) detection in serum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (positive in 79.1% and 78.8% of episodes, respectively) played a crucial role in IA diagnosis. Neutrophil count and antifungal prophylaxis did not influence the GM positivity rate, but empirical therapy decreased this rate (in serum). Of the IA cases, 53.2% responded to initial antifungal therapy. The combination of voriconazole and echinocandin, even as initial or salvage therapy, did not perform better than voriconazole monotherapy (p=0.924 for initial therapy and p=0.205 for salvage therapy). Neutrophil recovery had a significant role in the response to initial (but not salvage) antifungal therapy.Our retrospective analysis identified key diagnostic and treatment characteristics, and this understanding could improve the management of hematological malignancy patients with IA.",2013,23084969,no
Molecular techniques in the diagnosis of deep and systemic mycosis.,"Making an early and sensitive diagnosis of invasive fungal infections in high-risk patients is mandatory, because it has major consequences on the effectiveness of antifungal therapy. Molecular assays have the potential to become the cornerstone of diagnosis, allowing for rapid, reliable detection of minute amounts of fungal DNA in various specimens at a low cost. PCR is gaining popularity as the platforms become more automated and commercially available however, further studies are needed to explore the diagnostic value in patient subgroups (ie, children) and to define whether the underlying disease or the use of antifungal prophylaxis may influence assay results. Individualized management of high-risk patients would be desirable to integrate preemptive therapy strategies, and individual host and genetic factors.

"ManR, a novel Zn(II)2Cys6 transcriptional activator, controls the β-mannan utilization system in Aspergillus oryzae.","Fungal endo-β-mannanases (β-mannanases) are widely used as industrial enzymes however, no transcriptional regulator of β-mannanases has been identified in fungi or other eukaryotic cells to date. To identify a transcriptional regulator of β-mannanases in Aspergillus oryzae, a gene-disruptant library of transcriptional regulators was screened for mutants exhibiting reduced β-mannanase activity by using konjac glucomannan as the substrate, and ManR, a Zn(II)(2)Cys(6) type DNA binding protein was identified. Moreover, a manR-overexpressing strain showed significantly increased β-mannanase activity. DNA microarray analysis of the manR-disruptant strain further indicated that when konjac glucomannan is used as the carbon source, ManR positively regulates the gene expression of not only β-mannanase, but also the enzymes involved in the degradation of galactomannans and glucomannans such as α-galactosidase, β-mannosidase, acetylmannan esterase, and β-glucosidase. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the presence of 1,4-β-d-mannobiose increased the expression of the endo-β-mannanase gene (manG, AO090010000122), and that ManR plays a key role in the inducible expression of manG in A. oryzae. Therefore, we conclude that ManR is a positive regulator of the β-mannan utilization system in A. oryzae. This is the first study to identify a transcriptional regulator of this system in eukaryotic cells.",2013,23063954,no
Cytokine milieu in renal cavities of immunocompetent mice in response to intravenous challenge of Aspergillus flavus leading to aspergillosis.,"Investigations in mice have demonstrated that Aspergillus flavus is more virulent than all other Aspergillus species except A. tamari. However, there is a complete lack of information on the immune responses elicited by A. flavus in systemic model. This communication reports the progression of infection and cytokine profile in BALB/c mice in response to intravenous challenge of A. flavus. The pathogenesis of infection was evaluated morphologically and by the analysis of Colony Forming Units (CFUs) in kidney homogenates. The kinetics of regulated cytokines was determined in kidneys by cytokine-specific murine ELISA. During the initial phase of infection the rate of clearance of A. flavus was high, most likely through recruited neutrophils and the resident renal macrophages with concurrent significant release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-12/IL-23p40, IL-6) indicating antifungal innate immune response to be active at the site. However, at 24h PI there was a significant rise of IL-17 and IL-23 suggesting the activation of IL-17/IL-23 axis of inflammation resulting in rise of CFU. The lack of significant induction in the anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-4 and IL-10 confirmed the absence of Th2 type of response. In the late phase, after 3days post-infection, there was a rise in the number of pathogen in the kidneys as determined by histopathology and CFU counts. The A. flavus hyphae were evident in the renal pelvis and ureter and we propose the production of blastoconidia by metamorphosed hyphae.",2013,23063795,no
Onychomycosis: modern diagnostic and treatment approaches.,"The medical term onychomycosis should be understood as chronic infection of the nails caused by a fungus. The most common causative agents are the dermatophytes and Candida species. The less common are certain types of moulds (nondermatophyte moulds or NDMs). In approximately 60-80 % of the cases, onychomycosis is due to dermatophytes. Among dermatophytes, the most often isolated causative pathogen is Trichophyton (T.) rubrum. Other common species are T. interdigitale (formerly T. mentagrophytes), Epidermophyton floccosum, and T. tonsurans. The most significant yeasts causing onychomycosis are Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis. Predisposing factors for onychomycosis include mainly diseases such as diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular arterial disease, chronic venous insufficiency, polyneuropathies of diverse etiologies, and immunosuppression, e.g., myeloproliferative diseases (such as lymphoma and paraproteinemia), HIV/AIDS, etc. Other factors facilitating the fungal infection are frequent trauma in professional sportsmen, often accompanied by excessive perspiration. The diagnostic methods that are often applied in different dermatologic departments and ambulatory units are also different. This precludes the creation of a unified diagnostic algorithm that could be used everywhere as a possible standard. In most of the cases, the method of choice depends on the specialist's individual experience. The therapeutic approach depends mostly on the fungal organism identified by the dermatologist or mycologist. This review hereby includes the conventional as well as the newest and most reliable and modern methods used for the identification of the pathogens causing onychomycosis. Moreover, detailed information is suggested, about the choice of therapeutic scheme in case whether dermatophytes, moulds, or yeasts have been identified as causative agents. A thorough discussion of the schemes and duration of the antifungal therapy in certain groups of patients have been included.",2013,23053563,no
Aspergillus galactomannan antigen assay and invasive aspergillosis in pediatric cancer patients and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised children.

Evaluation of serum galactomannan detection for diagnosis of feline upper respiratory tract aspergillosis.,"Measurement of serum galactomannan (GM), a polysaccharide fungal cell-wall component, is a non-invasive test for early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in humans. Feline upper respiratory tract (URT) aspergillosis is an emerging infectious disease in cats. Diagnosis requires biopsy for procurement of tissue specimens for cytological or histological detection of fungal hyphae and for fungal culture. The aim of this study was to evaluate serum GM measurement as a non-invasive diagnostic test for URT aspergillosis in cats. A one-stage, immunoenzymatic sandwich ELISA was used to detect serum GM in 4 groups of cats Group 1 (URT aspergillosis) - confirmed URT aspergillosis (n=13, sinonasal aspergillosis (SNA) n=6 and sino-orbital aspergillosis (SOA) n=7), Group 2 (URT other) - other URT diseases (n=15), Group 3 (β-lactam) - cats treated with β-lactam antibiotics for non-respiratory tract disease (n=14), Group 4a - healthy young cats (≤ 1 y of age, n=28), Group 4b - healthy adult cats (>1 y of age, n=16). One cat with SNA and two cats with SOA caused by an Aspergillus fumigatus-mimetic species, tested positive for serum GM. For a cut-off optical density index of 1.5, the overall sensitivity and specificity of the assay was 23% and 78% respectively. False positive results occurred in 29% of cats in Group 3 and 32% of cats in Group 4a. Specificity increased to 90% when Groups 3 and 4a were excluded from the analysis. Overall, serum GM measurement has a poor sensitivity but is a moderately specific, non-invasive screening test to rule out infection in patients with suspected feline upper respiratory tract aspergillosis.",2014,23031342,no
Detection of biofilm-grown Aspergillus fumigatus by means of atomic force spectroscopy: ultrastructural effects of alginate lyase.,"Aspergillus fumigatus has become a leading cause of fungal morbidity and mortality, especially in immunocompromised patients. This fungus is able to grow as a multicellular community and produce a hydrophobic extracellular matrix (ECM), mainly composed of galactomannan and α-1,3 glucans, to protect itself from host defenses and antimicrobial drugs. This matrix envelops the fungus hyphae, binding them into a contiguous sheath on the colony surface, forming a biofilm and increasing the fungal resistance to adverse environmental factors. Adherence to host cells and resistance to physical removal play a key role in fungal colonization and invasion of the host and in a wide range of infections. Here we show that, by using atomic force spectroscopy, it is possible to exploit the peculiar hydrophobicity of the biofilm components (i.e., cell walls, ECM) to detect the biofilm spread, its growth, and lysis on rough surfaces. By means of this approach, we demonstrate that alginate lyase, an enzyme known to reduce negatively charged alginate levels in microbial biofilms, reduces the biofilm adhesion forces suggesting a loss of ECM from the biofilm, which could be used to enhance pharmacological treatments.",2013,23026204,no
Occurrence of household mold and efficacy of sodium hypochlorite disinfectant.,"The occurrence and distribution of mold on household surfaces and the efficacy of bleach-based (sodium hypochlorite, NaOCl) disinfectants on mold viability and allergenicity was documented. Household microenvironments prone to increased moisture were specifically targeted. Using the sticky tape method, 1330 samples were collected from non-porous indoor surfaces of 160 homes across the United States, and analyzed for mold. Homes were randomly selected and recruited via phone interviews. Culture and immunoassays were used to measure the viability and reduction of allergenic properties of Aspergillus fumigatus following 2.4% NaOCl treatment. All homes and 72.9% of surfaces tested positive for mold. Windowsills were the most frequently contaminated site (87.5%) and Cladosporium the most commonly identified mold (31.0%). Five-minute exposures to 2.4% NaOCl resulted in a >3 to >6-log₁₀ reduction of culturable mold counts in controlled laboratory studies. Organisms were nonculturable after 5- and 10-min contact times on non-porous and porous ceramic carriers, respectively, and A. fumigatus spore-eluted allergen levels were reduced by an average 95.8% in 30 sec, as indicated by immunoassay. All homes are contaminated with some level of mold, and regrowth is likely in moisture-prone microenvironments. The use of low concentrations (2.4%) of NaOCl for the reduction of culturable indoor mold and related allergens is effective and recommended.",2013,23016564,no
Effect of PTX3 and voriconazole combination in a rat model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.,"This study evaluated the pharmacological activity of PTX3, administered in combination with voriconazole, in a rat model of pulmonary aspergillosis. The data indicated additive therapeutic activities of these compounds, as demonstrated by the amelioration of respiratory function changes, reduction of lung fungal burden, and increased survival. Overall, we provide clear evidence that the combination of PTX3 with a suboptimal dose of voriconazole might represent a therapeutic option under those clinical conditions where the use of voriconazole alone is not warranted for efficacy and tolerability reasons.",2013,23006752,no
Clinical utility of fungal screening assays in adults with severe burns.,"Fungal wound infection is a leading cause of burn wound infections, and diagnosis is often delayed as it conventionally requires culture and histopathology. Fungal screening assays have sped diagnosis of invasive fungal infections in other populations. Few studies have evaluated the performance of fungal screening assays outside of the hematologic malignancy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant populations.We performed a three year retrospective analysis of all fungal screening assays in burn patients in the ICU between 2008 and 2011. The primary goal was to evaluate the correlation between the two available fungal screening assays, (1→3)-β-d-glucan (BG) and galactomannan (GM) assay, and fungal wound colonization (FWC) and infection (FWI). We also evaluated previously hypothesized causes of false positives and their associations with false positives in the burn population.We identified 53 patients [median 29% total body surface area burned (TBSA), IQR 17-51] with BG or GM serological tests available, of which 15 had a FWI or FWC. FWC/FWI was associated with higher TBSA (p=0.02). BG and GM correlated with TBSA (BG 0.57, p<0.01 GM 0.35, p=0.02), but neither assay was associated with FWI/FWC or species of fungus involved when FWI/FWC was diagnosed.Positive BG and GM fungal screening assays are not associated with FWI/FWC, or with species of fungus when FWC/FWI is present. BG false positives are common and associated with higher TBSA burns.",2013,22999208,no
Development and application of mold antigen-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) to quantify airborne antigen exposure.,"The aim of our study was to develop specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and apply these to assess mold antigen exposure in composting plants. Sandwich ELISAs based on polyclonal antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus (Af), Penicillium chrysogenum (Pc), and Cladosporium herbarum (Ch) antigens were developed and validated. Reactivity to 18 different mold species was tested. To optimize extraction procedure, inhalable dust samples taken by a parallel sampler were extracted with or without homogenization. In 31 composting plants stationary pumps were installed at 4 sites to collect 124 inhalable dust samples. The newly developed ELISAs were used in addition to an anti β-1,3-glucan ELISA to quantify mold antigens. The Cladosporium ELISA showed less than 0.04% reactivity to extracts from other fungal genera, while the Af ELISA demonstrated a reactivity of up to 3.6% and the Pc ELISA reacted up to 11% to other mold species. Extraction of parallel sampled filters gave higher antigen amounts with homogenization. The increase was highest for Pc-antigens, followed by Af-antigens, and lowest for Ch-antigens. Mean lower detection limits of homogenized inhalable dust samples were 5 ng/m(3) (Af), 0.6 ng/m(3) (Pc), 0.2 ng/m(3) (Ch), and 0.6 ng/m(3) (β-1,3-glucan). The ELISAs were able to detect antigens in 43% (Af), 37% (Pc), 94% (Ch), or 100% (β-1,3-glucan) of the 124 airborne dust samples. Inhalable dust, β-1,3-glucan, and Af-, Pc-, and Ch-antigen concentrations were significantly correlated. The newly developed mold antigen ELISAs are thus able to measure airborne exposure levels in composting plants and differentiate between distinct fungi genera.",2012,22994572,no
"Alpha-momorcharin, a RIP produced by bitter melon, enhances defense response in tobacco plants against diverse plant viruses and shows antifungal activity in vitro.","Alpha-momorcharin (α-MMC) is type-1 ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs) with molecular weight of 29 kDa and has lots of biological activity. Our recent study indicated that the α-MMC purified from seeds of Momordica charantia exhibited distinct antiviral and antifungal activity. Tobacco plants pre-treated with 0.5 mg/mL α-MMC 3 days before inoculation with various viruses showed less-severe symptom and less reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation compared to that inoculated with viruses only. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that the replication levels of viruses were lower in the plants treated with the α-MMC than control plants at 15 days post inoculation. Moreover, the coat protein expression of viruses was almost completely inhibited in plants which were treated with the α-MMC compared with control plants. Furthermore, the SA-responsive defense-related genes including non-expressor of pathogenesis-related genes 1 (NPR1), PR1, PR2 were up-regulated and activities of some antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) were increased after the α-MMC treatment. In addition, the α-MMC (500 μg/mL) revealed remarkable antifungal effect against phytopathogenic fungi, in the growth inhibition range 50.35-67.21 %, along with their MIC values ranging from 100 to 500 μg/mL. The α-MMC had also a strong detrimental effect on spore germination of all the tested plant pathogens along with concentration as well as time-dependent kinetic inhibition of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. The α-MMC showed a remarkable antiviral and antifungal effect and hence could possibly be exploited in crop protection for controlling certain important plant diseases.",2013,22983699,no
Invasive fungal infection in chronic granulomatous disease:  insights into pathogenesis and management.,"Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) remain a major cause of death in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). We discuss the new insights into the pathogenesis, diagnosis, prevention, and management of invasive fungal infections in patients with CGD.CGD has the highest prevalence of IFIs among the immunodeficiencies. Infections typically involve the lung, and the most commonly isolated pathogen is Aspergillus spp. However, IFIs due to rare opportunistic filamentous fungi are increasingly reported. Most IFIs are diagnosed on routine chest imaging, and serum markers such as galactomannan and 1,3-β-D-glucan are of limited value in CGD. Routine use of itraconazole for prophylaxis continues to be recommended, although posaconazole may be an alternative. Management of IFIs is typically centered on prolonged courses of antifungal therapy. Surgery may be required for complete resolution, especially in the setting of osteomyelitis or infections due to Aspergillus nidulans or other poorly responsive molds. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) cures CGD and may be appropriate in select patients with refractory IFIs.Management of IFIs in CGD has significantly improved over the last decade. Earlier diagnosis of IFIs, accurate identification of pathogens, and development of reliable susceptibility testing are areas for future emphasis. HSCT is a promising therapy, even during refractory infections in CGD.",2013,22964947,no
Diagnostic accuracy of PCR alone compared to galactomannan in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis: a systematic review.,"PCR in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid has not been accepted as a diagnostic criterion for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). We conducted a systematic review assessing the diagnostic accuracy of PCR in BAL fluid with a direct comparison versus galactomannan (GM) in BAL fluid. We included prospective and retrospective cohort and case-control studies. Studies were included if they used the EORTC/MSG consensus definition criteria of IPA and assessed ≥80% of patients at risk for IPA. Two reviewers abstracted data independently. Risk of bias was assessed using QUADAS-2. Summary sensitivity and specificity values were estimated using a bivariate model and reported with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Nineteen studies published between 1993 and 2012 were included. The summary sensitivity and specificity values (CIs) for diagnosis of proven or probable IPA were 90.2% (77.2 to 96.1%) and 96.4% (93.3 to 98.1%), respectively. In nine cohort studies strictly adherent to the 2002 or 2008 EORTC/MSG criteria for reference standard definitions, the summary sensitivity and specificity values (CIs) were 77.2% (62 to 87.6%) and 93.5% (90.6 to 95.6%), respectively. Antifungal treatment before bronchoscopy significantly reduced sensitivity. The diagnostic performance of PCR was similar to that of GM in BAL fluid using an optical density index cutoff of 0.5. If either PCR or GM in BAL fluid defined a positive result, the pooled sensitivity was higher than that of GM alone, with similar specificity. We conclude that the diagnostic performance of PCR in BAL fluid is good and comparable to that of GM in BAL fluid. Performing both tests results in optimal sensitivity with no loss of specificity. Results are dependent on the reference standard definitions.",2013,22952268,no
Diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in children with bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan.,"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a life-threatening complication in immunocompromised patients. Early diagnosis and therapy improves outcome. Assessment of galactomannan (GM) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid is a proposed tool to diagnose IPA. Little is known about the diagnostic value of BAL GM in children.Retrospectively, 72 bronchoscopies were analyzed for GM in patients fulfilling the host factor criteria as defined by the EORTC/MSG. A cut-off index value GM of ≥0.5 was used. Clinical data, results of chest CT-scans and BAL cultures were collected.Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of BAL GM for a diagnosis of proven and probable IPA (n = 41) were 82.4%, 87.5%, 82.4%, and 87.5% respectively. A significant relation was found for BAL GM and abnormal chest CT (P = 0.01). No significant relationship was observed between BAL Aspergillus sp. culture and chest CT (n = 47). BAL GM and serum GM correlated significantly. In 9 out of 12 patients classified as possible IPA, antifungal therapy was continued or started, despite a negative BAL GM.BAL GM test had good diagnostic value in children suspected of IPA. However, the decision to continue or start antifungal therapy was mainly determined by the clinical suspicion of IPA based on chest CT-outcome, serum GM index values and failure of antibiotic therapy.",2014,22949309,yes
Fungal α-arabinofuranosidases of glycosyl hydrolase families 51 and 54 show a dual arabinofuranosyl- and galactofuranosyl-hydrolyzing activity.,"Aspergillus niger possesses a galactofuranosidase activity, however, the corresponding enzyme or gene encoding this enzyme has never been identified. As evidence is mounting that enzymes exist with affinity for both arabinofuranose and galactofuranose, we investigated the possibility that α-L-arabinofuranosidases, encoded by the abfA and abfB genes, are responsible for the galactofuranosidase activity of A. niger. Characterization of the recombinant AbfA and AbfB proteins revealed that both enzymes do not only hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl-α-L-arabinofuranoside (pNp-α-Araf) but are also capable of hydrolyzing p-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactofuranoside (pNp-β-Galf). Molecular modeling of the AbfB protein with pNp-β-Galf confirmed the possibility for AbfB to interact with this substrate, similarly as with pNp-α-Araf. We also show that galactomannan, a cell wall compound of A. niger, containing β-linked terminal and internal galactofuranosyl moieties, can be degraded by an enzyme activity that is present in the supernatant of inulin-grown A. niger. Interestingly, purified AbfA and AbfB did not show this hydrolyzing activity toward A. nigergalactomannan. In summary, our studies demonstrate that AbfA and AbfB, α-L-arabinofuranosidases from different families, both contain a galactofuranose (Galf)-hydrolyzing activity. In addition, our data support the presence of a Galf-hydrolase activity expressed by A. niger that is capable of degrading fungal galactomannan.",2013,22944679,no
(1-3)-β-D-Glucan vs Galactomannan Antigen in Diagnosing Invasive Fungal Infections (IFIs).,"Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are serious and often life-threatening complications in patients with haematological malignancies. Early diagnosis and the initiation of efficacious antifungal treatments could affect the prognosis of these patients. The detection of (1-3)-β-D-Glucan (BDG) could be a promising non-culture-based, noninvasive tool for IFI analyses in haemato-oncological patients, allowing the diagnosis of the two major IFIs, invasive aspergillosis (IA) and invasive candidiasis (IC), with a single test. The aim of this work was to evaluate and compare the use of the BDG in combination with the galactomannan antigen (GAL) assay in order to exclude or confirm suspected IFIs. Sera from 46 haemato-oncological patients (24 with proven/probable IFI and 22 without IFI symptoms) were evaluated retrospectively for the detection of GAL and BDG. In 24 patients, the serum BDG levels facilitated IFI diagnosis: 18 probable IA, 3 proven IA and 3 IC. In the remaining 22 patients, the BDG level helped exclude IFIs. The BDG was positive earlier than GAL in 5/24 cases [three of probable invasive aspergillosis (IA), one of proven IA and one case of proven invasive candidiasis (IC)] and was positive at the same time as GAL in 19/24 cases in no case was GAL positive before BDG was. The BDG detection is useful, however, the test has a great limitation because it is a completely manual procedure.",2012,22942923,no
Nucleotide oligomerization domain 2 contributes to the innate immune response in THCE cells stimulated by Aspergillus fumigatus conidia.,"To investigate the expression of nucleotide oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) in the immortalized human corneal epithelial cell line (THCE), and its role in the innate immune response triggered by inactive Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) conidia.The normal THCE cells were investigated as controls. After incubation with inactive Af conidia for 0.5, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours, THCE cells were harvested, mRNA expression of NOD2 and receptor interacting protein 2 (RIP2) was detected by RT-PCR. Intracellular proteins including NOD2, NF-κB and proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-8, IL-6 in the cell supernatant were analyzed by ELISA.Our data indicate that NOD2 expressed in the normal THCE cells. After triggered by the inactive Af conidia, the expression of NOD2, RIP2 mRNA and the secretion of NOD2, NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-8, IL-6 both increased in a time-depended manner, and reached the peak point at 4, 6, 6, 4, 6, 6, 4 hours, respectively. And after pretreated with NOD2 neutralizing antibody, the expression of RIP2, NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-8 both decreased dramatically at the peak point, while the secretion of IL-6 changed little.The results of this study suggest that NOD2 exists and expresses in the THCE cells, and contributes to the innate immune responses triggered by inactive Af conidia by induction of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-8 through the NF-κB pathway.",2012,22937496,no
[Effects of chronic Aspergillus fumigatus exposure on the expression of mucin 5AC in the airways of asthmatic rats].,"To explore the effects of chronic Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) exposure on the expression of mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) in the airways of asthmatic rats.Fifty-six male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 8 groups: chronic asthma (group A), chronic asthma plus Af spores inhalation for 1 week (group B), 3 weeks (group C) and 5 weeks (group D), chronic asthma plus saline inhalation for 5 weeks (group E), OVA-sensitized and-saline-challenged group (group F) and OVA-sensitized and-saline-challenged plus Af spores inhalation for 5 weeks (group G) (each n = 8). The airway resistance (Raw) and the change rate of Raw after acetylcholine provocation were detected using a computerized system. The level of MUC5AC mRNA in the lung tissue was measured by RT-PCR, and the expression of MUC5AC in airway epithelial cells were demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. The concentration of IL-13 in BALF was measured by ELISA. The extent of goblet cell hyperplasia was evaluated on periodic acid-Schiff stain (PAS) lung sections.In group B, C, and D, the level of MUC5AC mRNA (MUC5AC mRNA/β-actin mRNA) (1.9 ± 0.4, 2.3 ± 0.6, 2.9 ± 0.8, respectively), the integrated optical density (value A) of MUC5AC positive stain in airway epithelial cells (278 ± 58, 566 ± 64, 891 ± 80, respectively), the concentration of IL-13 in BALF (µg/L) (96 ± 16, 136 ± 22, 197 ± 34, respectively), and the ratio of goblet cell area to epithelial cell area(%) (16 ± 5, 23 ± 7, 36 ± 9, respectively), were higher than those in group A, E, F and G (all P < 0.05). The change rate of Raw(%) in group C and D (61.91 ± 5.26 and 84.69 ± 6.38) were higher than that in group A, E, F and G (all P < 0.05). The level of MUC5AC mRNA and the value A of MUC5AC were positively correlated with the ratio of goblet cell area to epithelial cell area (r = 0.578, P < 0.05r = 0.614, P < 0.05, respectively) and the change rate of Raw (r = 0.638, P < 0.05Chronic Aspergillus fumigatus exposure upregulated the expression of MUC5AC in the airway epithelial cells and induced goblet cell hyperplasia, resulting in increased airway hypersensitivity in rats with chronic asthma.",2013,22931723,no
Staphylococcus aureus adherence to Candida albicans hyphae is mediated by the hyphal adhesin Als3p.,"The bacterium Staphylococcus (St.) aureus and the opportunistic fungus Candida albicans are currently among the leading nosocomial pathogens, often co-infecting critically ill patients, with high morbidity and mortality. Previous investigations have demonstrated preferential adherence of St. aureus to C. albicans hyphae during mixed biofilm growth. In this study, we aimed to characterize the mechanism behind this observed interaction. C. albicans adhesin-deficient mutant strains were screened by microscopy to identify the specific receptor on C. albicans hyphae recognized by St. aureus. Furthermore, an immunoassay was developed to validate and quantify staphylococcal binding to fungal biofilms. The findings from these experiments implicated the C. albicans adhesin agglutinin-like sequence 3 (Als3p) in playing a major role in the adherence process. This association was quantitatively established using atomic force microscopy, in which the adhesion force between single cells of the two species was significantly reduced for a C. albicans mutant strain lacking als3. Confocal microscopy further confirmed these observations, as St. aureus overlaid with a purified recombinant Als3 N-terminal domain fragment (rAls3p) exhibited robust binding. Importantly, a strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae heterologously expressing Als3p was utilized to further confirm this adhesin as a receptor for St. aureus. Although the parental strain does not bind bacteria, expression of Als3p on the cell surface conferred upon the yeast the ability to strongly bind St. aureus. To elucidate the implications of these in vitro findings in a clinically relevant setting, an ex vivo murine model of co-infection was designed using murine tongue explants. Fluorescent microscopic images revealed extensive hyphal penetration of the epithelium typical of C. albicans mucosal infection. Interestingly, St. aureus bacterial cells were only seen within the epithelial tissue when associated with the invasive hyphae. This differed from tongues infected with St. aureus alone or in conjunction with the als3 mutant strain of C. albicans, where bacterial presence was limited to the outer layers of the oral tissue. Collectively, the findings generated from this study identified a key role for C. albicans Als3p in mediating this clinically relevant fungal-bacterial interaction.",2013,22918893,no
Systematic review and meta-analysis of detecting galactomannan in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis.,"Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) galactomannan (GM) assay has been used for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis (IA). We aimed to derive a definitive estimate of the overall accuracy of BAL-GM for diagnosing IA.We undertook a systematic review of thirty diagnostic studies that evaluated the BAL-GM assay for diagnosing IA. PubMed and CBM (China Biological Medicine Database) databases were searched for relevant studies published in all languages up until Feb 2012. The pooled diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) were constructed for each cutoff value. Additionally, pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), and positive and negative likelihood ratios (PLR and NLR, respectively) were calculated for summarizing overall test performance. Thirty studies were included in this meta-analysis. The summary estimates of pooled DOR, SEN, SPE, PLR, and NLR of the BAL-GM assay (cutoff value 0.5) for proven or probable IA were 52.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) 31.8-87.3), 0.87 (95% CI 0.79-0.92), 0.89 (95% CI 0.85-0.92), 8.0 (95% CI 5.7-11.1) and 0.15 (95% CI 0.10-0.23) respectively. The SROC was 0.94 (95% CI 0.92-0.96). Compared with cutoff value of 0.5, it has higher DOR, SPE and PLR, and similar SEN and NLR with cutoff value of 1.0, which indicated the optimal cutoff value might be 1.0. Compared with BAL-GM, serum GM has a lower SEN and higher SPE, while PCR displays a lower SEN and a similar SPE.With the optimal cutoff value of 1.0, the BAL-GM assay has higher SEN compared to PCR and serum GM test. It is a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of proven and probable IA.",2013,22905261,no
The effect of Aspergillus fumigatus infection on vitamin D receptor expression in cystic fibrosis.,"Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) in cystic fibrosis (CF) is increasingly recognized. Although allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) leads to deterioration of pulmonary function, the effect of A. fumigatus colonization in the absence of ABPA remains unclear.To address this, we examined individuals with CF with A. fumigatus who were ABPA negative to identify the effects of itraconazole therapy on Aspergillus-induced lung inflammation.The effect of A. fumigatus on nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression was investigated using qRT-PCR and Western blotting. IL-5 and IL-13 levels were quantified by ELISA. The effect of itraconazole was assessed by a combination of high-resolution computed tomography, lung function test, and microbiological analysis.We demonstrate that A. fumigatus down-regulates VDR in macrophages and airway epithelial cells and that the fungal metabolite gliotoxin (Gt) is the main causative agent. Gt overcame the positive effect of 1,25-OH vitamin D(3) on VDR expression in vitro, resulting in increased IL-5 and IL-13 production. In vivo, A. fumigatus positivity was associated with increased Gt in CF bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels of IL-5 and IL-13. After airway eradication of A. fumigatus with itraconazole, we observed decreased Gt, IL-5 and IL-13, improved respiratory symptoms, and diminished high-resolution computed tomography mosaic pattern consistent with sustained pulmonary function.This study provides a rationale for the therapeutic effect of itraconazole and implied that the therapeutic potential of vitamin D supplementation in preventing ABPA is only feasible with concurrent elimination of A. fumigatus to permit VDR expression and its positive functional consequences.",2013,22904183,no
Structural requirements for the activity of the MirB ferrisiderophore transporter of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Siderophores have been identified as virulence factors in the opportunistic fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. The 14-pass transmembrane protein MirB is postulated to function as a siderophore transporter, responsible for uptake of the hydroxamate siderophore N,N',N″-triacetylfusarinine C (TAFC). Our aim was to identify amino acids of A. fumigatus MirB that are crucial for uptake of TAFC. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to create MirB mutants. Expression of wild-type and mutant proteins in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain PHY14, which lacks endogenous siderophore transporters, was confirmed by Western blotting. TAFC transport assays using (55)Fe-labeled TAFC and growth assays with Fe-TAFC as the sole iron source identified alanine 125, tyrosine 577, loop 3, and the second half of loop 7 (Loop7Del2) as crucial for function, since their substitution or deletion abrogated uptake completely. Wild-type MirB transported ferricrocin and coprogen as well as TAFC but not ferrichrysin. MirB was localized by fluorescence microscopy using antisera raised against a MirB extracellular loop peptide. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that in yeast, wild-type MirB had a punctate distribution under the plasma membrane, as did the A125D and Y577A strains, indicating that the defect in transport of these mutants was unlikely to be due to mislocalization or degradation. MirB immunolocalization in A. fumigatus showed that the transporter was found in vesicles which cycled between the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane and was concentrated at the hyphal tips. The location of MirB was not influenced by the presence of the siderophore TAFC but was sensitive to internal iron stores.",2013,22903978,no
State of the art diagnostic of mold diseases: a practical guide for clinicians.,"The epidemiology of fungal diseases changed, and molds have been increasingly associated with high mortality in severe immunocompromised patients. Invasive mold diseases may originate from the airborne conidia through inhalation or inoculation in skin fissures associated with indwelling catheters, wounds, burns, or onychomycosis. The diagnosis and treatment of fungal diseases is problematic and raises considerable challenges. Diagnosis of invasive mold diseases includes several methodologies, of which the most commonly used are the cultural methods, antigen testing, nucleic acid detection, and radiological imaging. Galactomannan and (1 → 3)-β-D-glucan detection significantly improved mold diagnosis in the last decade. Several molecular strategies have been proposed over the years but no consensus was achieved for standardized protocols or cut-off values. Recently, the first commercially available molecular assay for detection of Aspergillus was tested and the results were highly reproducible. In addition, blood cultures may also be helpful for invasive aspergillosis by following a novel procedure for the recovery of Aspergillus spp. from blood cultures. The association of distinct diagnostic methods, particularly molecular tests, galactomannan, and/or (1 → 3)-β-D-glucan detection, may provide earlier and more sensitive diagnosis of mold diseases and be indicative for early antifungal treatment. Accurate routine use of diagnostic tests can be cost-effective for laboratories and be of great value to patients.",2013,22903167,no
Detection of urinary excreted fungal galactomannan-like antigens for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.,"Mortality associated with invasive aspergillosis (IA) remains high, partly because of delayed diagnosis. Detection of microbial exoantigens, released in serum and other body fluids during infection, may help timely diagnosis. In course of IA, Aspergillus galactomannan (GM), a well established polysaccharide biomarker, is released in body fluids including urine. Urine is an abundant, safely collected specimen, well-suited for point-of-care (POC) testing, which could play an increasing role in screening for early disease. Our main objective was to demonstrate GM antigenuria as a clinically relevant biological phenomenon in IA and establish proof-of-concept that it could be translated to POC diagnosis. Utilizing a novel IgM monoclonal antibody (MAb476) that recognizes GM-like antigens from Aspergillus and other molds, we demonstrated antigenuria in an experimental animal IA model (guinea pig), as well as in human patients. In addition, we investigated the chemical nature of the urinary excreted antigen in human samples, characterized antigen detection in urine by immunoassays, described a putative assay inhibitor in urine, and indicated means of alleviation of the inhibition. We also designed and used a lateral flow immunochromatographic assay to detect urinary excreted antigen in a limited number of IA patient urine samples. In this study, we establish that POC diagnosis of IA based on urinary GM detection is feasible. Prospective studies will be necessary to establish the performance characteristics of an optimized device and define its optimal clinical use.",2013,22900046,no
Peptide binding to ochratoxin A mycotoxin: a new approach in conception of biosensors.,"Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a widespread and abundant natural carcinogenic mycotoxin produced by several species of Aspergillus and Penicillium fungi. Due to the ubiquitous presence of these fungi in food and potential risk for human health, a rapid and sensitive in vitro detection assay is required. Analytical methods for OTA detection/identification are generally based on liquid-liquid extraction, clean-up using an immunoaffinity column (IAC), and identification by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD). However, IACs are costly and have a short lifespan. Therefore, an interesting approach would appear to be the design and chemical synthesis of a mimotope peptide simulating mycotoxin-specific antibodies. We have developed a promising alternative method that is based on the use of peptides which are able to bind to specific chemical functions and/or molecular structures. Accordingly, a number of peptides (derived from the structures of major redox proteins) were selected and produced by chemical solid phase syntheses. The ability of such peptides to bind to ochratoxin A was evaluated by HPLC. The peptide NF04 (structurally derived from an oxidoreductase enzyme), which was found to be the sole potently reactive compound among tested molecules, was further evaluated in a peptide-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (peptide-based ELISA), thus confirming its specific interaction with ochratoxin A.",2013,22884651,no
In vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling of voriconazole activity against Aspergillus species in a new in vitro dynamic model.,"The pharmacodynamics (PD) of voriconazole activity against Aspergillus spp. were studied using a new in vitro dynamic model simulating voriconazole human pharmacokinetics (PK), and the PK-PD data were bridged with human drug exposure to assess the percent target (near-maximum activity) attainment of different voriconazole dosages. Three Aspergillus clinical isolates (1 A. fumigatus, 1 A. flavus, and 1 A. terreus isolate) with CLSI MICs of 0.5 mg/liter were tested in an in vitro model simulating voriconazole PK in human plasma with C(max) values of 7, 3.5, and 1.75 mg/liter and a t(1/2) of 6 h. The area under the galactomannan index-time curve (AUC(GI)) was used as the PD parameter. In vitro PK-PD data were bridged with population human PK of voriconazole exposure, and the percent target attainment was calculated. The in vitro PK-PD relationship of fAUC(0-24)-AUC(GI) followed a sigmoid pattern (global R(2) = 0.97), with near-maximum activities (10% fungal growth) observed at an fAUC(0-24) (95% confidence interval [CI]) of 18.9 (14.4 to 23.1) mg · h/liter against A. fumigatus, 26.6 (21.1 to 32.9) mg · h/liter against A. flavus, and 36.2 (27.8 to 45.7) mg · h/liter against A. terreus (F test P < 0.0001). Target attainment for 3, 4, and 5 mg/kg-of-body-weight voriconazole dosages was 24% (11 to 45%), 80% (32 to 97%), and 93% (86 to 97%) for A. fumigatus, 12% (5 to 26%), 63% (17 to 93%), and 86% (73 to 94%) for A. flavus, and 4% (2 to 11%), 36% (6 to 83%), and 68% (47 to 83%) for A. terreus. Based on the in vitro exposure-effect relationships, a standard dosage of voriconazole may be adequate for most patients with A. fumigatus but not A. flavus and A. terreus infections, for which a higher drug exposure may be required. This could be achieved using a higher voriconazole dosage, thus highlighting the usefulness of therapeutic drug monitoring in patients receiving a standard dosage.",2013,22869563,no
Serum Aspergillus galactomannan for the management of disseminated histoplasmosis in AIDS.,"Disseminated histoplasmosis is an emerging infection in patients with cellular immune deficiency in non-endemic countries, caused by the migration from endemic regions and the development of travels. Diagnosis can be challenging in this context because rapid diagnostic tools such as Histoplasma antigen detection or appropriate molecular tools are generally unavailable, serology is often negative in immunosuppressed patients, and isolation of the fungus from cultures often takes several weeks. Here, we report the contribution of galactomannan serum detection for the management of an HIV-infected patient with disseminated histoplasmosis.",2013,22855762,no
Assessment of total aflatoxin level in red pepper obtained from Istanbul.,"Aflatoxins (Aspergillus flavus toxins (AFT)) are biologically active secondary metabolites mostly produced by some Aspergillus species that causes hepatotoxicity, teratogenicity, immunotoxicity, and cancers in human. The aim of this study is to determine the level of total AFT in powdered red pepper in the retail markets in 40 district of Istanbul using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Of the 36 unpacked powdered red pepper samples, 32 samples (88%) contained AFT in the range of 0.2-106.4 µg/kg 16 samples (44.4%) were above the regulatory limit which is at 10 µg/kg for total AFT in Turkey. More precautions on the production, transport, harvest, and storage of red pepper should be taken on hygiene to prevent toxic and carcinogenic effects of AFT. ",2014,22851524,no
Galactomannan enzymatic immunoassay cross-reactivity caused by Prototheca species.,We report a reactive Aspergillus galactomannan enzymatic immunoassay against the serum of a patient with invasive Prototheca zopfii infection. Analysis of the supernatants of suspensions of P. zopfii and other Prototheca isolates revealed positive results as well. These data suggest cross-reactivity with the serum Aspergillus galactomannan assay in invasive protothecosis.,2013,22837317,no
Role of galactomannan determinations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from critically ill patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis: a prospective study.,"Critically ill chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients are at particular risk of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). Our aims were to determine whether bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) galactomannan (GM) has a higher sensitivity and specificity than serum GM or lower respiratory tract (LRT) sample culture. Furthermore, we aimed to investigate what the optimal cut-off value would be for BALF GM.In this prospective single-center study, BALF and serum samples were collected from critically ill COPD patients on the first day of their intensive care unit admission.Of 50 critically ill COPD patients admitted, BALF and serum samples were collected in 34 patients. According to the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, an optical density (OD) ratio of 0.8 was chosen as the cut-off value for GM in BALF. Compared to serum GM and LRT Aspergillus isolation, BALF GM yield a better sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 88.9%, 100%, 100% and 94.4%, respectively. Areas under the ROC curve were 0.912 (95%CI, 0.733 to 0.985) for BALF GM, and 0.879 (95%CI, 0.691 to 0.972) for serum GM results from the first day of ICU admission. Pairwise comparison of ROC curves showed P = 0.738. The OD ratio of BALF GM in IPA patients were significantly higher than those of non-IPA patients (2.88 ± 2.09 versus 0.49 ± 0.19, P = 0.009), and the OD ratio of BALF GM was significantly higher than serum GM in IPA patients (2.88 ± 2.09 versus 0.87 ± 0.47, P = 0.023). Positive BALF GM was seen earlier than LRT secretion culture (1 day versus 3.8 days).Compared to serum GM and LRT Aspergillus isolation, BALF GM seems to have a better sensitivity in the diagnosis of IPA in critically ill COPD patients. The ROC curve suggests a possible cut-off value of 0.8 for GM from BALF specimens in critically ill COPD patients.",2016,22835335,no
Interleukin-12 and interleukin-2 alone or in combination against the infection in invasive pulmonary aspergillosis mouse model.,"Aspergillus fumigatus is an intracellular opportunistic fungus causing invasive pulmonary mycosis, characterised by hyphal invasion and destruction of pulmonary tissue. Th1 cytokines could enhance fungicidal activity. The effects from the combination of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-2 are rarely known in invasive pulmonary aspergillosis infection. To assess the cleaning of A. fumigatus infection in the pulmonary tissues by IL-12 and IL-2, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) was detected in the sera using ELISA, quantification of IFN-γ mRNA using real-time RT-PCR and lung Colony-forming unit was assayed by cultivation. Morphology was analysed by histopathological examination. Our results showed that IL-12 and/or IL-2 could enhance the IFN-γ expression in the pulmonary tissue, reduce the colony load in the pulmonary tissue and increase the survival rate of mouse. The combination of IL-12 and IL-2 could assist in increasing the IFN-γ expression in the pulmonary tissue, but neither reduce colony load in the pulmonary tissue nor increase the survival rate of mouse significantly. It was demonstrated that IL-12 and IL-2 were strong immunomodulatory cytokines as a prerequisite for protecting the host from infectious agents.",2013,22834482,no
[Detection of laboratory biomarkes in haematological and pulmonology patients at high risk for aspergillosis].,"During the past decades a dramatic increase in the incidence of invasive fungal diseases, especially invasive aspergillosis has been observed. Undiagnosed and diagnosed late invasive aspergillosis is followed by lethality of up to 90%. Detection of early laboratory biomarkers (galactomannan and anti-Aspergillus antibodies) contributes to early diagnosis and is used for screening, as well as for monitoring therapy of aspergillosis.The aim was to evaluate usefulness of ""non-culture"" methods (galactomannan and anti-Aspergillus antibodies IgA, IgM and IgG) for early diagnosis of aspergillosis in high-risk patients.Prospective two-year study involved 262 high-risk patients for aspergillosis. In pulmonology and haematology patients (adults and children) blood samples were tested on galactomannan and anti-Aspergillus antibodies.Early laboratory biomarkers were statistically significantly higher in pulmonology patients (p = 0.00033). However, in haematological patients galactomannan was a more frequently positive finding, while in pulmonology patients it was the finding of anti-Aspergillus antibodies. It is interesting that, despite the possible immunosuppression, in about 1/3 of haematological patients anti-Aspergillus antibodies were confirmed.Early diagnosis and treatment of aspergillosis represent both clinical and laboratory problem. Nowadays, the application of new ""non-culture"" methods is of particular importance for the outcome of aspergillosis. Clinical features, laboratory findings of biomarkers and their correct interpretation significantly increase the possibility of timely implementation of appropriate therapy. In this regard, the new organization of reference laboratory for medical mycology has significantly improved the outcome of aspergillosis in high-risk patients in our country. However, further investigations, implementation of European standards and introduction of new diagnostic methods are necessary in this field.",2012,22826981,no
Combination of voriconazole and anidulafungin for treatment of triazole-resistant aspergillus fumigatus in an in vitro model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.,"Voriconazole is a first-line agent for the treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Isolates with elevated voriconazole MICs are increasingly being seen, and the optimal treatment regimen is not defined. We investigated whether the combination of voriconazole with anidulafungin may be beneficial for the treatment of A. fumigatus strains with elevated voriconazole MICs. We used an in vitro model of the human alveolus to define the exposure-response relationships for a wild-type strain (voriconazole MIC, 0.5 mg/liter) and strains with defined molecular mechanisms of triazole resistance (MICs, 4 to 16 mg/liter). All strains had anidulafungin minimum effective concentrations (MECs) of 0.0078 mg/liter. Exposure-response relationships were estimated using galactomannan as a biomarker. Concentrations of voriconazole and anidulafungin were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The interaction of voriconazole and anidulafungin was described using the Greco model. Fungal growth was progressively inhibited with higher drug exposures of voriconazole. Strains with elevated voriconazole MICs required proportionally greater voriconazole exposures to achieve a comparable antifungal effect. Galactomannan concentrations were only marginally reduced by anidulafungin monotherapy. An additive effect between voriconazole and anidulafungin was apparent. In conclusion, the addition of anidulafungin does not markedly alter the exposure-response relationship of voriconazole. A rise in serum galactomannan during combination therapy with voriconazole and anidulafungin should be interpreted as treatment failure and not attributed to a paradoxical reaction related to echinocandin treatment.",2013,22825124,no
Invasive aspergillosis associated with pulmonary hydatid disease.,"A patient presented with a cavitating lung lesion. Serology and sputum microscopy led to the diagnosis of pulmonary hydatid disease.

Serum IgG responses against Aspergillus proteins before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or chemotherapy identify patients who develop invasive aspergillosis.,"The ability to identify patients at particularly low risk for invasive aspergillosis (IA) would facilitate more efficient targeting of antifungal prophylaxis. We measured baseline serum immunoglobulin responses against 6 purified recombinant Aspergillus fumigatus proteins before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or chemotherapy in 73 subjects, including 19 patients who subsequently developed proven or probable IA and 54 uninfected controls. We also assessed responses at the time of IA diagnosis and 4 weeks later (acute and convalescent sera, respectively). Baseline IgG responses against enolase, Ahp1, Hsp90, Crf1, and Cdc37 were significantly higher in the patients with IA compared with controls (P < .05). Cutoff concentrations identified by receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis were 67%-84% sensitive and 52%-67% specific. In a population with a 15% likelihood of developing IA, positive and negative predictive values would be 22%-26% and 92%-95%, respectively. Positive IgG responses against Hsp90, Pep2, Crf1, and Cdc37 were specifically associated with early-onset IA (<40 days) rather than late-onset IA (P ≤ .009). Increased IgG concentrations against Hsp90, Pep2, and Crf1 in convalescent sera versus baseline sera were more likely in the patients with IA who survived (P ≤ .01). IgG responses in acute sera were not correlated with outcomes, and IgM and IgA responses did not differ in baseline, acute, or convalescent sera between the patients and controls. In conclusion, baseline IgG responses against Aspergillus proteins may be useful screening tests for patients at low risk for IA. Our data suggest that some patients with IA have significant colonization or ongoing Aspergillus infections before immunosuppression. As such, IA may reflect unique predispositions to infection and/or progression from endogenous sources.",2013,22824184,no
Production and characterisation of monoclonal antibodies for the quantification of potentially allergenic xylanase from Aspergillus niger.,"Xylanase from Aspergillus niger (ANX) is widely used in bakeries as a processing aid since it stabilises and improves dough quality. An association between allergic symptoms among bakery workers and sensitisation to ANX has been reported, indicating that this enzyme is an occupational allergen. The presence of ANX in dough improvers and semi-finished goods is often hidden due to incomplete and unclear labelling. The quantification of microbial enzymes in these products is necessary and the determination of the actual concentration of ANX in workplaces is therefore essential to assess the occupational risk. To this purpose we have developed and characterised monoclonal antibodies to ANX. The monoclonal antibodies do not show any cross-reaction with other commonly used microbial enzymes, and they allow the detection of ANX in complex mixtures by ELISA inhibition assays down to the concentration limit of approximately 10 µg kg(-1). These mAbs are a valuable tool to detect and quantify ANX and to investigate its allergenic potential in the workplace.",2012,22823937,no
A MIQE-compliant real-time PCR assay for Aspergillus detection.,"The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is widely used as a diagnostic tool in clinical laboratories and is particularly effective for detecting and identifying infectious agents for which routine culture and microscopy methods are inadequate. Invasive fungal disease (IFD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunosuppressed patients, and optimal diagnostic criteria are contentious. Although PCR-based methods have long been used for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA), variable performance in clinical practice has limited their value. This shortcoming is a consequence of differing sample selection, collection and preparation protocols coupled with a lack of standardisation of the PCR itself. Furthermore, it has become clear that the performance of PCR-based assays in general is compromised by the inadequacy of experimental controls, insufficient optimisation of assay performance as well as lack of transparency in reporting experimental details. The recently published ""Minimum Information for the publication of real-time Quantitative PCR Experiments"" (MIQE) guidelines provide a blueprint for good PCR assay design and unambiguous reporting of experimental detail and results. We report the first real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay targeting Aspergillus species that has been designed, optimised and validated in strict compliance with the MIQE guidelines. The hydrolysis probe-based assay, designed to target the 18S rRNA DNA sequence of Aspergillus species, has an efficiency of 100% (range 95-107%), a dynamic range of at least six orders of magnitude and limits of quantification and detection of 6 and 0.6 Aspergillus fumigatus genomes, respectively. It does not amplify Candida, Scedosporium, Fusarium or Rhizopus species and its clinical sensitivity is demonstrated in histological material from proven IA cases, as well as concordant PCR and galactomannan data in matched broncho-alveolar lavage and blood samples. The robustness, specificity and sensitivity of this assay make it an ideal molecular diagnostic tool for clinical use.",2013,22808087,no
Identification and Characterization of Useful Fungi with α-Amylase Activity from the Korean Traditional Nuruk.,"The objective of this study was to find useful fungi with α-amylase activity from the Korean traditional nuruk for the quality of traditional Korean alcoholic beverage. In this study, 165 samples of traditional nuruk were collected from 170 regions throughout Korea and the fungi were isolated to a total of 384 strains. In order to investigate the effect of microflora on nuruk, α-amylase activity, saccharogenic power (SP), starch hydrolysis activity and acid producing activity were evaluated. Ten strains were selected by α-amylase activity, which ranged from 458.47 to 1,202.75 U/g. The size of the discolored zone for the starch hydrolysis activity of each fungus ranged from 0.3 to 2 cm. The SP of the 10 strains ranged from 228.8 to 433.4 SP. Of the 10 stains, three were identified as Aspergillus oryzae, two as Aspergillus flavus, two as Lichtheimia sp., one as Rhizopus oryzae and two as other strains. The total aflatoxins present in the nuruks were examined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The 10 nuruks had less than 1.11 ppb of aflatoxins.",2012,22783116,no
Voriconazole for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis: a prospective multicenter trial.,"Early evidence suggests the efficacy of voriconazole for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA). We conducted a prospective, open, multicenter trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of voriconazole for proven CPA in minimally or non-immunocompromised patients. Patients had CPA confirmed by chest computed tomography (CT) and/or endoscopy, positive Aspergillus culture from a respiratory sample, and positive serologic test for Aspergillus precipitins. Patients received voriconazole (200 mg twice daily) for a period of 6-12 months and were followed for 6 months after the end of therapy (EOT). The primary endpoint was global success at 6 months, defined as complete or partial (≥50 % improvement) radiological response and mycological eradication. Forty-one patients with confirmed CPA were enrolled. All patients had A. fumigatus as the etiologic agent. By EOT, five patients had died from comorbidities and seven had discontinued voriconazole due to toxicity. The global success rate at 6 months was 13/41 (32 %): 10/19 (53 %) for chronic necrotizing aspergillosis and 3/22 (14 %) for chronic cavitary aspergillosis (p = 0.01). The respective success rates at EOT were 58 and 32 %. Clinical symptoms and quality of life also improved during treatment. Voriconazole is effective for CPA, with acceptable toxicity. The response rate is higher and obtained more rapidly in necrotizing than cavitary forms.",2013,22782438,no
High production of llama variable heavy-chain antibody fragment (VHH) fused to various reader proteins by Aspergillus oryzae.,"Llama variable heavy-chain antibody fragment (VHH) fused to four different reader proteins was produced and secreted in culture medium by Aspergillus oryzae. These fusion proteins consisted of N-terminal reader proteins, VHH, and a C-terminal his-tag sequence which facilitated purification using one-step his-tag affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis of the deglycosylated purified fusion proteins confirmed that the molecular weight of each corresponded to the expected sum of VHH and the respective reader proteins. The apparent high molecular weight reader protein glucoamylase (GlaB) was found to be suitable for efficient VHH production. The GlaB-VHH-His protein bound its antigen, human chorionic gonadotropin, and was detectable by a new ELISA-based method using a coupled assay with glucoamylase, glucose oxidase, peroxidase, maltose, and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine as substrates. Addition of potassium phosphate to the culture medium induced secretion of 0.61 mg GlaB-VHH-His protein/ml culture medium in 5 days.",2013,22752366,no
Therapy with antifungals decreases the diagnostic performance of PCR for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis in bronchoalveolar lavage samples of patients with haematological malignancies.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a life-threatening infection in severely immunocompromised patients, especially those receiving intensive chemotherapy or undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. As the clinical diagnosis of IA is mostly based on biomarkers (galactomannan, β-d-glucan, PCR assays) indicating Aspergillus as the underlying pathogen, the effect of antifungal treatment on the performance of these parameters is still controversial. We evaluated the effect of antifungal treatment on the performance of an Aspergillus-specific PCR assay in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples.Two-hundred-and-twenty-six BAL samples from 226 patients with haematological malignancies at high risk for IA classified according to the 2008 European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria were analysed retrospectively for the diagnostic performance of a nested Aspergillus PCR assay in relation to the number and type of mould-active antifungals received prior to BAL sampling.Sensitivity of BAL PCR for patients without antifungal treatment prior to BAL sampling was 0.69, whereas specificity was 0.87. While no significant change in diagnostic performance by the addition of one antifungal was observed, receiving two or more antifungals prior to BAL sampling led to a significant decrease in the diagnostic performance of BAL PCR testing (P < 0.009).Treatment with mould-active antifungals prior to BAL sampling significantly decreases the performance of the Aspergillus PCR assay in haematological patients if BAL was performed after administration of more than one antifungal agent. Performing BAL sampling for Aspergillus PCR diagnostic despite pre-treatment with one antifungal or while on prophylaxis is feasible.",2013,22740590,no
Using the galactomannan antigen assay in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is the most common life-threatening infections after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The serum galactomannan (GM) is recognized as an indirect mycological criteria for an early diagnosis of IA. Starting January 2011, we implementing in Fundeni Clinical Institute, Bucharest, for the first time in Romania, the detection of GM antigen (Platelia Aspergillus EIA, Bio-Rad). In 2011, patients undergoing HSCT were screened with the galactomannan ELISA we performed a retrospective chart review of 162 SCT patients who underwent galactomannan testing. Thirteen of the patients (8.02%) had at least one positive galactomannan ELISA, and four had multiple positive tests. When calculated in reference to a proved or probable diagnosis of aspergillosis, the galactomannan ELISA had a sensitivity of 0.857 and a specificity of 0.913. The positive predictive value was 0.46, and the negative predictive value was 0.993. The Platelia Aspergillus galactomannan antigenemia assay may assist physicians in making an early diagnosis of IA, in correlation with clinical and radiological criteria. The test has a high sensitivity and specificity and a very good negative predictive value. We found the screening of GM ELISA to be a highly specific diagnostic tool in detecting IA manifested in patients undergoing HSCT.",2013,22732810,yes
Systemic biomarkers of inflammation and haemostasis in patients with chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate mediators of inflammation and haemostasis in patients with chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis (CNPA), a locally, destructive process of the lung due to invasion by Aspergillus species.Measurements of selected biomarkers in 10 patients with CNPA and 19 healthy, matched controls were performed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and multiplex methodology. The gene expressions of relevant biomarkers were analyzed with real-time quantitative RT-PCR.Increased concentrations of circulating mediators of inflammation interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, RANTES, TNF-α, ICAM-1 and mediators involved in endothelial activation and thrombosis (vWF, TF and PAI-1) were observed in patients with CNPA. The concentration of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was increased both in plasma and in PBMC in the patient population. The gene expression of CD40L was decreased in PBMC from the patient group, accompanied by decreased concentrations of soluble (s) CD40L in the circulation.The proinflammatory response against Aspergillus may be counteracted by reduced CD40L and sCD40L, as well as increased IL-10, which may compromise the immune response against Aspergillus in patients with CNPA.",2013,22731696,no
[Serum antigens assay combined with chest CT scan in diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis].,"To evaluate serum antigens assay combined with chest CT scan in the diagnosis of patients of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) without neutropenia.One hundred and thirteen patients with suspected IPA admitted in Department of Respiratory Medicine, Infectious Diseased, Kidney Disease Centre and ICU were included in the study. Serum levels of 1-3-β-D-glucan (G) antigen and galactomannan antigen (GM) were assayed and chest CT scans were performed in all cases. Clinically invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was defined as proven, probable and possible. Treatment effectiveness was recorded.In this series 4 proven IPA, 36 probable IPA, 16 possible IPA, and 57 non-aspergillosis infection were diagnosed. GM test was more sensitive than G test. The specificity of two serum test was 84.2% and 87.7%, respectively. The sensitivity of chest CT was 30.0 %. The specificity of GM assay combined with chest CT was 100.0 %, while the sensitivity was 47.5%.The GM assay combined with chest CT may increase the specificity of diagnosis for IPA patients without neutropenia.",2012,22723171,yes
[Leather dust and sensitizing agents. A study on occupational indoor allergenic pollution in shoes].,"The study was aimed to ascertain a possible pollution by allergenic Mites in 15 samples of leather dust belonging to occupational environments of 4 Italian shoes factories. All dosages were both performed by a quantitative immunologic and ELISA method (Indoor Biotechnology Lmd) and a semi-quantitative colorimetric method (Aclotest Lofarma) and the results were compared according to a five steps risk-evaluation. In all factories allergenic components of Mites were documented. The highest concentration of Der p1 and Der f 1 in dust was 15,4 mcg/g, while allergens prevailed around the working-places, where discards of leather usually were collected. Moulds were studied in 29 samples of 9 shoes factories, adopting specific cultures. In all but one occupational environment moulds were present and taxa of Alternaria, Penicillium, Aspergillus, Cladosporium were prevalent, spores of them have known allergenic propert. Besides the identification, quantitative levels were not planned in this study. Dermatophytes were absent, while four taxa of Keratinophylic non allergenic moulds were observe. When leather dust are disperded in occupational environments a risk due to allergenic agents as secondary contamination must be carefully considered. Such a risk, according to our results, may be classified as ""intermediate for allergenic Mites"" and temptatively ""light for allergenic moulds"". Such a risk might be carefully considered for legal and preventive purposes and also monitored by occupational healthcare professionals.",2013,22697032,no
Adoptive immunity mediated by HLA-A*0201 restricted Asp f16 peptides-specific CD8+ T cells against Aspergillus fumigatus infection.,"Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) is the most common pathogen of invasive aspergillosis (IA), a life-threatening infection in immunocompromised patients. Recent findings revealed that CD8+ T cells can mediate cytotoxic activity against A. fumigatus. Here, we bioinformatically identified three HLA-A*0201-restricted peptides from Asp f16, an A. fumigatus antigen which was previously shown to be involved in T cell immunity. Our immunological results demonstrated that these peptides can potently induce cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response in CD8+ T cells, thus, damaging the conidia and hyphae of A. fumigatus. Moreover, the Asp f16 peptides can also raise Th1 cell-like response, as measured by interferon-γ (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT). Furthermore, we established an invasive pulmonary aspergillosis model in HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice. Adoptive transfer of Asp f16 peptides-specific CTL significantly extended the overall survival time in the A. fumigatus-infected immunocompromised mice. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the Asp f16 peptides might provide immunity against invasive A. fumigatus infection.",2013,22696051,no
Development of monoclonal antibody-based galactomannoprotein antigen-capture ELISAs to detect Aspergillus fumigatus infection in the invasive aspergillosis rabbit models.,"Aspergillus fumigatus is one of the most prominent opportunistic fungal pathogens in immunocompromised hosts. Early recognition of this infection along with prompt antifungal therapy may increase the survival rate. We expressed two potential bio-markers of A. fumigatus infection-galactomannoprotein Afmp1p and Afmp4p in Pichia pastoris. We generated 33 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), 20 against recombinant Afmp1p (rAfmp1p) and the other 13 against recombinant Afmp4p (rAfmp4p). Subsequently, we developed two antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) which employed MAbs as both the capture and the detection antibodies for rAfmp1p and rAfmp4p. The two antigen-capture ELISAs specifically detected Afmp1p/Afmp4p in cultures of A. fumigatus and had no cross-reaction with other tested pathogenic fungi, including Penicillium marneffei and other pathogenic Aspergillus species. The Afmp1p-captured ELISA would be positive even when the culture supernatant of A. fumigatus had been diluted to 128-fold of its original concentration. The two antigen ELISAs could capture circulating or excreted antigens during the acute phase of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in the animal model, and had no cross-reactivity to other Aspergillus-challenged animal models. We developed two antigen-capture ELISAs for the laboratory diagnosis of A. fumigatus infection. These two antigen-capture ELISAs may be useful in the clinical diagnosis of aspergillosis.",2013,22669560,no
Diagnosing pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with hematological malignancies: a multicenter prospective evaluation of an Aspergillus PCR assay and a galactomannan ELISA in bronchoalveolar lavage samples.,"Diagnosing invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) remains a challenge in patients with hematological malignancies. The clinical significance of testing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples both with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Aspergillus galactomannan ELISA (GM) is unclear, and the BAL cutoff for GM has not been clearly evaluated yet.Using a validated nested PCR assay and a GM ELISA, we prospectively examined BAL samples from 87 hematological patients at high risk of IPA. Of 76 (87%) evaluable patients, 29 patients had proven or probable disease.The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of GM optical density (OD) cutoff levels yielded a BAL OD of 0.5 to be optimal. We identified 29 probable or proven cases based on this OD. Sensitivity and specificity for BAL GM were 0.79 (95% CI, 0.62-0.9) and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.86-0.99), respectively. For BAL PCR, sensitivity and specificity were 0.59 (95% CI, 0.41-0.75) and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.75-0.94), respectively. Combining BAL GM and PCR for diagnosis showed a sensitivity and specificity rate of 0.55 (95% CI, 0.38-0.72) and 1.0 (95% CI, 0.93-1.0), respectively, if positivity was defined by positive results for both tests. If either positive BAL GM or positive BAL PCR results defined test positivity, the sensitivity was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.65-0.92), and the specificity was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.70-0.91)In terms of optimal sensitivity and specificity, a GM OD cutoff of 0.5 was determined for BAL samples. Positivity for both GM and Aspergillus PCR in BAL makes a pulmonary aspergillosis highly likely.",2012,22650156,no
Effects of glucomannan on the sacculus rotundus and peripheral blood lymphocytes in New Zealand rabbits during aflatoxicosis.,"This study was aimed to determine the effects of the glucomannan added to aflatoxin- (AF-) contaminated diet on the sacculus rotundus and peripheral blood lymphocytes of New Zealand rabbits by histological and enzyme histochemical methods. Twenty-four adult rabbits of both sexes were divided into four equal groups, namely, as control, glucomannan 0.2 g/day, AF 125 μg/kg/day, and glucomannan combined with AF. The animals in all groups were treated for 12 weeks by the above-mentioned diet. When compared to control, AF-treatment caused significant decrease in alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase- (ANAE-) positive peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) percentages. The addition of the glucomannan to AFcontaining diet recovered the adverse effects of AF on sacculus rotundus and increased the ANAE-positive PBL counts. These results suggested that glucomannan was effective against the negative effects of AF in rabbits.",2012,22645440,no
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is caused by an exaggerated T(H)2 response to the ubiquitous mold Aspergillus fumigatus.

This article reviews current understanding of the immunopathology, clinical and laboratory findings, and diagnosis and management of ABPA. It highlights clinical and laboratory clues to differentiate ABPA from cystic fibrosis and asthma, which are challenging given clinical and serologic similarities. A practical diagnostic algorithm and management scheme to aid in the treatment of these patients is outlined.",2013,22640845,no
Pharmacodynamics of voriconazole in a dynamic in vitro model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis: implications for in vitro susceptibility breakpoints.,"Voriconazole is a first-line agent for the treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). There are increasing reports of Aspergillus fumigatus isolates with reduced susceptibility to voriconazole.An in vitro dynamic model of IPA was developed that enabled simulation of human-like voriconazole pharmacokinetics. Galactomannan was used as a biomarker. The pharmacodynamics of voriconazole against wild-type and 3 resistant strains of A. fumigatus were defined. The results were bridged to humans to provide decision support for setting breakpoints for voriconazole using Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and European Committee of Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) methodologies.Isolates with higher minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) required higher area under the concentration time curves (AUCs) to achieve suppression of galactomannan. Using CLSI and EUCAST methodologies, the AUC:MIC values that achieved suppression of galactomannan were 55 and 32.1, respectively. Using CLSI and EUCAST methodologies, the trough concentration:MIC values that achieved suppression of galactomannan were 1.68 and 1, respectively. Potential CLSI breakpoints for voriconazole are ≤ 0.5 mg/L for susceptible and >1 mg/L for resistant. Potential EUCAST breakpoints for voriconazole are ≤1 mg/L for susceptible and >2 mg/L for resistant.This dynamic model of IPA is a useful tool to address many remaining questions related to antifungal treatment of Aspergillus spp.",2012,22634880,no
Comparison of serum and bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan in diagnosing invasive aspergillosis in solid-organ transplant recipients.,"This study sought to compare the sensitivities of serum galactomannan and bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan in diagnosing invasive aspergillosis in solid-organ transplant recipients (lung and heart).This study took place in the lung transplant center of the National Research Institute for Tuberculosis and Lung Disease. All patients with clinical and radiologic manifestations suggestive of pulmonary infection were included. Serum and bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan were measured.Seventeen patients were included (lung, 15 heart, 1Regarding the high levels of mortality and problems in diagnosing this disease, using bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan could be a suitable option.",2013,22631066,yes
Pharmacodynamics of itraconazole against Aspergillus fumigatus in an in vitro model of the human alveolus: perspectives on the treatment of triazole-resistant infection and utility of airway administration.,"Itraconazole is used for the prevention and treatment of infections caused by Aspergillus fumigatus. An understanding of the pharmacodynamics of itraconazole against wild-type and triazole-resistant strains provides a basis for innovative therapeutic strategies for treatment of infections. An in vitro model of the human alveolus was used to define the pharmacodynamics of itraconazole. Galactomannan was used as a biomarker. The effect of systemic and airway administration of itraconazole was assessed, as was a combination of itraconazole administered to the airway and systemically administered 5FC. Systemically administered itraconazole against the wild type induced a concentration-dependent decline in galactomannan in the alveolar and endothelial compartments. No exposure-response relationships were apparent for the L98H, M220T, or G138C mutant. The administration of itraconazole to the airway resulted in comparable exposure-response relationships to those observed with systemic therapy. This was achieved without detectable concentrations of drug within the endothelial compartment. The airway administration of itraconazole resulted in a definite but submaximal effect in the endothelial compartment against the L98H mutant. The administration of 5FC resulted in a concentration-dependent decline in galactomannan in both the alveolar and endothelial compartments. The combination of airway administration of itraconazole and systemically administered 5FC was additive. Systemic administration of itraconazole is ineffective against Cyp51 mutants. The airway administration of itraconazole is effective for the treatment of wild-type strains and appears to have some activity against the L98H mutants. Combination with other agents, such as 5FC, may enable the attainment of near-maximal antifungal activity.",2013,22615280,no
False-positive Aspergillus antigenemia due to blood product conditioning fluids.,"The presence of Aspergillus antigens in blood transfusion components from different manufacturers was analyzed.

Increase in interleukin-8 production from circulating neutrophils upon antibiotic therapy in cystic fibrosis patients.,"It is not known whether antibiotic therapy for lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) has an influence on circulating polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) function and apoptosis.Blood PMNs were obtained from 14 CF patients before and after antibiotic treatment for an acute exacerbation, and from 10 healthy controls. PMNs were evaluated for production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by spectrophotometry, of cytokines in the conditioned medium by ELISA, and apoptotic response by cytofluorimetry.ROS and interleukin (IL)-8 were produced at higher levels by CF PMNs pre-therapy than control PMNs under basal conditions. IL-8 levels further increased after therapy. Early apoptotic response was higher in CF PMNs pre-therapy than in control PMNs, and this pattern did not change after antibiotic treatment.Circulating PMNs are primed in CF acute patients. Further studies are needed to consider PMN-produced IL-8 as a biomarker to evaluate response to antibiotic therapy in CF patients.",2013,22608703,no
Immunochemical methods for ochratoxin A detection: a review.,"The safety of food and feed depends to a great deal on quality control. Numerous compounds and organisms may contaminate food and feed commodities and thus pose a health risk for consumers. The compound of interest in this review is ochratoxin A (OTA), a secondary metabolite of the fungi Aspergillus and Penicillium. Due to its adverse health effects, detection and quantification are of utmost importance. Quality control of food and feed requires extraction and analysis, including TLC, HPLC, MS, and immunochemical methods. Each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages. However, with regard to costs and rapidity, immunochemical methods have gained much interest in the last decade. In this review an introduction to immunochemistry and assay design will be given to elucidate the principles. Further, the application of the various formats to the detection and quantification of ochratoxin will be described, including the use of commercially available kits.",2012,22606375,no
Acute community acquired Aspergillus pneumonia in a presumed immunocompetent host.,"Infection from Aspergillus results in a wide range of diseases from simple Aspergillus pneumonia to fatal invasive Aspergillosis. Though the fungus is known to predominantly affect the immunocompromised host, it has also been known to cause acute pneumonia in immunocompetent hosts which is invariably fatal. It presents as an acute pneumonia with bilateral chest infiltrates on radiograph. Early clinical suspicion and microbiological identification by measures such as broncho alveolar lavage and initiation of therapy with voricanozole significantly increase the chances of survival. In this article the authors discuss a case of acute community acquired Aspergillus pneumonia in an immunocompetent host who survived due to early identification and prompt treatment with appropriate antifungal medication.",2013,22605848,no
An efficient method for transient gene expression in monocots applied to modify the Brachypodium distachyon cell wall.,"Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is widely used to produce insertions into plant genomes. There are a number of well-developed Agrobacterium-mediated transformation methods for dicotyledonous plants, but there are few for monocotyledonous plants.Three hydrolase genes were transiently expressed in Brachypodium distachyon plants using specially designed vectors that express the gene product of interest and target it to the plant cell wall. Expression of functional hydrolases in genotyped plants was confirmed using western blotting, activity assays, cell wall compositional analysis and digestibility tests.An efficient, new, Agrobacterium-mediated approach was developed for transient gene expression in the grass B. distachyon, using co-cultivation of mature seeds with bacterial cells. This method allows transformed tissues to be obtained rapidly, within 3-4 weeks after co-cultivation. Also, the plants carried transgenic tissue and maintained transgenic protein expression throughout plant maturation. The efficiency of transformation was estimated at around 5 % of initially co-cultivated seeds. Application of this approach to express three Aspergillus nidulans hydrolases in the Brachypodium cell wall successfully confirmed its utility and resulted in the expected expression of active microbial proteins and alterations of cell wall composition. Cell wall modifications caused by expression of A. nidulans α-arabinofuranosidase and α-galactosidase increased the biodegradability of plant biomass.This newly developed approach is a quick and efficient technique for expressing genes of interest in Brachypodium plants, which express the gene product throughout development. In the future, this could be used for broad functional genomics studies of monocots and for biotechnological applications, such as plant biomass modification for biofuel production.",2012,22589326,no
Vaccination with mannan protects mice against systemic aspergillosis.,"Invasive aspergillosis is a major cause of mortality in immunocompromised patients and therapeutic options are often limited, thus a vaccine would be desirable.

Evaluation of procalcitonin with liquid-phase binding assay in hematological malignancy.,"To determine procalcitonin (PCT) levels in blood, a newly analyzer based on liquid-phase binding assay (LBA) was developed (micro-total analysis system, μTAS). We evaluated analytical and clinical performance of this system in comparison with autoanalyzer based on chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA), which is widely-used but takes much longer time than LBA.A total of 518 serum samples from 28 patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were analyzed. The correlation between the 2 methods and the comparison of the each area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) for distinguishing bacterial or fungal infections from other events were evaluated.The minimum detection limit of serum PCT levels by LBA was 0.02 ng/ml. There was an excellent correlation between the two methods in all samples (r²=0.99), the samples obtained on days of fever onset (r²=0.99), and the samples collected in neutropenic state (r²=0.99). The AUC for detection of bacterial or fungal infection on the onset of fever was not significantly different between LBA and CLEIA (0.80 by LBA and 0.82 by CLEIA, P=0.19).The PCT measurement using LBA was well correlated with conventional method based on CLEIA and had enough clinical performance to detect bacterial or fungal infection in clinical setting.",2012,22579768,no
In vitro study on influence of some Streptomyces strains isolated from date palm rhizosphere soil on some toxigenic fungi.,"Date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) is considered the main crop in deserts and arid areas such as Saudi Arabia. Five Streptomyces species and other fungal species were isolated from date palm rhizosphere soil of several cultivars, such as Barhi, Khalas, Sullaj, and Sukkari, in the Ghat and El-Gouf regions. Streptomyces strains were isolated on Biolog universal growth agar medium and were identified following Biolog methods. The predominant Streptomyces isolated from this present survey was S. plicatus followed by S. rimosus, S. rutgersensus, and S. griseus. The number of soilborne fungi in the tested soil decreased with the increased number of isolated Streptomyces. There was a significant positive correlation between the date palm cultivar and the number of isolated Streptomyces. The in vitro effects of isolated Streptomyces species on some toxigenic fungi were also studied. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoaffinity column chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography were used to study the mycotoxins. The concentration of most of the tested mycotoxins was reduced significantly with the presence of the Streptomyces isolates. Results indicate that some Streptomyces isolates established in date palm rhizosphere have the ability to reduce production of mycotoxins of some toxigenic fungi thus they have the potential of reducing the subsequent disease occurrence. Therefore they can be applied in wider range as biocontrol agents.",2012,22571643,no
Bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan for the diagnosis of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis.,"Diagnosing chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) is complicated, and there are limited data available regarding the identification of galactomannan (GM) in clinical specimens to assist the detection of this infection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the detection of GM in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum and to assess its utility for diagnosing CPA. We retrospectively reviewed the diagnostic and clinical characteristics of 144 patients, with and without CPA, in Nagasaki University Hospital, Japan, whose BAL and serum specimens were examined for the presence of GM. The Platelia Aspergillus enzyme immunoassay (PA EIA) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mean values of BALF GM antigen were 4.535 (range, 0.062-14.120) and 0.430 (range, 0.062-9.285) in CPA (18) and non-CPA (126) patients, respectively. The mean values of serum GM antigen were 1.557 (range, 0.232-5.397) and 0.864 (range, 0.028-8.956) in CPA and non-CPA patients, respectively. PA EIA of BALF is superior to the test with serum, with the optimal cut-off values for BALF and serum of 0.4 and 0.7, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of PA EIA in BALF at a cut-off of 0.4 were 77.2% and 77.0%, respectively, whereas with serum at a cut-off of 0.7, they were 66.7% and 63.5%, respectively. GM testing using BALF showed reasonable sensitivity and specificity as compared to that using serum. Thus, assessing GM levels in BALF may enhance the accuracy of diagnosing CPA.",2013,22568603,no
Laboratory diagnostics of invasive fungal infections: an overview with emphasis on molecular approach.,"Although invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) are relatively rare, they have become an increasingly common life-threatening complication in a variety of critically ill patients. Due to changes in treatment strategies, patterns of IFDs have changed substantially as well. Yeast infections have shifted toward a higher proportion of non-albicans Candida species, but their overall incidence has remained stable. In contrast, IFDs caused by molds, including particularly various species of Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Mucorales, have increased in number. In view of the growing incidence and the high mortality rates of IFDs, accurate diagnostic techniques permitting timely onset of adequate antifungal treatment are of paramount importance. Although conventional approaches such as microscopy, cultivation, histopathological examination, and imaging methods still represent the gold standard, the diagnosis remains difficult because of limited sensitivity and specificity. Noninvasive and culture-independent diagnostic techniques, including fungal antigen detection, and different molecular-based techniques are becoming increasingly important. Of the fungal surrogate markers such as cell wall components, galactomannan and (1,3)-β-D-glucan by commercially available diagnostic kits have become widely used, but the results are still controversial. A plethora of PCR-based diagnostic methods targeting different gene regions and exploiting a variety of amplicon detection tools have been published. Molecular assays have the capacity to overcome the limitations of other diagnostic approaches, but the current lack of methodological standardization and validation, together with not always clear interpretation of the results, has prevented broad application in the clinical setting.",2012,22566119,no
The roles of surfactant protein D during Aspergillus fumigatus infection in human corneal epithelial cells.,"To investigate roles of surfactant protein D (SP-D) and relative cytokines in human corneal epithelial(HCE) cells exposed to aspergillus fumigatus (AF) antigens.HCE cells cultured in vitro with AF antigens and sampled at 0, 0.5, 1 hour, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours. The expression of SP-D mRNA was evaluated by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).The expression of SP-D protein was shown by ELISA and immunocytochemistry SP methods. The expression of NF-κB and relative downstream cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-8 and IL-10 in supernatant fluid were measured by ELISA.SP-D mRNA and protein were detected in untreated HCE cells. The expression of SP-D and the relative downstream cytokines rose after being stimulated with AF antigens. SP-D mRNA began to rise at 0.5 hour and the most significantly peak was in 2 hours. The protein of SP-D in supernatant fluid had the same trend with mRNA. Immunocytochemistry of SP-D showed positive expression and gradually increased to 6 hours, and then the expression began to decline. NF-κB was activated after treated by AF antigens and the changes had correlation with SP-D. TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-8 and IL-10 began to rise after given AF antigens 1 hour and were 1.82, 1.43, 1.12 and 1.28 times higher than the untreated HCE cells separately. The expression of TNF-α and IL-1β reached the peak at 2 hours, separately 2.80 and 2.86 times than the untreated. The expression of IL-8 and IL-10 gradually increased with a time-dependent manner.HCE cells exists SP-D and it may play a significant role in pathogenesis of keratomycosis. AF may induce human corneal epithelial cells to express inflammatory cytokines via SP-D and NF-κB pathway. SP-D possibly mediates the recognition to AF mycelium.",2012,22553747,no
Early serum galactomannan trend as a predictor of outcome of invasive aspergillosis.,"The monitoring and prediction of treatment responses to invasive aspergillosis (IA) are difficult. We determined whether serum galactomannan index (GMI) trends early in the course of disease may be useful in predicting eventual clinical outcomes. For the subjects recruited into the multicenter Global Aspergillosis Study, serial GMIs were measured at baseline and at weeks 1, 2, and 4 following antifungal treatment. Clinical response and survival at 12 weeks were the outcome measures. GMI trends were analyzed by using the generalized estimation equation approach. GMI cutoffs were evaluated by using receiver-operating curve analyses incorporating pre- and posttest probabilities. Of the 202 study patients diagnosed with IA, 71 (35.1%) had a baseline GMI of ≥ 0.5. Week 1 GMI was significantly lower for the eventual responders to treatment at week 12 than for the nonresponders (GMIs of 0.62 ± 0.12 and 1.15 ± 0.22, respectively P = 0.035). A GMI reduction of >35% between baseline and week 1 predicted a probability of a satisfactory clinical response. For IA patients with pretreatment GMIs of <0.5 (n = 131",2012,22553232,no
Serologic testing for aspergillosis in commercial broiler chickens and turkeys.,"Sera samples from commercial broiler chickens and turkeys diagnosed with respiratory and disseminated aspergillosis were tested for the presence of antigen and antibody to Aspergillus. Antigen detection consisted of testing for two cell-wall components, beta-glucan and galactomannan, which have been used extensively in human medicine. There were significantly higher levels of galactomannan in all broiler chicken submissions (100%) and antibody to Aspergillus in 6 out of 9 submissions (66.6%) vs. control birds. Beta-glucan analyses did not show any differences among levels in the broiler chicken groups. There were significantly higher levels of galactomannan antigen in 4 out of 7 submissions (57.1%) of aspergillosis in commercial turkeys, while only 2 out of 7 submissions (28.5%) had higher levels of antibody to Aspergillus vs. the control group. This study shows that diagnosis of respiratory and disseminated aspergillosis may be performed by detection of galactomannan antigenemia and antibodies in broiler chickens and to an extent in turkeys.",2012,22545542,no
Serum galactomannan in cystic fibrosis patients colonized with Aspergillus species.,"Cystic fibrosis patients are often colonized by Aspergillus species.

Immediate hypersensitivity and serum IgE antibody responses in patients with dermatophytosis.,"The association of dermatophytes with atopic patients and improvement in allergic signs with antifungal treatment suggest a possible link between chronic infection and atopy.The purpose of this study was to determine skin reactivity and serum IgE antibody responses in patients with chronic and acute dermatophytosis.One hundred and sixty-three patients with chronic dermatophytosis, 35 patients with acute dermatophytosis, 41 atopic patients and 49 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Sensitization to Trichophyton mentagrophytes (T. mentagrophytes), Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus antigens has been evaluated in patients by skin prick test (SPT) and by the presence of specific IgE antibody in enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA).Positive immediate hypersensitivity (IH) reactions were obtained in 95.1% of the atopic patients with chronic infection for T. mentagrophytes, representing a significant difference from other patient groups (P < 0.05). Specificanti-T. mentagrophytes IgE antibodies were detected in atopic patients with chronic (65.9%) and acute (50%) dermatophytosis, while none of the atopic subjects had positive IgE reactions to T. mentagrophytes.The results showed significant higher positive IH and specific anti-T. mentagrophytes IgE responses in atopic patients with chronic dermatophytosis than the other groups.",2012,22523906,no
Sensitivity and specificity of a blood and urine galactomannan antigen assay for diagnosis of systemic aspergillosis in dogs.,"Diagnosis of canine systemic aspergillosis requires fungal culture from a sterile site, or confirmatory histopathology from a nonsterile site. Invasive specimen collection techniques may be necessary.To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a serum and urine Aspergillus galactomannan antigen (GMA) ELISA assay for diagnosis of systemic aspergillosis in dogs.Multicenter study.Thirteen dogs with systemic aspergillosis and 89 dogs with other diseases. Thirty-seven of the 89 dogs had signs that resembled those of systemic aspergillosis and 52 dogs were not suspected to have aspergillosis.The GMA ELISA was performed on serum specimens from all dogs and urine specimens from 67 dogs. Galactomannan indices (GMI) ≥ 0.5 were considered positive. Results for dogs in each group were compared.The sensitivity and specificity of the assay for serum were 92 and 86%, respectively, and for urine were 88 and 92%, respectively. False negatives were seen only in dogs with localized pulmonary aspergillosis. Use of a cutoff GMI of 1.5 increased specificity to 93% for both serum and urine without loss of sensitivity for diagnosis of disseminated infection. High-level false positives (> 1.5) occurred in dogs with other systemic mycoses and those treated with Plasmalyte.Serum and urine Aspergillus GMA ELISA is a noninvasive, sensitive, and specific test for the diagnosis of disseminated aspergillosis in dogs when a cutoff GMI of ≥ 1.5 is used.",2013,22519720,no
Spontaneous eosinophilic nasal inflammation in a genetically-mutant mouse: comparative study with an allergic inflammation model.,"Eosinophilic inflammation is a hallmark of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. To model this disease process experimentally, nasal sensitization of mice with ovalbumin or aspergillus has been described. Here, we describe a genetically mutant mouse that develops robust spontaneous nasal eosinophilic inflammation. These mice lack the enzyme SHP-1 that down-regulates the IL-4Rα/stat6 signaling pathway. We compared nasal inflammation and inflammatory mediators in SHP-1 deficient mice (mev) and an ovalbumin-induced nasal allergy model.A novel technique of trans-pharyngeal nasal lavage was developed to obtain samples of inflammatory cells from the nasal passages of allergic and mev mice. Total and differential cell counts were performed on cytospin preparations. Expression of tissue mRNA for IL-4, IL-13, and mouse beta-defensin-1 (MBD-1) was determined by quantitative PCR. Eotaxin in the lavage fluid was assessed by ELISA.Allergic and mev mice had increased total cells and eosinophils compared with controls. Expression of IL-4 was similarly increased in both allergic and mev mice, but expression of IL-13 and eotaxin was significantly greater in the allergic mice than mev mice. Eotaxin was significantly up-regulated in both allergic rhinitis and mev mice. In both models of eosinophilic inflammation, down-regulation of the innate immune marker MBD-1 was observed.The mev mice display spontaneous chronic nasal eosinophilic inflammation with potential utility for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps research. The eosinophilic infiltrate is more robust in the mev mice than allergic mice, but Th2 cytokine expression is not as pronounced. Decreased MBD-1 expression in both models supports the concept that Th2-cytokines down-regulate sinonasal innate immunity in humans, and suggests a role for mouse models in investigating the interaction between adaptive and innate immunity in the sinonasal mucosa.",2012,22509389,no
"Diagnostic potential of nested PCR, galactomannan EIA, and beta-D-glucan for invasive aspergillosis in pediatric patients.","Limited specific data and investigations are available for invasive aspergillosis (IA) in pediatric patients. We evaluated the diagnostic potential of three noninvasive tests including the Platelia Aspergillus EIA kit for using galactomannan antigen, (1,3)-β-D-glucan Detection Reagent Kit, and nested-PCR for Aspergillus DNA in sera. We evaluated the diagnostic potential of three noninvasive tests including EIA for galactomannan antigen  (Platelia Aspergillus), nested  PCR assay for Aspergillus DNA and test for (1→3)-β-D-glucan (Glucatell assay Kit).All pediatric patients treated at the hematology/oncology unit who were at increased risk of developing invasive aspergillosis were enrolled. Clinical samples were examined for Aspergillus infections by mycological methods. Serial blood samples were collected twice weekly and evaluated by noninvasive tests.We analyzed 230 consecutive blood samples from 62 pediatric patients. The incidence rate of invasive aspergillosis in the patients was found to be 27.4%, and the etiologic agents were Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Aspergillus spp.  The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and likelihood ratios for positive and negative results of galactomannan in patients with proven and probable IA were 90%, 92%, 81.8%, 96%, 11.25, and 0.1 for beta-D-glucan they were 50%, 46%, 26%, 70.6%, 0.9, 0.9The conventional methods are not able to detect IA, due to the lack of valid and proper sampling. Galactomannan and nested-PCR tests in serum, with enough accuracy and reliability, can serve as noninvasive methods for the detection of IA in pediatric patients. However, the beta-D-glucan test cannot serve as an efficient diagnostic tool in those with hematologic disorders. ",2012,22505446,yes
Piperacillin/tazobactam (Tazocin™) seems to be no longer responsible for false-positive results of the galactomannan assay.,"Galactomannan (GM) testing is extremely useful for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis in high-risk patients, but false-positive results have been reported in patients treated with piperacillin/tazobactam. The aims of this study are to test if the recent piperacillin/tazobactam (Tazocin™ Pfizer) preparation still contains GM, and if serum GM positivity in haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients receiving piperacillin/tazobactam can be attributed to this treatment.Serum samples obtained from 1 October 2009 to 31 October 2010 from HSCT recipients for GM testing were analysed. The difference in the rate of positive results (defined as GM ≥ 0.5) in patients receiving and not receiving piperacillin/tazobactam was evaluated. Piperacillin/tazobactam vials from randomly selected batches were tested.Of 1606 samples drawn in the absence of piperacillin/tazobactam therapy, 25 (1.6%) tested positive for GM versus 10 of 394 samples (2.5%) drawn while on piperacillin/tazobactam (P = 0.18). The median GM result of samples drawn on piperacillin/tazobactam was slightly higher than that of samples drawn in the absence of piperacillin/tazobactam (0.141 versus 0.122 P < 0.001). All 90 piperacillin/tazobactam vials from 30 randomly selected batches tested negative for GM, with a median GM value of 0.057 (range: 0.011-0.320).Although some residual GM might still be present in piperacillin/tazobactam, currently available brand piperacillin/tazobactam preparations seem no longer responsible for false-positive GM results.",2012,22499998,no
Detection of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in haematological malignancy patients by using lateral-flow technology.,"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in haematological malignancy patients and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients(1). Detection of IPA represents a formidable diagnostic challenge and, in the absence of a 'gold standard', relies on a combination of clinical data and microbiology and histopathology where feasible. Diagnosis of IPA must conform to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycology Study Group (EORTC/MSG) consensus defining ""proven"", ""probable"", and ""possible"" invasive fungal diseases(2). Currently, no nucleic acid-based tests have been externally validated for IPA detection and so polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is not included in current EORTC/MSG diagnostic criteria.    Identification of Aspergillus in histological sections is problematic because of similarities in hyphal morphologies with other invasive fungal pathogens(3), and proven identification requires isolation of the etiologic agent in pure culture. Culture-based approaches rely on the availability of biopsy samples, but these are not always accessible in sick patients, and do not always yield viable propagules for culture when obtained.    An important feature in the pathogenesis of Aspergillus is angio-invasion, a trait that provides opportunities to track the fungus immunologically using tests that detect characteristic antigenic signatures molecules in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids. This has led to the development of the Platelia enzyme immunoassay (GM-EIA) that detects Aspergillus galactomannan and a 'pan-fungal' assay (Fungitell test) that detects the conserved fungal cell wall component (1 →3)-β-D-glucan, but not in the mucorales that lack this component in their cell walls(1,4). Issues surrounding the accuracy of these tests(1,4-6) has led to the recent development of next-generation monoclonal antibody (MAb)-based assays that detect surrogate markers of infection(1,5).    Thornton(5) recently described the generation of an Aspergillus-specific MAb (JF5) using hybridoma technology and its use to develop an immuno-chromatographic lateral-flow device (LFD) for the point-of-care (POC) diagnosis of IPA. A major advantage of the LFD is its ability to detect activity since MAb JF5 binds to an extracellular glycoprotein antigen that is secreted during active growth of the fungus only(5). This is an important consideration when using fluids such as lung BAL for diagnosing IPA since Aspergillus spores are a common component of inhaled air. The utility of the device in diagnosing IPA has been demonstrated using an animal model of infection, where the LFD displayed improved sensitivity and specificity compared to the Platelia GM and Fungitell (1 → 3)-β-D-glucan assays(7).    Here, we present a simple LFD procedure to detect Aspergillus antigen in human serum and BAL fluids. Its speed and accuracy provides a novel adjunct point-of-care test for diagnosis of IPA in haematological malignancy patients.",2012,22473419,no
[A clinical analysis of 7 cases of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis].,"To study the clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA).The clinical presentations, serologic results, chest radiology, pathological results and treatment of 7 patients with ABPA in Chinese PLA General Hospital were retrospectively analyzed.There were 4 males and 3 females, with a mean age of (33 ± 16) years. Before the diagnosis of ABPA, 6 cases had been misdiagnosed as bronchial asthma, 3 as pulmonary infection, 2 as tuberculosis and 1 as bronchiectasis. The main clinical manifestations included cough (n = 6), sputum production (n = 5), hemoptysis (n = 4), wheeze (n = 3), dyspnea(n = 3) and fever(n = 2). All cases had increased total serum IgE levels (median 3040 U/ml) and peripheral blood eosinophil count (median 0.19). Six of them showed increased peripheral eosinophil count median 1.84 × 10(9)/L, and skin test positive for Aspergillus antigen. Five of them had increased serum IgE antibodies specific to A. fumigatus (22 ± 15) kU/L, and 4 had increased serum IgG antibodies specific to A. fumigatus (108 ± 96) mg/L. The chest CT scan findings included transient or fixed pulmonary opacities, central bronchiectasis and finger-in-glove opacities. Five patients were treated with corticosteroids combined with antifungal therapy.Clinical features of ABPA include a history of asthma, elevation of the total serum IgE levels, presence of aspergillus IgE antibodies, peripheral eosinophilia, and transient or fixed pulmonary opacities and central bronchiectasis. Patients with asthma complicated with bronchiectasis should be routinely screened for Aspergillus skin test, and measurement of total serum IgE levels and chest CT scan are useful for confirmation of the diagnosis of ABPA. Oral glucocorticoids and anti-fungal drugs are effective in treatment of ABPA. Regular follow-up is needed for prevention of recurrence.",2013,22455941,no
The development and validation of an assay for the quantification of the P. chrysogenum allergen Pch52.,"Penicillium chrysogenum clade 4, is a common mold on damp building materials. A capture ELISA assay for the major allergen from P. chrysogenum Pch52 has been developed and tested in house dust samples and potential cross-reactivity examined. Minimal cross-reactivity with other relevant indoor fungi was observed for the assay following thorough purification of the monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. The limit of quantification for ELISA analysis of Pch52 in sieved house dust is comparable to other assays of other fungi. The LOQ for Pch52 was 0.31 ng/mL in solution or 110 ng/g dust. The LOQ for Asp f1 and Alt a1 were 2.2 ng/g and 17 ng/g, respectively. These results indicate this assay is suitable for the quantification of Pch52 in sieved house dust.",2012,22455645,no
Standardization and characterization of antigens for the diagnosis of aspergillosis.,"The aim of this study was to develop and characterize antigens for the diagnosis of aspergillosis. Nine strains of  Aspergillus  species  Aspergillus fumigatus ,  Aspergillus flavus , and  Aspergillus niger  were grown in Sabouraud and Smith broth to produce exoantigens. The antigens were tested by immunodiffusion against sera from patients with aspergillosis and other systemic mycoses. The protein fraction of the antigens was detected by SDS-PAGE Western blot and representative bands were assessed by mass spectrometry coupled to a nano Acquity UltraPerformance LC and analyzed by the Mascot search engine. Concurrently, all sera were tested with Platelia Aspergillus EIA. The most reactive antigens to sera from patients infected by A. fumigatus were produced by A. fumigatus MG2 Sabouraud and pooled A. fumigatus Sabouraud samples, both with a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 100% and 97%, respectively. Aspergillus niger and A. flavus antigens were reactive against A. niger and A. flavus sera, each one with a sensitivity and specificity of 100%. Two proteins, probably responsible for antigenic activity, β-glucosidase in A. fumigatus and α-amylase in A. niger were attained. The commercial kit had a specificity of 22%, sensitivity of 100%, positive predictive value of 48%, and negative predictive value of 100%. The antigens produced showed high sensitivity and specificity and can be exploited for diagnostics of aspergilloma.",2012,22452622,no
Serologic allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA-S): long-term outcomes.,"ABPA is radiologically classified on the presence or absence of central bronchiectasis (CB) as ABPA-CB and serologic ABPA (ABPA-S) respectively. Few studies have described the follow-up of patients with ABPA-S. The aim of this retrospective study was to describe the outcomes of ABPA-S.Patients were diagnosed as ABPA-S if they met all the following criteria: asthma, immediate cutaneous hyperreactivity to Aspergillus fumigatus antigen, total IgE levels >1000 IU/mL, A. fumigatus specific IgE levels >0.35 kUA/L and normal HRCT of the chest. They were treated with glucocorticoids and followed up with history, physical examination, chest radiograph and total IgE levels every 6 weeks to 3 months. In addition, an annual spirometry and a biennial HRCT chest were performed in all patients.Of the 55 patients with ABPA-S, 41 (17 men, 24 women mean age, 38.3 years) consented for performance of repeat HRCT scans. The median duration of asthma prior to diagnosis of ABPA was six years. The duration of follow-up ranged from 24 to 77 months with the mean (SD) follow-up duration being 43.7 (10.1) months. There was improvement in FEV(1) but not the FVC values during the follow-up period (p values = 0.001 and 0.5 for FEV(1) and FVC respectively). There was no development of CB in any patient. Sixteen patients had a relapse during the follow-up period, and six patients were classified as glucocorticoid-dependent ABPA.Although relapses are frequently seen, the long-term outcome of ABPA-S is good with no patient developing CB.",2012,22445696,no
Disinfection of ocular cells and tissues by atmospheric-pressure cold plasma.,"Low temperature plasmas have been proposed in medicine as agents for tissue disinfection and have received increasing attention due to the frequency of bacterial resistance to antibiotics. This study explored whether atmospheric-pressure cold plasma (APCP) generated by a new portable device that ionizes a flow of helium gas can inactivate ocular pathogens without causing significant tissue damage.We tested the APCP effects on cultured Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Herpes simplex virus-1, ocular cells (conjunctival fibroblasts and keratocytes) and ex-vivo corneas. Exposure to APCP for 0.5 to 5 minutes significantly reduced microbial viability (colony-forming units) but not human cell viability (MTT assay, FACS and Tunel analysis) or the number of HSV-1 plaque-forming units. Increased levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in exposed microorganisms and cells were found using a FACS-activated 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate probe. Immunoassays demonstrated no induction of thymine dimers in cell cultures and corneal tissues. A transient increased expression of 8-OHdG, genes and proteins related to oxidative stress (OGG1, GPX, NFE2L2), was determined in ocular cells and corneas by HPLC, qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis.A short application of APCP appears to be an efficient and rapid ocular disinfectant for bacteria and fungi without significant damage on ocular cells and tissues, although the treatment of conjunctival fibroblasts and keratocytes caused a time-restricted generation of intracellular ROS and oxidative stress-related responses.",2012,22432007,no
Phage display against corneal epithelial cells produced bioactive peptides that inhibit Aspergillus adhesion to the corneas.,"Dissection of host-pathogen interactions is important for both understanding the pathogenesis of infectious diseases and developing therapeutics for the infectious diseases like various infectious keratitis. To enhance the knowledge about pathogenesis infectious keratitis, a random 12-mer peptide phage display library was screened against cultured human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC). Fourteen sequences were obtained and BLASTp analysis showed that most of their homologue counterparts in GenBank were for defined or putative proteins in various pathogens. Based on known or predicted functions of the homologue proteins, ten synthetic peptides (Pc-A to Pc-J) were measured for their affinity to bind cells and their potential efficacy to interfere with pathogen adhesion to the cells. Besides binding to HCEC, most of them also bound to human corneal stromal cells and umbilical endothelial cells to different extents. When added to HCEC culture, the peptides induced expression of MyD88 and IL-17 in HCEC, and the stimulated cell culture medium showed fungicidal potency to various extents. While peptides Pc-C and Pc-E inhibited Aspergillus fumigatus (A.f) adhesion to HCEC in a dose-dependent manner, the similar inhibition ability of peptides Pc-A and Pc-B required presence of their homologue ligand Alb1p on A.f. When utilized in an eyeball organ culture model and an in vivo A.f keratitis model established in mouse, Pc-C and Pc-E inhibited fungal adhesion to corneas, hence decreased corneal disruption caused by inflammatory infiltration. Affinity pull-down of HCEC membrane proteins with peptide Pc-C revealed several molecules as potential receptors for this peptide. In conclusion, besides proving that phage display-selected peptides could be utilized to interfere with adhesion of pathogens to host cells, hence could be exploited for managing infectious diseases including infectious keratitis, we also proposed that the phage display technique and the resultant peptides could be used to explore host-pathogen interactions at molecular levels.",2012,22428072,no
Baseline platelet count and creatinine clearance rate predict the outcome of neutropenia-related invasive aspergillosis.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a life-threatening infection for immunocompromised patients. Improvement in IA outcome has been hampered by lack of early prognostic factors, namely, those available before starting chemotherapy (baseline) or early in the course of IA (nonbaseline). We hypothesized that prognostic factors can be identified before chemotherapy, ≤7 days from the first positive serum Aspergillus galactomannan index (s-GMI).We analyzed 98 patients with multiple myeloma who developed neutropenia-related IA and had a positive s-GMI. Three response criteria were used: kinetics of s-GMI, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) definitions, and 6-week survival. Baseline and nonbaseline variables were analyzed separately.Independent response predictors at baseline were a platelet count ≥65,000 platelets/mm(3) (odds ratio [OR], 1.009 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.001-1.017Two simple, inexpensive to measure, widely available, and routinely collected prechemotherapy values, platelet count and creatinine clearance rate, predict IA outcome and stratify patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk categories, while early evaluation of s-GMI allows timely treatment modification. These findings may improve patient outcomes by optimizing management strategies for this serious infection and may prove valuable in designing clinical trials of interventions to improve IA outcomes.",2012,22423136,no
Occurrence of Aspergillus spp. and aflatoxin B1 in Malaysian foods used for human consumption.,"Malaysian population widely consumes the cereal-based foods, oilseeds, nuts, and spices in their daily diet. Mycotoxigenic fungi are well known to invade food products under storage conditions and produce mycotoxins that have threat to human and animal health. Therefore, determining toxigenic fungi and aflatoxin B(1) (AFB1) in foods used for human consumption is of prime importance to develop suitable management strategies and to minimize risk. Ninety-five food products marketed in Penang, Malaysia were randomly collected from different supermarkets and were analyzed for presence of Aspergillus spp. by agar plate assay and AFB1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A. flavus was the dominant fungi in all foods followed by A. niger. Fifty-five A. flavus strains were tested for their ability to produce aflatoxins on rice grain substrate. Thirty-six (65.4%) strains out of 55 produced AFB1 ranging from 1700 to 4400 μg/kg and 17 strains (31%) produced AFB2 ranging from 620 to 1670 μg/kg. Natural occurrence of AFB1 could be detected in 72.6% food products ranging from 0.54 to 15.33 μg/kg with a mean of 1.95 μg/kg. Maximum AFB1 levels were detected in peanut products ranging from 1.47 to 15.33 μg/kg. AFB1 levels detected in all food products were below the Malaysian permissible limits (<35 μg/kg). Aspergillus spp. and AFB1 was not detected in any cookies tested. Although this survey was not comprehensive, it provides valuable information on aflatoxin levels in foods marketed in Malaysia.",2012,22417376,no
"X-ray diffraction, IR spectroscopy and thermal characterization of partially hydrolyzed guar gum.","Guar gum was hydrolyzed using cellulase from Aspergillus niger at 5.6 pH and 50°C temperature. Hydrolyzed guar gum sample was characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, dilute solution viscometry and rotational viscometry. Viscometry analysis of native guar gum showed a molecular weight of 889742.06, whereas, after enzymatic hydrolysis, the resultant product had a molecular weight of 7936.5. IR spectral analysis suggests that after enzymatic hydrolysis of guar gum there was no major transformation of functional group. Thermal analysis revealed no major change in thermal behavior of hydrolyzed guar gum. It was shown that partial hydrolysis of guar gum could be achieved by inexpensive and food grade cellulase (Aspergillus niger) having commercial importance and utilization as a functional soluble dietary fiber for food industry.",2012,22409871,no
Urinary corticosterone metabolites and chytridiomycosis disease prevalence in a free-living population of male Stony Creek frogs (Litoria wilcoxii).,"The emerging amphibian disease chytridiomycosis, which is caused by the fungal pathogen (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, Bd), has caused mass mortalities of native amphibian populations globally. There have been no previous studies on the relationships between stress hormones in free-living amphibians and Bd infections. In this study, we measured urinary corticosterone metabolite concentrations and Bd infections within free-living populations of male Stony Creek frog (Litoria wilcoxii) in Queensland, Australia. Prevalence of Bd zoospores from frog skin swabs was quantified using a real-time quantitative PCR technique. A urinary corticosterone enzyme-immunoassay (EIA) was validated using adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge. Urinary corticosterone concentrations of male frogs increased within 1-2 days after ACTH challenge and returned to baseline levels within 3 days post-ACTH injection. None of the frogs showed any rise in urinary corticosterone after saline injections. Individual male frogs showed either low or high baseline corticosterone concentrations. Male frogs identified as positive for Bd infection had significantly higher baseline urinary corticosterone concentrations in comparison to Bd negative male frogs. Urinary corticosterone EIA provides a reliable indication of stress in this frog species and this non-invasive physiological tool can be used to further assess the dynamics of Bd infections and physiological stress responses in other native amphibians.",2012,22387450,no
Diagnostic value of the serum galactomannan assay for invasive aspergillosis: it is less useful in non-haematological patients.,"The serum galactomannan assay (GMA) has been widely used for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA). GMA is mainly used in patients with haematological malignancies or in those who have undergone haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, there are few data from non-haematological patients. We evaluated whether GMA is useful for the diagnosis of IA in non-haematological patients.Patients who were subjected to serum GMA testing from January 2007 to December 2009 were evaluated retrospectively. Patients with haematological diseases or who underwent HSCT were excluded from our analysis. According to the criteria of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group revised in 2008, the patients were categorized as proven, probable, possible, or non-IA. Proven and probable cases were defined as IA in this study.Out of 778 patients, 13 (1.6%) had proven (n =9) or probable (n =4) IA. The sensitivity of the GMA was 23.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.1-54.0%) and the specificity was 76.1% (95% CI 72.9-79.0%). The positive predictive value was 1.6% (95% CI 0.4-5.0%) and the negative predictive value was 98.3% (95% CI 96.8-99.1%). The likelihood ratios of a positive and negative test were 0.96 (95% CI 0.35-2.62) and 1.01 (95% CI 0.75-1.36), respectively.In this study, the sensitivity of the GMA for the diagnosis of IA was very low in non-haematological patients. Although the GMA test is considered useful for the diagnosis of IA in haematological patients, it had low diagnostic value for IA in non-haematological patients.",2013,22385270,yes
Dectin-1 and DC-SIGN polymorphisms associated with invasive pulmonary Aspergillosis infection.,"The recognition of pathogen-derived structures by C-type lectins and the chemotactic activity mediated by the CCL2/CCR2 axis are critical steps in determining the host immune response to fungi. The present study was designed to investigate whether the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within DC-SIGN, Dectin-1, Dectin-2, CCL2 and CCR2 genes influence the risk of developing Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis (IPA). Twenty-seven SNPs were selected using a hybrid functional/tagging approach and genotyped in 182 haematological patients, fifty-seven of them diagnosed with proven or probable IPA according to the 2008 EORTC/MSG criteria. Association analysis revealed that carriers of the Dectin-1(rs3901533 T/T) and Dectin-1(rs7309123 G/G) genotypes and DC-SIGN(rs4804800 G), DC-SIGN(rs11465384 T), DC-SIGN(7248637 A) and DC-SIGN(7252229 C) alleles had a significantly increased risk of IPA infection (OR = 5.59 95%CI 1.37-22.77 OR = 4.91 95%CI 1.52-15.89",2012,22384201,no
"The performance of real-time PCR, galactomannan, and fungal culture in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in ventilated patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).","Emerging reports have associated chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD) with invasive aspergillosis (IA), particularly in patients treated with mechanical ventilation and/or corticosteroids. This is a multicentre study in which COPD patients demonstrating a new lung infiltrate while being mechanically ventilated were prospectively evaluated for the presence of IA. From the 47 patients studied, Aspergillus fumigatus was recovered in culture in two patients (4.2%). While serum galactomannan (GM) was negative for 94% of patients, GM levels in respiratory samples were >0.5, >1.0 and >1.5 for 74.5, 40.5, and 21.3% of patients, respectively. PCR was positive for 10 patients in the study but did not differentiate Aspergillus colonization from infection. The combination of PCR and GM in respiratory samples may be an interesting alternative to diagnose IA in COPD patients.",2012,22382738,no
Characterization of hemicellulases from thermophilic fungi.,"The thermophilic fungi Thermomyces lanuginosus, Malbranchea cinnamomea, Myceliophthora fergusii and the thermotolerant Aspergillus terreus were cultivated on various carbon sources, and hemicellulolytic and cellulolytic enzyme profiles were evaluated. All fungi could grow on locust bean galactomannan (LBG), Solka floc, wheat bran and pectin, except T. lanuginosus, which failed to utilize LBG for growth. Different levels of cellulase and hemicellulase activities were produced by these fungal strains. Depending on the carbon source, variable ratios of thermostable hydrolytic enzymes were obtained, which may be useful in various applications. All strains were found to secrete xylanolytic and mannanolytic enzymes. Generally, LBG was the most efficient carbon source to induce mannanase activities, although T. lanuginosus was able to produce mannanase only on wheat bran as a carbon source. Xylanolytic activities were usually highest on wheat bran medium, but in contrast to other investigated fungi, xylanase production by M. fergusii was enhanced on pectin medium. Preliminary thermostability screening indicated that among the investigated species, thermotolerant glycosidases can be found. Some of the accessory activities, including the α-arabinosidase activity, were surprisingly high. The capability of the produced enzymes to improve the hydrolysis of lignocellulosic pretreated substrate was evaluated and revealed potential for these enzymes.",2012,22371150,no
Antibody specific to thioredoxin reductase as a new biomarker for serodiagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in non-neutropenic patients.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is an important cause of mortality in critically ill patients, but the diagnosis is difficult as clinical and radiological signs are neither sensitive nor specific. Serum galactomannan (GM) is a useful marker for IA, but exhibits low sensitivity in non-neutropenic patients. In our previous work, strong antibody reactivity to thioredoxin reductase of Aspergillus fumigatus was found in non-neutropenic IA patients.Using recombinant thioredoxin reductase GliT (TR), an antigenic protein secreted by A. fumigatus, as the coating antigen, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting anti-TR antibodies was developed. The antibody response to TR in IA animal models and 42 non-neutropenic patients with culture- and/or histology-documented IA was investigated. The results showed that anti-TR antibody was detectable in rabbit serum 7-9 days after exposure to the fungus. The sensitivity and specificity of the anti-TR antibody assay in patients were 80.9% and 96%, respectively, while the sensitivity of GM in this group of patients was only 52.3%. The specificity of the assay was confirmed by testing the sera from patients infected with other pathogenic fungal species and bacteria.",2012,22366166,no
Disseminated mycosis in a killer whale (Orcinus orca).,"Hematological findings in a female killer whale (Orcinus orca) undergoing rehabilitation after sudden severe anorexia revealed continuing increases in serum lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase activities as well as fibrinogen concentration. Serologic evidence of herpesvirus infection and skin vesicles were detected 2 weeks into the treatment regimen of antibiotics and corticosteroids. The whale showed signs of improvement after treatment with anti-herpesvirus drugs, but sudden severe anorexia reappeared, along with marked elevation of fibrinogen concentration that continued until the death. Postmortem examination revealed multiple light tan foci of necrosis in the skeletal and cardiac muscles, and lung consolidation. Microscopic findings indicated disseminated fungal granulomas in the skeletal and cardiac muscles, as well as myocarditis, mycotic embolic thromboarteritis of cardiac blood vessels, and bronchopneumonia with numerous typical Aspergillus-like fungi. Mucor-like structures in granulomas in the heart and skeletal muscle and Aspergillus-like fungi in the lungs were identified using periodic acid-Schiff, Gomori methenamine silver stain, and immunohistochemistry. The present case involves dual infection with Mucor and Aspergillus species in a killer whale with concurrent herpesvirus.",2012,22362957,no
Polymerase chain reaction-based assays for the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections.,"Currently accepted fungal diagnostic techniques, such as culture, biopsy, and serology, lack rapidity and efficiency. Newer diagnostic methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays, have the potential to improve fungal diagnostics in a faster, more sensitive, and specific manner. Preliminary data indicate that, when PCR-based fungal diagnostic assays guide antifungal therapy, they may lower patient mortality and decrease unnecessary antifungal treatment, improving treatment-associated costs and avoiding toxicity. Moreover, newer PCR techniques can identify antifungal resistance DNA loci, but the clinical correlation between those loci and clinical failure has to be studied further. In addition, future studies need to focus on the implementation of PCR techniques in clinical decision making and on combining them with other diagnostic tests. A consensus on the standardization of PCR techniques, along with validation from large prospective studies, is necessary to allow widespread adoption of these assays.",2013,22362884,no
"Effects of sterigmatocystin on TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-12 expression in murine             peripheral blood mononuclear cells and peritoneal macrophages in vivo.","Sterigmatocystin (ST) is a toxic metabolite mainly produced by the fungi             Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus versicolor. ST is considered a potent carcinogen,             mutagen and teratogen. However, over the past few years, it has been demonstrated             that it is less acutely toxic to rodents in vivo. In this study, we evaluated             the putative effects of ST on the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α),             interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-12 at mRNA levels in murine peripheral blood mononuclear             cells (mPBMCs) and peritoneal macrophage cells and on the serum TNF-α and IL-6             levels in BALB/c mice. Our results show the downregulation of TNF-α, IL-6 and             IL-12 mRNA expression in mPBMCs and peritoneal macrophage cells using semi-quantitative             reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction following ST treatment by intraperitoneal             injection. Additionally, serum TNF-α and IL-6 levels were also decreased as shown             by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). These results suggest that ST contamination             has negative immunomodulatory effects through the downregulation of cytokine expression             and secretion.",2012,22344519,no
[Aspergillosis. Clinical forms and treatment].,"Invasive aspergillosis, chronic pulmonary aspergillosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis are the clinical forms of aspergillosis. Although there is a great number of Aspergillus species, Aspergillus fumigatus-complex is the more frequent aetiological agent, regardless of clinical form or baseline condition. The increase in immunosuppressive agents and the higher use of corticosteroids in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have led to aspergillosis becoming more prominent in recent years. Galactomannan detection and radiological diagnostic images complement the limitations of microbiology cultures in these patients. Voriconazole and liposomal amphotericin B are the gold standard in patients requiring therapy, and posaconazole, itraconazole, caspofungin and other echinocandins are effective alternatives. The prognosis depends of clinical forms and characteristics of the host, but it is particularly poor in the disseminated invasive forms.",2012,22341751,no
Alternaria induces STAT6-dependent acute airway eosinophilia and epithelial FIZZ1 expression that promotes airway fibrosis and epithelial thickness.,"The fungal allergen, Alternaria, is specifically associated with severe asthma, including life-threatening exacerbations. To better understand the acute innate airway response to Alternaria, naive wild-type (WT) mice were challenged once intranasally with Alternaria. Naive WT mice developed significant bronchoalveolar lavage eosinophilia following Alternaria challenge when analyzed 24 h later. In contrast to Alternaria, neither Aspergillus nor Candida induced bronchoalveolar lavage eosinophilia. Gene microarray analysis of airway epithelial cell brushings demonstrated that Alternaria-challenged naive WT mice had a >20-fold increase in the level of expression of found in inflammatory zone 1 (FIZZ1/Retnla), a resistin-like molecule. Lung immunostaining confirmed strong airway epithelial FIZZ1 expression as early as 3 h after a single Alternaria challenge that persisted for ≥5 d and was significantly reduced in STAT6-deficient, but not protease-activated receptor 2-deficient mice. Bone marrow chimera studies revealed that STAT6 expressed in lung cells was required for epithelial FIZZ1 expression, whereas STAT6 present in bone marrow-derived cells contributed to airway eosinophilia. Studies investigating which cells in the nonchallenged lung bind FIZZ1 demonstrated that CD45(+)CD11c(+) cells (macrophages and dendritic cells), as well as collagen-1-producing CD45(-) cells (fibroblasts), can bind to FIZZ1. Importantly, direct administration of recombinant FIZZ1 to naive WT mice led to airway eosinophilia, peribronchial fibrosis, and increased thickness of the airway epithelium. Thus, Alternaria induces STAT6-dependent acute airway eosinophilia and epithelial FIZZ1 expression that promotes airway fibrosis and epithelial thickness. This may provide some insight into the uniquely pathogenic aspects of Alternaria-associated asthma.",2012,22327070,no
Persistence versus escape: Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus fumigatus employ different strategies during interactions with macrophages.,"Invasive bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (IBPA) is a life-threatening disease in immunocompromised patients. Although Aspergillus terreus is frequently found in the environment, A. fumigatus is by far the main cause of IBPA. However, once A. terreus establishes infection in the host, disease is as fatal as A. fumigatus infections. Thus, we hypothesized that the initial steps of disease establishment might be fundamentally different between these two species. Since alveolar macrophages represent one of the first phagocytes facing inhaled conidia, we compared the interaction of A. terreus and A. fumigatus conidia with alveolar macrophages. A. terreus conidia were phagocytosed more rapidly than A. fumigatus conidia, possibly due to higher exposure of β-1,3-glucan and galactomannan on the surface. In agreement, blocking of dectin-1 and mannose receptors significantly reduced phagocytosis of A. terreus, but had only a moderate effect on phagocytosis of A. fumigatus. Once phagocytosed, and in contrast to A. fumigatus, A. terreus did not inhibit acidification of phagolysosomes, but remained viable without signs of germination both in vitro and in immunocompetent mice. The inability of A. terreus to germinate and pierce macrophages resulted in significantly lower cytotoxicity compared to A. fumigatus. Blocking phagolysosome acidification by the v-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin increased A. terreus germination rates and cytotoxicity. Recombinant expression of the A. nidulans wA naphthopyrone synthase, a homologue of A. fumigatus PksP, inhibited phagolysosome acidification and resulted in increased germination, macrophage damage and virulence in corticosteroid-treated mice. In summary, we show that A. terreus and A. fumigatus have evolved significantly different strategies to survive the attack of host immune cells. While A. fumigatus prevents phagocytosis and phagolysosome acidification and escapes from macrophages by germination, A. terreus is rapidly phagocytosed, but conidia show long-term persistence in macrophages even in immunocompetent hosts.",2012,22319619,no
Invasive fungal infections in patients with hematologic malignancies (aurora project): lights and shadows during 18-months surveillance.,"The aim of this multicenter prospective study was to evaluate the incidence of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) in adult and pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies, involving nine nosocomial facilities in Southern Italy over a period of 18 months. Furthermore, results of an environmental microbial surveillance routinely carried out in some of the enrolled hospitals are reported. A total of 589 onco-hematological patients were enrolled and 27 IFIs were documented. The main infections were caused by yeasts, more than filamentous fungi (overall incidence of 2.7% and 1.9%, respectively). The yeasts were mainly represented by Candida spp. (87.5%), all isolated by blood cultures C. parapsilosis was the most common species. Among mould infections, the most frequent site was the lung, with regard to aspergillosis (81.8%). In six of the 10 patients with suspected aspergillosis, the diagnosis was made by the detection of galactomannan and (1,3)-β-d-glucan antigens. The microbiological surveillance carried out on 156 air, 312 water and 312 surface samples revealed low environmental contamination: Alternaria alternata was the only fungus isolated from two surface samples. Our data, especially the low occurrence of filamentous fungi, suggest a particular local epidemiology. Further studies are needed to confirm this microbiological trend in onco-hematological patients in Southern Italy, the results of which might be helpful to improve the management of these patients.",2012,22312285,no
[Huge aspergilloma developed within a zone of scleroderma-related pulmonary fibrosis].,"In pulmonary aspergilloma, Aspergillus colonizes and proliferates as a saprophyte in deterged cavities deprived of local defense. Although pulmonary tuberculosis constitutes the one well-know predisposing factor, other causes can create favorable conditions. We describe a first published case of a huge aspergilloma which developed within a zone of pulmonary fibrosis secondary to systemic scleroderma. The patient was a 58-year-old woman in poor general health who experienced repeated episodes of hemoptysis and dyspnea. Physical examination disclosed sclerodactyly, generalized cutaneous sclerosis and Raynaud's phenomenon. There was no clinical history of pulmonary tuberculosis or bronchectasis. Aspergillosis serology was positive. Broncho-alveolar liquid was positive for Aspergillus fumigatus at direct examination and after culture. Immunological assessment confirmed scleroderma. The chest computed tomography scan showed a huge oblong-shaped opacity in the upper left lobe which had developed within a zone of pulmonary fibrosis. Medical management was instituted. The clinical course was marked by repeating hemoptysis and the stability of pulmonary lesions after two years. Management of scleroderma-related pulmonary aspergiloma remains difficult and complicated. Prognosis depends on the course of both conditions, scleroderma and aspergillosis.",2013,22305135,no
Detection of galactomannan in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples of patients at risk for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis: analytical and clinical validity.,"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is frequent and often fatal in immunosuppressed patients. Timely diagnosis of IPA improves survival but is difficult to make. We examined the analytical and clinical validity of galactomannan (GM) testing of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in diagnosing IPA in a mixed population by retrospectively reviewing records of 251 consecutive at-risk patients for whom BAL fluid GM testing was ordered. The performance of the enzyme immunoassay was evaluated by using a range of index cutoffs to define positivity. Three samples were associated with proven IPA, 56 were associated with probable IPA, 63 were associated with possible invasive fungal disease (IFD), and 129 were associated with no IFD. Using a BAL fluid GM index of ≥0.8 (optimal optical density [OD] index cutoff identified by a receiver operating characteristic curve), the sensitivity in diagnosing proven and probable IPA was 86.4%, and the specificity was 90.7%. At this cutoff, positive and negative predictive values were 81% and 93.6%, respectively. However, an OD index value of ≥3.0 corresponded to a 100% specificity, thus ruling the disease in, irrespective of the pretest probability. Conversely, an OD index cutoff of <0.5 corresponded to a high sensitivity, virtually always ruling the disease out. For all values in between, the posttest probability of IPA depends largely on the prevalence of disease in the at-risk population and the likelihood ratio of the OD index value. Detection of GM in BAL fluid samples of patients at risk of IPA has an excellent diagnostic accuracy provided results are interpreted in parallel with clinico-radiological findings and pretest probabilities.",2012,22301025,no
"Trichostatin A abrogates airway constriction, but not inflammation, in murine and human asthma models.","Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors may offer novel approaches in the treatment of asthma. We postulate that trichostatin A (TSA), a Class 1 and 2 inhibitor of HDAC, inhibits airway hyperresponsiveness in antigen-challenged mice. Mice were sensitized and challenged with Aspergillus fumigatus antigen (AF) and treated with TSA, dexamethasone, or vehicle. Lung resistance (R(L)) and dynamic compliance were measured, and bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was analyzed for numbers of leukocytes and concentrations of cytokines. Human precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) were treated with TSA and their agonist-induced bronchoconstriction was measured, and TSA-treated human airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells were evaluated for the agonist-induced activation of Rho and intracellular release of Ca(2+). The activity of HDAC in murine lungs was enhanced by antigen and abrogated by TSA. TSA also inhibited methacholine (Mch)-induced increases in R(L) and decreases in dynamic compliance in naive control mice and in AF-sensitized and -challenged mice. Total cell counts, concentrations of IL-4, and numbers of eosinophils in BALF were unchanged in mice treated with TSA or vehicle, whereas dexamethasone inhibited the numbers of eosinophils in BALF and concentrations of IL-4. TSA inhibited the carbachol-induced contraction of PCLS. Treatment with TSA inhibited the intracellular release of Ca(2+) in ASM cells in response to histamine, without affecting the activation of Rho. The inhibition of HDAC abrogates airway hyperresponsiveness to Mch in both naive and antigen-challenged mice. TSA inhibits the agonist-induced contraction of PCLS and mobilization of Ca(2+) in ASM cells. Thus, HDAC inhibitors demonstrate a mechanism of action distinct from that of anti-inflammatory agents such as steroids, and represent a promising therapeutic agent for airway disease.",2012,22298527,no
Galactomannan testing might be useful for early diagnosis of fusariosis.,"Galactomannan (GM) is used to diagnose aspergillosis. We present a case of a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipient with fusariosis who received early antifungal treatment based on GM positivity. Additionally, 3 Fusarium isolates tested positive for GM. Fusarium is another mold containing GM. GM might be useful for diagnosing fusariosis in high-risk patients.",2012,22280997,no
"A Novel endo-1,4-β-mannanase from Bispora antennata with good adaptation and stability over a broad pH range.","An endo-β-1,4-mannanase encoding gene, man5, was cloned from Bispora antennata CBS 126.38, which was isolated from a beech stump. The cDNA of man5 consists of 1,299 base pairs and encodes a 432-amino-acid protein with a theoretical molecular mass of 46.6 kDa. Deduced MAN5 exhibited the highest amino acid sequence identity of 58% to a β-mannanase of glycoside hydrolase family 5 from Aspergillus aculeatus. Recombinant MAN5 was expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. The specific activity of the final preparation towards locust bean gum was 289 U mg(-1). MAN5 showed optimal activity at pH 6.0 and 70 °C and had good adaptation and stability over a broad range of pH values. The enzyme showed more than 60% of peak activity at pH 3.0-8.0 and retained more than 80% of activity after incubation at 37 °C for 1 h in both acid and alkaline conditions (pH 4.0-11.0). The K                         (m) and V                         (max) values were 1.33 mg ml(-1) and 444 μmol min(-1) mg(-1) and 1.17 mg ml(-1) and 196 μmol min(-1) mg(-1) for locust bean gum and konjac flour, respectively. Of all tested metal ions and chemical reagents, Co(2+), Ni(2+), and β-mercaptoethanol enhanced the enzyme activity at 1 mM, whereas other chemicals had no effect on or partially inhibited the enzyme activity. MAN5 was highly resistant to acidic and neutral proteases (trypsin, α-chymotrypsin, collagenase, subtilisin A, and proteinase K). By virtue of the favorable properties of MAN5, it is possible to apply this enzyme in the paper and food industries.",2012,22258646,no
Immunoproteomics based identification of thioredoxin reductase GliT and novel Aspergillus fumigatus antigens for serologic diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.,"There has been a rising incidence of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in critically ill patients, even in the absence of an apparent predisposing immunodeficiency. The diagnosis of IA is difficult because clinical signs are not sensitive and specific, and serum galactomannan has relatively low sensitivity in this group of patients. Therefore, more prompt and accurate disease markers for early diagnosis are needed. To establish disease markers demands a thorough knowledge of fungal antigens which may be detected in the serum or other body fluids of patients. Herein we report novel immunodominant antigens identified from extracellular proteins of Aspergillus fumigatus.Extracellular proteins of A. fumigatus were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and probed with the sera from critically ill patients with proven IA. The immunoreactive protein spots were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF -MS). Forty spots from 2DE gels were detected and 17 different proteins were identified as immunogenic in humans. Function annotation revealed that most of these proteins were metabolic enzymes involved in carbohydrate, fatty acid, amino acid, and energy metabolism. One of the proteins, thioredoxin reductase GliT (TR), which showed the best immunoactivity, was analyzed further for secretory signals, protein localization, and homology. The results indicated that TR is a secretory protein with a signal sequence exhibiting a high probability for secretion. Furthermore, TR did not match any human proteins, and had low homology with most other fungi. The recombinant TR was recognized by the sera of all proven IA patients with different underlying diseases in this study.The immunoreactive proteins identified in this study may be helpful for the diagnosis of IA in critically ill patients. Our results indicate that TR and other immunodominant antigens have potential as biomarkers for the serologic diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.",2012,22251604,no
Resistin-like molecule-α regulates IL-13-induced chemokine production but not allergen-induced airway responses.,"Resistin-like molecule α (Relm-α) is one of the most up-regulated gene products in allergen- and parasite-associated Th2 responses. Localized to alternatively activated macrophages, Relm-α was shown to exert an anti-inflammatory effect in parasite-induced Th2 responses, but its role in experimental asthma remains unexplored. Here, we analyzed the cellular source, the IL-4 receptors required to stimulate Relm-α production, and the role of Relm-α after experimental asthma induction by IL-4, IL-13, or multiple experimental regimes, including ovalbumin and Aspergillus fumigatus immunization. We demonstrate that Relm-α was secreted into the airway lumen, dependent on both the IL-13 receptor-α1 chain and likely the Type I IL-4 receptor, and differentially localized to epithelial cells and myeloid cells, depending on the specific cytokine or aeroallergen trigger. Studies performed with Retnla gene-targeted mice demonstrate that Relm-α was largely redundant in terms of inducing the infiltration of Th2 cytokines, mucus, and inflammatory cells into the lung. These results mirror the dispensable role that other alternatively activated macrophage products (such as arginase 1) have in allergen-induced experimental asthma and contrast with their role in the setting of parasitic infections. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the distinct utilization of IL-4/IL-13 receptors for the induction of Relm-α in the lungs. The differential regulation of Relm-α expression is likely determined by the relative expression levels of IL-4, IL-13, and their corresponding receptors, which are differentially expressed by divergent cells (i.e., epithelial cells and macrophages.) Finally, we identify a largely redundant functional role for Relm-α in acute experimental models of allergen-associated Th2 immune responses.",2012,22246861,no
Prophylactic efficacy of single dose pulmonary administration of amphotericin B inhalation powder in a guinea pig model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.,"Amphotericin B inhalation powder (ABIP) is a novel dry-powder amphotericin B formulation that is directly delivered to the lung, resulting in elevated lung tissue drug concentrations of this polyene. We evaluated the prophylactic efficacy of single dose administration of ABIP in a guinea pig model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.Guinea pigs were immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide and cortisone acetate and challenged with Aspergillus fumigatus conidia in an aerosol chamber. Guinea pigs received prophylaxis with a single inhaled dose of ABIP at 0.05, 0.5, 4 or 10 mg/kg administered 24 h prior to infection. Treatment with oral voriconazole at doses of 5 or 10 mg/kg twice daily beginning 24 h post-challenge served as the positive control.Improvements in survival were observed with ABIP prophylaxis. A single inhaled dose of 4 mg/kg ABIP and treatment with 5 mg/kg voriconazole both improved median and percentage survival compared with untreated controls. In addition, pulmonary fungal burden, as assessed by cfu, quantitative PCR and galactomannan, was also reduced in a dose-dependent fashion with ABIP prophylaxis as well as with both doses of voriconazole treatment.Single-dose prophylaxis with inhaled ABIP as prophylaxis demonstrated a significant survival advantage and reductions in pulmonary fungal burden in this model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Optimization of the dose and dosing frequency of ABIP dose may help to further enhance the anti-Aspergillus activity of this novel amphotericin B formulation.",2012,22240402,no
Fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by Aspergillus arteritis without angiographic abnormalities.,"No source of bleeding is detected by angiogram in 15-20% of patients with nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This negative angiographic finding might suggest a benign prognosis. We describe a case of fatal SAH caused by Aspergillus arteritis without formation of fusiform dilatation or aneurysms. A 76-year-old man with a 2-month history of progressive visual loss due to pachymeningitis around the optic nerves suffered from SAH in the bilateral sylvian fissures. Repetitive serum galactomannan assay and angiography showed no abnormality. Post mortem examination revealed marked proliferation of Aspergillus in the granulomas of the frontal base dura mater. In addition, major trunks and several branches of the bilateral middle cerebral arteries were invaded by Aspergillus hyphae, which destroyed the walls in the absence of dilatation and aneurysms. Invasive aspergillosis of the CNS often forms a mycotic aneurysm. However, four autopsy cases of nonaneurysmal SAH due to invasive aspergillosis have been reported. The present case is the second autopsy case of Aspergillus arteritis without angiographic abnormality, resulting in fatal SAH. Aggressive and continuous antifungal therapy is absolutely necessary in suspected cases of invasive aspergillosis of the CNS, even if angiography is negative and therapeutic markers of aspergillosis are normal.",2013,22239342,no
Breakthrough invasive mould infections in patients treated with caspofungin.,"To describe and estimate the rate of breakthrough invasive mould diseases (IMD) in patients receiving caspofungin.Retrospective, non-interventional study conducted in three University Hospitals.Nineteen breakthrough infections have been identified including 13 aspergillosis, 2 mucormycosis, a fusariosis, a Hormographiella aspergillata infection and 2 possible IMD. Cases were equally distributed between the centres. Fourteen patients had a haematologic malignancy, four were transplant recipients (allogeneic haematopoietic stem cells in three, liver in one) and one had hepatic cirrhosis. Caspofungin has been prescribed as prophylaxis (n = 3), empirical therapy (n = 9) or directed therapy for candidemia (n = 5) or aspergillosis (n = 2). Aspergillus galactomannan was positive in serum or in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in 10 of the 13 aspergillosis. Median duration of caspofungin treatment before breakthrough IMD was 15 days. Nine patients died within twelve weeks. Rate of breakthrough IMD in onco-haematology patients has been estimated to 7.3% for all mould infections and to 4.2% when restricted to documented aspergillosis.Our data call for Aspergillus galactomannan monitoring and close clinical and radiological examination in case of persistence or recurrence of infection signs in high-risk patients receiving caspofungin.",2012,22227384,no
Mannose-binding lectin genotype and serum levels in patients with chronic and allergic pulmonary aspergillosis.,"Several studies suggest mannose-binding lectin (MBL) deficiency is associated with various manifestations of aspergillosis. MBL serum levels and function are genetically determined, but levels rise during inflammation. We address the relative frequency of deficient genotypes, the relationship between serum level and genotype and both age and disease manifestations in patients with chronic pulmonary (CPA) and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and severe asthma with fungal sensitization (SAFS). DNA was extracted from blood samples, and MBL2 genotyping was performed using the INNO-LiPA MBL2 kit. Serum MBL concentrations were determined using ELISA. One hundred and eight patients were evaluated, 70 (65%) with CPA, 38 (35%) with allergic disease (ABPA, SAFS or undefined) and 13 (12%) had both CPA and ABPA. The mean MBL serum level was 1849 μg L(-1) and did not differ between groups. Forty subjects (37%) had exon 1 genotypes producing nonfunctional MBL (A/B, A/C, A/D and O/O), a frequency not different from published normal controls. A/A subjects with CPA had higher levels (2981 μg L(-1)) compared with allergic A/A subjects (2202 μg L(-1)) (pc0.012). No single haplotype, genotype or allele was significantly related to any aspergillosis phenotype. Worse breathlessness was associated with higher MBL levels among A/A subjects (P = 0.009) and conversely nonfunctional genotypes. Mean MBL values were higher in those with an Medical Research Council (MRC) breathlessness score of 5 compared with those with and MRC score of 1 (P = 0.023). A/A allergic subjects (n = 27) in this study were ≈ 11 years younger than allergic A/O subjects (n = 11, P = 0.02). Subjects with worse respiratory status or more severe CPA had higher MBL serum levels (P = 0.023 P = 0.034). Bronchiectasis was not associated with MBL levels in CPA or allergic aspergillosis. MBL genotype and serum level modulate progression of aspergillosis.",2012,22225939,no
Pictorial essay: Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is the best-known allergic manifestation of Aspergillus-related hypersensitivity pulmonary disorders. Most patients present with poorly controlled asthma, and the diagnosis can be made on the basis of a combination of clinical, immunological, and radiological findings. The chest radiographic findings are generally nonspecific, although the manifestations of mucoid impaction of the bronchi suggest a diagnosis of ABPA. High-resolution CT scan (HRCT) of the chest has replaced bronchography as the initial investigation of choice in ABPA. HRCT of the chest can be normal in almost one-third of the patients, and at this stage it is referred to as serologic ABPA (ABPA-S). The importance of central bronchiectasis (CB) as a specific finding in ABPA is debatable, as almost 40% of the lobes are involved by peripheral bronchiectasis. High-attenuation mucus (HAM), encountered in 20% of patients with ABPA, is pathognomonic of ABPA. ABPA should be classified based on the presence or absence of HAM as ABPA-S (mild), ABPA-CB (moderate), and ABPA-CB-HAM (severe), as this classification not only reflects immunological severity but also predicts the risk of recurrent relapses.",2012,22223932,no
Invasive mycoses: diagnostic challenges.,"Despite the availability of newer antifungal drugs, outcomes for patients with invasive fungal infections (IFIs) continue to be poor, in large part due to delayed diagnosis and initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy. Standard histopathologic diagnostic techniques are often untenable in at-risk patients, and culture-based diagnostics typically are too insensitive or nonspecific, or provide results after too long a delay for optimal IFI management. Newer surrogate markers of IFIs with improved sensitivity and specificity are needed to enable earlier diagnosis and, ideally, to provide prognostic information and/or permit therapeutic monitoring. Surrogate assays should also be accessible and easy to implement in the hospital. Several nonculture-based assays of newer surrogates are making their way into the medical setting or are currently under investigation. These new or up-and-coming surrogates include antigens/antibodies (mannan and antimannan antibodies) or fungal metabolites (d-arabinitol) for detection of invasive candidiasis, the Aspergillus cell wall component galactomannan used to detect invasive aspergillosis, or the fungal cell wall component and panfungal marker β-glucan. In addition, progress continues with use of polymerase chain reaction- or other nucleic acid- or molecular-based assays for diagnosis of either specific or generic IFIs, although the various methods must be better standardized before any of these approaches can be more fully implemented into the medical setting. Investigators are also beginning to explore the possibility of combining newer surrogate markers with each other or with more standard diagnostic approaches to improve sensitivity, specificity, and capacity for earlier diagnosis, at a time when fungal burden is still relatively low and more responsive to antifungal therapy.",2012,22196205,no
Cross-reactivity of Aspergillus galactomannan in an HIV-infected patient with histoplasmosis.,"Non-invasive assays are increasingly being used in patients with suspected fungal infections. Limitations to these tests include limited sensitivity, specificity, and cross reactivity with other fungal pathogens.

This test may have a role in the evaluation of patients with suspected histoplasmosis in settings where Histoplasma antigen testing is not widely available. ",2012,24371756,no
Determination of aflatoxins in nuts of Tabriz confectionaries by ELISA and HPLC methods.,"Aflatoxins (AFs) are a group of mycotoxins and secondary metabolites of various species of Aspergillus. There are various forms of aflatoxins including B1, B2, G1, G2, M1 and M2 types. Aflatoxins cause important health problems and have high potential effect on liver cancer. Therefore, numerous investigations have been conducted during last three decades. The aim of this work is to determine the contamination levels of nuts used by the confectionaries in Tabriz.A total of 142 samples including 35 almond , 26 walnut, 4 seeds of apricot, 6 sunflower seeds kernel, 6 sesame seed, 6 peanuts , 32 pistachio,13 hazelnuts and 14 cashews samples were collected from Tabriz confectionaries. The ELISA method was employed for the screening of total aflatoxins.In 13 cases (28.1% of pistachios, 5.1% of walnuts and 7.1% of cashews) contamination rate of higher than 15 ppb were observed. The HPLC method was applied for the confirmation of ELISA results. Aflatoxin B1 was the highest detected AFs.The overall results of the tested samples indicated that the rate of contamination of pistachios is higher than the other tested samples.",2012,24312781,no
A near fatal case of invasive aspergillosis.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) rarely presents with endobronchial nodules or pseudomembranes on bronchoscopy. We describe a case of invasive aspergillosis in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), in which a fungal etiology was suspected after visualization of scattered, white endobronchial nodules.A 36-year-old-female with history of SLE developed cardiorespiratory shock. Bronchoscopy indicated the presence of endobronchial lesions, and serologic studies were consistent with IA. Given high index of suspicion for fungal disease in an immunocompromised host, empiric antifungals were discontinued and voriconazole initiation resulted in a successful therapy.This case highlights the importance of a high index of suspicion for fungal diseases, especially among critically ill hosts with endobronchial lesions, who develop rapid cardio-respiratory impairment. Failure to recognize endobronchial patterns of fungal infection may lead to treatment delay and adverse clinical outcomes.",2012,23569520,no
[Invasive fungal disease: conventional or molecular mycological diagnosis?].,"Diagnosis of invasive mycoses is a difficult challenge due to the limitations and low sensitivity of traditional microbiology methods which lead to diagnostic and therapeutic delays. The aim of this review is to summarise the state of the art of the molecular diagnosis of invasive fungal disease and to clarify its current role in the clinical practice. Conventional microbiological methods could be complemented with molecular methods in the rapid and definitive identification of fungal isolates. Biomarkers (β-glucan, galactomannan) are very useful in immunocompromised patients and have been included as probable invasive mycoses by the EORTC/MSG. Nucleic acid detection is currently used as a complementary tool for diagnosis. However, PCR can be very useful in mould invasive mycoses. Finally, the combined detection using biomarkers can improve the diagnosis. However, their applicability in the microbiology laboratory is not so easy and further studies are required for the appropriate evaluation of its clinical usefulness.",2013,22206948,no
Cross-reactivity of Fusarium spp. in the Aspergillus Galactomannan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.,Nine of 11 hematological patients with disseminated/deep-seated Fusarium infection tested at least twice for Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) had repeated positive results in the absence of Aspergillus isolation in culture. The centrifuged supernatants of 12 Fusarium isolates were tested by a GM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA). All the isolates produced positive reactions when tested undiluted. These results show cross-reactivity of Fusarium spp. with Aspergillus GM that may constitute a drawback with respect to the specificity of the Platelia EIA.,2012,22205818,no
Effects of pretreating serum samples on the performance of a latex agglutination test for serodiagnosis of paracoccidioidomycosis.,"Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a fungal disease caused by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, and Brazil is one of the principal countries where it is endemic. Diagnosis is based on the observation of budding P. brasiliensis yeast in clinical specimens from patients however, the sensitivity of the visualization of fungi is low, indicating that serological tests are used for early diagnosis. The double-immunodiffusion test (ID) is the ""gold standard"" test for serology in PCM, although the execution of this test requires the availability of laboratorial infrastructure. We report the improved performance of a latex agglutination test (LAT) by pretreating 30 serum samples from PCM patients and 71 controls (histoplasmosis and aspergillosis patients, patients with bacterial infections, and normal human sera) with a dilution buffer incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The sensitivity and specificity of the LAT test in the nonpretreated samples were 73% and 79%, respectively. However, when samples were pretreated, the sensitivity and specificity of the test increased to 90%. In this study, we did not observe cross-reactivity with histoplasmosis patient sera, but some reactions to sera from patients with aspergillosis and bacterial infections were noted. Normal human sera were not reactive in our tests. These results indicate the need for the elimination of heterologous reactions so that we can adequately use this method for screening cases of PCM.",2012,22205661,no
Indoor exposure to mould allergens.,"Humid indoor environments may be colonised by allergenic filamentous microfungi (moulds), Aspergillus spp., Penicillium spp., Cladosporium spp., and Alternaria spp. in particular. Mould-induced respiratory diseases are a worldwide problem. In the last two decades, mould allergens and glucans have been used as markers of indoor exposure to moulds. Recently, mould allergens Alt a 1 (Alternaria alternata) and Asp f 1 (Aspergillus fumigatus) have been analysed in various environments (residential and occupational) with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, which use monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. Household Alt a 1 and Asp f 1 levels were usually under the limit of the method detection. By contrast, higher levels of mould allergens were found in environments with high levels of bioaerosols such as poultry farms and sawmills. Data on allergen Alt a 1 and Asp f 1 levels in agricultural settings may provide information on possible colonisation of respective moulds and point out to mould-related diseases in occupants.",2012,22202471,no
"Detection and measurement of fungal burden in a guinea pig model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis by novel quantitative nested real-time PCR compared with galactomannan and (1,3)-β-D-glucan detection.","We developed and assessed the diagnostic value of a novel quantitative nested real-time (QNRT) PCR assay targeting the internal transcribed spacer region of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in a guinea pig model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Groups of 5 immunosuppressed animals that were infected using an aerosol chamber with Aspergillus fumigatus conidia were humanely terminated 1 h postinoculation and at days 3, 5, 7, and 11 postchallenge, and lung tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, whole blood, and serum samples were collected. The QNRT PCR results obtained with the serum and BAL fluid were compared to those achieved with galactomannan and (1→3)-β-d-glucan assays. High fungal burden levels were detected by QNRT PCR in both lung tissue and BAL fluid in all infected animals at each time point, and the sensitivity of each assay in BAL fluid was 100% by day 3 and remained so through the remainder of the study. The sensitivity of detection of fungi in whole blood and serum samples was significantly lower, and some samples remained negative by all three assays despite the advanced stage of the infection. From these data, we can conclude that this novel QNRT PCR method was highly sensitive for the detection of A. fumigatus from different types of samples in this model. In addition, BAL fluid samples appeared to be the most suitable for the early diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. When testing serum, the use of a combination of available assays may increase the possibility of early detection of this opportunistic mycosis.",2012,22189110,no

Prospective evaluation of clinical and biological markers to predict the outcome of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in hematological patients.,"Early evaluation of treatment efficacy in invasive aspergillosis (IA), a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in hematological patients, remains a challenge. We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the performance of different markers in predicting the outcome of patients with IA. Both clinical and biological criteria were assessed 7, 14, 21, and 45 days after inclusion in the study, and mortality was assessed at day 60. The association between baseline data and their evolution and the day 45 response to treatment was analyzed. A total of 57 patients (4 with proven, 44 with probable, and 9 with possible aspergillosis according to the revised EORTC/MSG [European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group] definitions) were included. At day 45, 30 patients (53%) were determined to be responders, 25 (44%) were nonresponders, and 2 were not able to be evaluated. Twenty patients died within the 60 days of follow-up. We found that a poor day 45 outcome was associated with patients who had high baseline serum galactomannan (GM) antigen levels and those receiving steroids at the time of IA. A consistently negative serum GM index was associated with a good outcome, and the day 14 clinical evaluation was predictive of the day 45 outcome. No association was found between Aspergillus antibodies or DNA detection and patients' outcome. We conclude that the GM index value at diagnosis of IA, GM index kinetics, and clinical evaluation at day 14 are good markers for predicting the outcome of patients with IA and should be taken into account for adapting antifungal treatment.",2012,22170907,no
Evaluation of a recombinant antigen-based enzyme immunoassay for the diagnosis of noninvasive aspergillosis.,"Antibody detection is a key diagnostic tool for noninvasive aspergillosis (NIA) such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and chronic pulmonary aspergillosis.

FRET-based quantum dot immunoassay for rapid and sensitive detection of Aspergillus amstelodami.,"In this study, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based quantum dot (QD) immunoassay for detection and identification of Aspergillus amstelodami was developed. Biosensors were formed by conjugating QDs to IgG antibodies and incubating with quencher-labeled analytes QD energy was transferred to the quencher species through FRET, resulting in diminished fluorescence from the QD donor. During a detection event, quencher-labeled analytes are displaced by higher affinity target analytes, creating a detectable fluorescence signal increase from the QD donor. Conjugation and the resulting antibody:QD ratios were characterized with UV-Vis spectroscopy and QuantiT protein assay. The sensitivity of initial fluorescence experiments was compromised by inherent autofluorescence of mold spores, which produced low signal-to-noise and inconsistent readings. Therefore, excitation wavelength, QD, and quencher were adjusted to provide optimal signal-to-noise over spore background. Affinities of anti-Aspergillus antibody for different mold species were estimated with sandwich immunoassays, which identified A. fumigatus and A. amstelodami for use as quencher-labeled- and target-analytes, respectively. The optimized displacement immunoassay detected A. amstelodami concentrations as low as 10(3) spores/mL in five minutes or less. Additionally, baseline fluorescence was produced in the presence of 10(5) CFU/mL heat-killed E. coli O157:H7, demonstrating high specificity.

Overall, these FRET-based QD-antibody biosensors represent a significant advancement in detection capabilities, offering sensitive and reliable detection of targets with applications in areas from biological terrorism defense to clinical analysis.",2012,22163961,no
Cloning and expression of hemicellulases from Aspergillus nidulans in Pichia pastoris.,"The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is increasingly used for heterologous expression of high quality proteins in laboratory-scale (milligram) quantities. Commercially available polysaccharide-active enzyme preparations have limited applications in plant cell wall research due to their heterogeneous mix of hydrolytic activities. P. pastoris provides an ideal in vitro expression system for producing monocomponent enzymes, since it lacks endogenous plant cell wall-active enzymes and can perform eukaryotic post-translational modifications (i.e., glycosylation). We have routinely prepared cDNA constructs from Aspergillus nidulans encoding a broad array of hydrolases active on various linkages contained in plant cell wall polysaccharides. The cDNAs were inserted into the pPICZα C shuttle vector (Invitrogen) in-frame with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae α-secretion factor and expressed under the transcriptional control of the highly inducible alcohol oxidase 1 (AOX1) promoter. The enzyme products were efficiently secreted into buffered complex methanol medium (BMMY) as C-terminal his-tagged proteins for simple one-step affinity purification. The insertion of the c-Myc epitope enabled easy immunodetection. Here we present the detailed protocols for primer design, cloning, expression, and activity assays for a representative set of xylan-acting hemicellulases produced in P. pastoris.",2012,22160911,no
Development of monoclonal antibodies to recombinant terrelysin and characterization of expression in Aspergillus terreus.,"Aspergillus terreus is an emerging pathogen that mostly affects immunocompromised patients, causing infections that are often difficult to manage therapeutically. Current diagnostic strategies are limited to the detection of fungal growth using radiological methods or biopsy, which often does not enable species-specific identification. There is thus a critical need for diagnostic techniques to enable early and specific identification of the causative agent. In this study, we describe monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) developed to a previously described recombinant form of the haemolysin terrelysin. Sixteen hybridomas of various IgG isotypes were generated to the recombinant protein, of which seven demonstrated reactivity to the native protein in hyphal extracts. Cross-reactivity analysis using hyphal extracts from 29 fungal species, including 12 Aspergillus species and five strains of A. terreus, showed that three mAbs (13G10, 15B5 and 10G4) were A. terreus-specific. Epitope analysis demonstrated mAbs 13G10 and 10G4 recognize the same epitope, PSNEFE, while mAb 15B5 recognizes the epitope LYEGQFHS. Time-course studies showed that terrelysin expression was highest during early hyphal growth and dramatically decreased after mycelial expansion. Immunolocalization studies demonstrated that terrelysin was not only localized within the cytoplasm of hyphae but appeared to be more abundant at the hyphal tip. These findings were confirmed in cultures grown at room temperature as well as at 37 °C. Additionally, terrelysin was detected in the supernatant of A. terreus cultures. These observations suggest that terrelysin may be a candidate biomarker for A. terreus infection.",2012,22160315,no
Clinical utility and prognostic value of galactomannan in neutropenic patients with invasive aspergillosis.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in profoundly neutropenic patients. Delayed diagnosis and therapy may lead to poor outcomes.The objective of this study was to assess the performance characteristics of the galactomannan (GM) assay in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens for the diagnosis of IA in neutropenic patients with hematological malignancies. We also evaluated the prognostic outcome.A total of 1198 serum samples and 42 BAL from 235 neutropenic patients were tested with a GM elisa platelia test. We used Cox modeling of time to 6- and 12-week mortality for GM level at the time of diagnosis (GM0) and GM decay in the week following diagnosis in proven and probable IA patients with more than two GM values.There were three proven, 55 probable, and four possible cases of IA. The sensitivity and specificity of the GM test were 96.8% and 82.4% respectively. In BAL samples, sensitivity was 86% and the specificity 93%. BAL GM was more sensitive than microscopy (22.2%) and BAL culture (38.9%). Among patients with proven/probable IA, serum and BAL GM were in agreement for 92.8% of paired samples. The hazard ratio (HR) of GM0 and 1-week GM decay per unit increase in Aspergillus enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was 1.044 (95% CI, 0.738 to 1.476) and 0.709 (95% CI, 0.236 to 2.130) respectively.We found good correlation between the GM0 and GM decay combination and outcome of IA patients. The GM is a useful tool for diagnosis and monitoring of IA.",2013,22154334,no
False positive galactomannan Platelia due to piperacillin-tazobactam.,"Invasive aspergillosis is a serious disease, the lethality of which is important among hematology patients. Early diagnosis is crucial for treatment options and the prognosis. Detection of the antigen galactomannan is the most frequently used microbiological tools. But galactomannan detection may be falsely positive, and this false positivity has been associated with piperacillin-tazobactam treatment, the main antibiotic combination used in clinical hematology.The purpose of our study, carried out from January 2009 to December 2010 at the Versailles hospital on in-patients with hematological disorders, was to evaluate the association between false galactomannan positivity and administration of piperacillin-tazobactam, and to study a possible variability of products issued by three manufacturers.We noted that 207 patients were included (n=207), accounting for 69 false positive and 138 true negative results. The intrinsic galactomannan values in the study were sensitivity 100%, specificity 68%, positive and negative predictive values respectively 16%, 100%, and a likelihood positive and negative test at respectively 3.12, and 0.The statistical analysis did not determine any association between false positivity in galactomannan and piperacillin-tazobactam issued by two manufacturers (P=0.87 and P=0.94). But, there was a significant association between false galactomannan positivity and piperacillin-tazobactam issued by the third manufacturer (P=0.02). Four of the 25 batches issued by this manufacturer were tested and negative ""in vitro"" for galactomannan.This study results suggest that the association between false galactomannan positivity and piperacillin-tazobactam is not longer systematic, but can still prevail depending on the manufacturers. It also confirmed the positive contribution of testing piperacillin-tazobactam batches ""in vitro"" before using the antibiotic.",2012,22153703,no
Invasive fungal infections in renal transplant recipients.,"Invasive fungal infections are a significant and often lethal problem in transplant patients. Infections caused by geographically limited endemic fungi are infrequent, and Aspergillus species, Mucorales species, Candida species, and Cryptococcus neoformans are the opportunistic fungi responsible for most such infections. The symptoms of systemic fungal infections are nonspecific, particularly in their early stages. The high rates of mortality and graft loss owing to fungal infections render early diagnosis and treatment imperative in immunosuppressed patients. Current methods for the diagnosis of systemic fungal infections include imaging procedures, endoscopic methods and biopsies, microscopic and culture techniques, antibody and antigen-based serologic testing, and the detection (via polymerase chain reaction) of fungal deoxyribonucleic acid in blood or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, as well as the careful analysis of signs and symptoms. Antifungal therapy should be initiated early in patients with a suspected fungal infection (even before laboratory findings have confirmed that diagnosis) and should be administered with appropriate adjustment of immunosuppressive regimens. To manage fungal infections in patients with renal failure, optimizing the pharmacokinetics of antifungal drugs to reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity is crucial.",2012,22142041,no
Combined therapy of voriconazole and anidulafungin in murine infections by Aspergillus flavus.,"The efficacy of the combination of anidulafungin (AFG) at 1 mg/kg plus voriconazole (VRC) at 25 mg/kg was evaluated in a murine model of disseminated infection by Aspergillus flavus using three isolates previously tested in vitro. All the combinations showed indifferent in vitro interaction with the exception of one, which showed synergy. In general, the combined treatment prolonged the survival and reduced the fungal load in comparison with AFG alone, and only in a few cases, it improved the results of the VRC monotherapy. The combination of the two drugs and VRC alone reduced the galactomannan levels in serum in comparison with the control group.",2012,22139415,no
"Characterization of blood beta-1,3-glucan and anti-beta-glucan antibody in hemodialysis patients using culinary-medicinal Royal Sun Agaricus, Agaricus brasiliensis S. Wasser et al. (Agaricomycetideae).","Beta-glucan is a major component of fungal cell walls and shows various immunopharmacological activities including antitumor activity. Previously, we detected anti-beta-glucan antibody in human sera. Anti-beta-glucan antibody participates in the immune response to fungal cell wall beta-glucan. Patients on dialysis are at high risk of infection including fungal infections. We examined the plasma beta-glucan level and the titer of anti-beta-glucan antibody in dialysis patients. We measured plasma beta-1,3-glucan concentrations with the limulus G test and anti-beta-glucan antibody titers by ELISA with Candida beta-glucan-coated plates. We also examined the influence of the period of dialysis and the kind of dialysis membrane. The patients were positive for beta-1,3-glucan in their plasma. The anti-beta-glucan antibody titer was lower in the dialysis patients than in healthy volunteers. Long-term dialysis patients showed lower anti-beta-glucan antibody titers than short-term dialysis patients. No significant difference was found between the kinds of dialysis membrane. The titer of anti-beta-glucan antibody as recognition molecule of beta-glucan was low in dialysis patients compared with healthy volunteers. This is likely to be one factor explaining the sensitivity to infection of the dialysis patients. An appropriate application of culinary-medicinal mushroom such as Agaricus brasiliensis has potential for the prevention of fungal infection in dialysis patients.",2012,22135885,no
"Production of prostaglandins, isoprostanes and thromboxane by Aspergillus fumigatus: identification by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and quantification by enzyme immunoassay.","Aspergillus fumigatus has been reported to produce prostaglandin (PG)-like substances. The molecular structure of these fungal eicosanoids is however still unknown. By using the gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) methodology we identified a number of eicosanoids that were formed upon incubation of the precursor arachidonic acid ethyl ester (AAE, 10 μM) with three strains of A. fumigatus. The eicosanoids identified include the prostaglandins (PG) PGE(2), 6-keto-PGF(1α) (the stable hydrolysis product of prostacyclin PGI(2)) and PGF(2α), the isoprostanes 15(S)-8-iso-PGF(2α) and 15(S)-8-iso-PGE(2), and thromboxane B(2) (TxB(2), the stable hydrolysis product of TxA(2)). These eicosanoids are identical with those produced by cyclooxygenases (COX) in humans. The biosynthesis of all of these eicosanoids could not be inhibited by the human COX inhibitors indomethacin (100 μM), acetylsalicylic acid (100 μM) or the non-selective human lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid (100 μM). By contrast, the selen-containing antioxidant ebselen (100 μM) was found to inhibit their synthesis. Our results suggest that mammals and fungi employ different eicosanoid biosynthesis pathways. As some of the detected eicosanoids are potent immunomodulators and bronchoconstrictors, they could play a possible role in pulmonary diseases associated with A. fumigatus infection.",2012,22118804,no
Genetically-determined hyperfunction of the S100B/RAGE axis is a risk factor for aspergillosis in stem cell transplant recipients.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a major threat to the successful outcome of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), although individual risk varies considerably. Recent evidence has established a pivotal role for a danger sensing mechanism implicating the S100B/receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) axis in antifungal immunity. The association of selected genetic variants in the S100B/RAGE axis with susceptibility to IA was investigated in 223 consecutive patients undergoing HSCT. Furthermore, studies addressing the functional consequences of these variants were performed. Susceptibility to IA was significantly associated with two distinct polymorphisms in RAGE (-374T/A) and S100B (+427C/T) genes, the relative contribution of each depended on their presence in both transplantation counterparts [patient SNP(RAGE), adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 1.97 P = 0.042 and donor SNP(RAGE), HR, 2.03",2012,22114731,no
In vivo roles of the basic domain of dynactin p150 in microtubule plus-end tracking and dynein function.,"Microtubule (MT) plus-end-tracking proteins accumulate at MT plus ends for various cellular functions, but their targeting mechanisms are not fully understood (Akhmanova A and Steinmetz MO. Tracking the ends: a dynamic protein network controls the fate of microtubule tips. Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol 20089:309-322.). Here, we tested in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans the requirement for plus-end localization of dynactin p150, a protein essential for dynein function. Deletion of the N-terminal MT-binding region of p150 significantly diminishes the MT plus-end accumulation of both dynein heavy chain and p150, and causes a partial defect in nuclear distribution. Surprisingly, within the MT-binding region, the basic domain is more critical than the CAP-Gly (cytoskeleton-associated protein glycine-rich) domain for maintaining plus-end tracking of p150, as well as for the functions of dynein in nuclear distribution and early endosome movement. Our results show that the basic domain of A. nidulans p150 is important for p150-MT interaction both in vivo and in vitro, and the basic amino acids within this domain are crucial for the plus-end accumulation of p150 in the wild-type background and for the p150-MT interaction in the ΔkinA (kinesin-1) background. We suggest that the basic amino acids are required for the electrostatic interaction between p150 and MTs, which is important for kinesin-1-mediated plus-end targeting of dynactin and dynein in A. nidulans.",2012,22106867,no
Arabidopsis lysin-motif proteins LYM1 LYM3 CERK1 mediate bacterial peptidoglycan sensing and immunity to bacterial infection.,"Recognition of microbial patterns by host pattern recognition receptors is a key step in immune activation in multicellular eukaryotes. Peptidoglycans (PGNs) are major components of bacterial cell walls that possess immunity-stimulating activities in metazoans and plants. Here we show that PGN sensing and immunity to bacterial infection in Arabidopsis thaliana requires three lysin-motif (LysM) domain proteins. LYM1 and LYM3 are plasma membrane proteins that physically interact with PGNs and mediate Arabidopsis sensitivity to structurally different PGNs from gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. lym1 and lym3 mutants lack PGN-induced changes in transcriptome activity patterns, but respond to fungus-derived chitin, a pattern structurally related to PGNs, in a wild-type manner. Notably, lym1, lym3, and lym3 lym1 mutant genotypes exhibit supersusceptibility to infection with virulent Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato DC3000. Defects in basal immunity in lym3 lym1 double mutants resemble those observed in lym1 and lym3 single mutants, suggesting that both proteins are part of the same recognition system. We further show that deletion of CERK1, a LysM receptor kinase that had previously been implicated in chitin perception and immunity to fungal infection in Arabidopsis, phenocopies defects observed in lym1 and lym3 mutants, such as peptidoglycan insensitivity and enhanced susceptibility to bacterial infection. Altogether, our findings suggest that plants share with metazoans the ability to recognize bacterial PGNs. However, as Arabidopsis LysM domain proteins LYM1, LYM3, and CERK1 form a PGN recognition system that is unrelated to metazoan PGN receptors, we propose that lineage-specific PGN perception systems have arisen through convergent evolution.",2012,22106285,no
Association between indoor fungi in Delhi homes and sensitization in children with respiratory allergy.,"Indoor fungi are potential sensitizing agents in children and their detection and quantification in indoor air are important in the diagnosis and environmental management of fungal allergies. The objective of this investigation was to assess the prevalence of fungal allergies in children in Delhi and to study the association between mold counts in the homes of children and their sensitization to respective fungal extracts. Fungal concentrations and seasonality were studied at two-week intervals for one year using Andersen Volumetric and Burkard Slide samplers. Sensitization to fungi frequently encountered in patients' homes was assessed by Skin Prick Tests (SPTs). Total fungal specific IgE was measured by ELISA in the sera of patients positive to fungal extracts. Skin Prick Tests revealed that 39.3% (33/84) of patients were markedly positive (2 + and above) to one or the other fungal allergens. Raised serum IgE to predominant indoor fungal species was observed in patients with marked SPT results. Highest marked skin reactivity (2 + and above) was obtained with Alternaria alternata allergens in 17.9% of the children, which was followed by the response to fungal antigens of Aspergillus fumigatus and Penicillium citrinum (15.5%). Exposure to high fungal counts of some dominant fungi (Penicillium, A. nidulans and A. fumigatus) was found associated with increased fungal sensitization in the patients. Total serum IgE level was revealed to be significantly linked with the intensity of skin reactions, as well as with skin index (r(2) = 0.052 P < 0.05). We concluded that children in Delhi are exposed to high concentrations of fungi in the indoor environment and that respiratory allergies were connected with higher prevalence of skin sensitization.",2012,22103346,no
False-positive Aspergillus galactomannan assay in solid organ transplant recipients with histoplasmosis.,"Post-transplantation histoplasmosis may be acquired via inhalation, may result from endogenous reactivation, or may be derived from the allograft. The Histoplasma and Aspergillus enzyme-linked immunoassays are increasingly being relied upon for rapid diagnosis of fungal infections, especially in immunocompromised patients. We describe 4 cases of solid organ transplant recipients who had histoplasmosis and a falsely positive Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) obtained from the serum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. We also report our experience, testing for Histoplasma antigen (Ag) in specimens positive for Aspergillus GM. From January 2007 through December 2010, of 2432 unique patients who had positive Aspergillus GM tests, 514 (21%) were tested for Histoplasma Ag, and 27 were found to be positive. Most specimens that tested positive for both Aspergillus and Histoplasma were obtained by BAL. False-positive tests for Aspergillus GM can occur in immunosuppressed patients who have histoplasmosis, and may obscure the correct diagnosis.",2012,22093368,no
Increased chitinase expression and fungal-specific antibodies in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of asthmatic children.,"Increasing evidence highlights the contribution of chitinases and fungal infection to the development of asthma.The purpose of this study was to characterize chitinase expression and serological markers of fungal infection in children with severe asthma.Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected from children undergoing clinically indicated flexible bronchoscopy. A diagnosis of asthma was confirmed by pulmonary function testing. BALF was tested for chitinase activity and YKL-40 (an enzymatically inactive chitinase) concentrations. Specimens were cultured for fungal organisms and tested for cryptococcal antigen by ELISA. IgG and IgA reactivity to whole extract fungal (Aspergillus fumigatus, Alternaria alternata, Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans) proteins were determined by immunoblot assay.Among the 37 patients studied, 30 were asthmatic and 7 were non-asthmatic. Asthmatics exhibited elevated serum IgE levels (median: 748 IU/mL, IQR: 219-1765 IU/mL). Chitinase activity was greater in the BALF of asthmatics (mean, 0.85 ± 1.2 U/mL) compared with non-asthmatics (mean: 0.23 ± 0.21 U/mL, P = 0.012). Likewise YKL-40 concentrations were higher in the BALF of asthmatics and correlated with chitinase activity. There was a trend towards increased fungal-specific IgG in the BALF of asthmatics compared with non-asthmatics and for C. albicans this difference reached statistical significance. IgA reactivity to C. neoformans and A. fumigatus was greater in the BALF of asthmatics compared with non-asthmatics.Compared with non-asthmatics, asthmatic children exhibited increased chitinase activity and increased YKL-40 levels in BALF. Increased IgG and IgA reactivity to fungal proteins in the BALF of asthmatics may reflect a local response to fungal infection. Our findings are consistent with and suggest a role for chitinases in asthma pathogenesis among Bronx children and provide serological evidence of an association between fungal infection and severe asthma.",2012,22092749,no
Diagnosis of invasive fungal disease using serum (1→3)-β-D-glucan: a bivariate meta-analysis.,"The (1→3)-β-D-Glucan (BG) assay has been approved for diagnosing invasive fungal disease (IFD). However, the test performance has been variable. We conducted a meta-analysis to determine the overall accuracy of BG assay for diagnosing IFD.The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios (PLR and NLR, respectively) of BG for diagnosing IFD were pooled using a bivariate meta-analysis. We also performed subgroup analyses.Twelve reports, including 15 studies, were included for the analysis (proven and probable IFD vs possible or no IFD). The sensitivity, specificity, PLR and NLR were 0.76 (95% CI, 0.67-0.83), 0.85 (95% CI, 0.73-0.92), 5.05 (95% CI, 2.71-9.43), and 0.28 (95% CI, 0.20-0.39), respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the BG assay had higher specificities for patients with hematological disorders and a positive BG result with two consecutive samples. The combination of galactomannan and BG increased the specificity value to 0.98 (95% CI, 0.95-0.99) for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis.Serum BG determination is clinically useful for diagnosing IFD in at-risk patients, especially for hematology patients. The combination of galactomannan and BG was sufficient for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis. Since the BG assay is not absolutely sensitive and specific for IFD, the BG results should be interpreted in parallel with clinical findings.",2012,22082890,no
Musculoskeletal coccidioidomycosis.,"Coccidioidomycosis (valley fever) is a systemic fungal infection caused by soil fungi, Coccidioides species, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This infection is endemic in northern Mexico, the southwestern United States, and parts of Central and South America. The risk factors include ethnicity (especially African and Pacific Island ancestry), male gender, and immunosuppression. The primary infection occurs in lungs, but fewer than 40% of patients are symptomatic. Fewer than 1% of infections result in disseminated disease, which may involve any organ. Skeletal infection occurs in 10 to 50% of these patients and is frequently multicentric with axial skeleton involvement. The diagnosis can be confirmed by culture of the organism or visual detection from cytological or histological specimens obtained from sites of disease. A presumptive diagnosis can be made in patients with a compatible illness and a positive serologic test. Imaging plays a significant role in diagnosis and follow-up treatment of musculoskeletal coccidioidomycosis and includes radiography, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and bone scintigraphy. Skeletal coccidioidomycosis is difficult to treat and frequently requires a combination of medical therapy and surgical debridement. Medical therapy must be continued for a prolonged period of time, potentially for a lifetime in some patients.",2012,22081286,no
Iliopsoas abscess caused by Aspergillus fumigatus complicated by pulmonary aspergillosis.,"We report a case of iliopsoas abscess caused by Aspergillus fumigatus with pulmonary complications. A 60-year-old man was admitted to the Showa University Hospital Department of Gastroenterology with fulminant hepatitis B on April 14, 2010, and treated with steroids. Although fulminant hepatitis B was improved by steroid and symptomatic therapy, he developed a fever on hospital day 39. The chest X-ray film showed a nodular lesion in the right middle-lower lung field, and both the (1 → 3)-β-D: -glucan and Candida mannan antigen tests were positive. The β-D: -glucan level increased despite treatment with fluconazole and other drugs, including low-dose micafungin. Abdominal computed tomography showed a low-density area in the right iliopsoas muscle. He was then referred to the Department of Clinical Infectious Diseases. A. fumigatus was isolated from the iliopsoas lesion and the pulmonary lesion after specimens were obtained by aspiration and bronchofiberscopy, respectively, leading to a diagnosis of fungal iliopsoas abscess. Steroid therapy was tapered early, the abscess was drained, and the micafungin dose was increased. This treatment led to improvement of the fever, inflammatory reaction, β-D: -glucan level, and lesions of the lung and iliopsoas muscle. In preparation for discharge, treatment was changed to voriconazole (parenteral → per oral) followed by itraconazole (per oral). His clinical course was satisfactory, and there was no recurrence after antifungal therapy was stopped. We conclude that after invasive pulmonary aspergillosis developed, A. fumigatus spread hematogenously to create an extremely rare iliopsoas abscess. The β-D: -glucan level closely reflected the response to treatment and was useful for follow-up.",2013,22080203,no
Candida colonization index in patients admitted to an ICU.,"Multiple-site colonization with Candida spp. is commonly recognized as a risk factor for invasive fungal infection in critically ill patients. We carried out a study to determine the relationship between Candida colonization and invasive infection in neurological patients admitted to an ICU. At admission (T0) and every three days for two weeks, different samples (pharynx swab, tracheal secretions, stomach contents, etc.) were collected for mycological surveillance. Candida mannan antigen and Candida anti-mannan antibodies were assayed. The Colonization Index (CI) and Corrected Colonization Index were calculated for each time point. Of all patients 70% was already colonized by Candida spp. at T0 and six of them had CI ≥ 0.5. Three patients developed candidemia they had CI ≥ 0.5 before infection. Positive values of Candida mannan antigen and anti-mannan antibodies were found only in the patients with candidemia. The sensitivity and specificity of the Candida mannan test were 66.6% and 100%, respectively, while the sensitivity and specificity of the anti-mannan antibody test were 100%. In accordance with other authors, we find the surveillance cultures are useful to monitor the Candida colonization in ICU patients. In addition, the sequential observation of anti-mannan antibodies could contribute to early diagnosis of candidiasis more than Candida mannan antigen in immunocompetent patients.",2011,22072934,no
Aflatoxin toxicity reduction in feed by enhanced binding to surface-modified clay additives.,"Animal feeding studies have demonstrated that clay additives, such as bentonites, can bind aflatoxins in ingested feed and reduce or eliminate the toxicity. Bentonite deposits are found throughout the world and mostly consist of expandable smectite minerals, such as montmorillonite. The surfaces of smectite minerals can be treated with organic compounds to create surface-modified clays that more readily bind some contaminants than the untreated clay. Montmorillonites treated with organic cations, such as hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA) and phenyltrimethylammonium (PTMA), more effectively remove organic contaminants, such as benzene and toluene, from water than untreated clay. Similarly, montmorillonite treated with PTMA (K(d) = 24,100) retained more aflatoxin B1 (AfB1) from aqueous corn flour than untreated montmorillonite (K(d) = 944). Feed additives that reduced aflatoxin toxicity in animal feeding studies adsorbed more AfB1 from aqueous corn flour than feed additives that were less effective. The organic cations HDTMA and PTMA are considered toxic and would not be suitable for clay additives used in feed or food, but other non-toxic or nutrient compounds can be used to prepare surface-modified clays. Montmorillonite (SWy) treated with choline (K(d) = 13,800) and carnitine (K(d) = 3960) adsorbed much more AfB1 from aqueous corn flour than the untreated clay (K(d) = 944). A choline-treated clay prepared from a reduced-charge, high-charge montmorillonite (K(d) = 20,100) adsorbed more AfB1 than the choline-treated high-charge montmorillonite (K(d) = 1340) or the untreated montmorillonite (K(d) = 293). Surface-modified clay additives prepared using low-charge smectites and nutrient or non-toxic organic compounds might be used to more effectively bind aflatoxins in contaminated feed or food and prevent toxicity.",2011,22069725,no
Pharmacodynamic effects of simulated standard doses of antifungal drugs against Aspergillus species in a new in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model.,"In conventional ΜΙC tests, fungi are exposed to constant drug concentrations, whereas in vivo, fungi are exposed to changing drug concentrations. Therefore, we developed a new in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model where human plasma pharmacokinetics of standard doses of 1 mg/kg amphotericin B, 4 mg/kg voriconazole, and 1 mg/kg caspofungin were simulated and their pharmacodynamic characteristics were determined against three clinical isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus terreus with identical MICs (1 mg/liter for amphotericin B, 0.5 mg/liter for voriconazole) and minimum effective concentrations (0.5 mg/liter for caspofungin). This new model consists of an internal compartment (a 10-ml dialysis tube made out of a semipermeable cellulose membrane allowing the free diffusion of antifungals but not galactomannan) inoculated with Aspergillus conidia and placed inside an external compartment (a 700-ml glass beaker) whose content is diluted after the addition of antifungal drugs by a peristaltic pump at the same rate as the clearance of the antifungal drugs in human plasma. Fungal growth was assessed by galactomannan production. Despite demonstrating the same MICs, amphotericin B completely inhibited (100%) A. fumigatus but not A. flavus and A. terreus, whose growth was delayed for 7.53 and 22.8 h, respectively. Voriconazole partially inhibited A. fumigatus (49.5%) and Α. flavus (27.9%) but not Α. terreus it delayed their growth by 3.99 h (A. fumigatus) and 5.37 h (Α. terreus). Caspofungin did not alter galactomannan production in all of the species but A. terreus. The new model simulated human pharmacokinetics of antifungal drugs and revealed important pharmacodynamic differences in their activity.",2012,22064546,no
[Pulmonary aspergillosis and HIV infection: about two cases].,"The occurrence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is unusual during the course of AIDS. Patients at risk have a CD4 T-lymphocyte count under 50 cells/mm(3) combined with other risk factors in 50% of the cases. Positive diagnosis is based on chest CT scan imaging and isolation of Aspergillus in broncho-alveolar fluid. Detection of galactomannan antigen in serum and broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) is a reliable complementary tool in assessing the diagnosis. The first line therapy is Voriconazole.

Antifungal treatment affects the laboratory diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the performance of non-invasive diagnostic tests such as galactomannan enzyme immunoassay and quantitative PCR in the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA), and how these tests are impacted upon by the use of different classes of antifungal agents in an in-vivo model of IA.A standardised rat inhalation model of IA was used to examine the effects of an azole, posaconazole, a polyene, amphotericin B and an echinocandin caspofungin. Daily blood samples were collected for subsequent analysis using a commercially available galactomannan assay and an inhouse qPCR assay.No significant differences were observed in the CE/g of Aspergillus fumigatus in the lungs of each group. qPCR was statistically more sensitive than galactomannan for both the early detection of infected controls (p=0.045) and for overall detection (p=0.018). However, antifungal treatment significantly reduced the overall sensitivity of qPCR (p=0.020) these effects were due to posaconazole and caspofungin. In the latter stages of infection (days 4 and 5) there were no significant differences in the numbers of infections detected by galactomannan and qPCRPrevious exposure to antifungal therapy must be considered when interpreting either qPCR or galactomannan-based IA diagnostics as this study has shown that individual classes of antifungal agents impact upon the dynamics of antigen and DNA release into the circulation.",2012,22049217,no
Treatment of refractory coccidioidomycosis with voriconazole or posaconazole.,"Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection of the desert southwestern United States. It may be self-limited or may require antifungal therapy. Currently used triazoles (eg, fluconazole and itraconazole) have largely supplanted amphotericin B, which is fraught with adverse effects. Limited case reports and small open-label trials show that voriconazole and posaconazole benefit patients with coccidioidomycosis refractory to first-line agents.We conducted a retrospective review of patients prescribed voriconazole or posaconazole for coccidioidomycosis at our institution between 1 January 2006 and 1 August 2010. Outcomes were assessed with both a retrospectively applied Mycosis Study Group score (ie, a composite score for symptoms, serology, and radiographic findings) and the documented impressions of treating medical practitioners.Twenty-one patients who received voriconazole and 16 who received posaconazole met study criteria. After a median duration of 6 months of voriconazole treatment, 14 of 21 patients (67%) were improved in overall status, 5 were unchanged, and 2 were unresponsive to voriconazole. After a median of 17 months of posaconazole treatment, 12 of 16 patients (75%) showed improvement, 1 was unchanged, and 3 were unresponsive due to medication intolerance or relapsed infection.Voriconazole and posaconazole are reasonable but not infallible options for salvage treatment of refractory coccidioidomycosis. Prospective comparative trials are required to provide further insights into their efficacy and utility.",2012,22045955,no
Galactomannan detection in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in patients with hematological diseases-the role of factors affecting assay performance.,"We evaluated the performance of a galactomannan (GM) assay in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid compared to serum samples for the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in patients with hematological diseases.Two hundred and fifty-five bronchoscopies were performed on 230 patients. Bronchial and alveolar samples from BAL fluid as well as serum samples were analyzed in the GM assay.Twenty-eight cases of IPA (11%) were diagnosed. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the GM assay using a cut-off of 0.5 were 57.1%, 99.3%, 94.1%, and 92.5%, respectively, for the alveolar sample 44.0%, 99.3%, 91.7%, and 91.4%, respectively, for the bronchial sampleIn contrast to recently published data, we found only moderate sensitivity, but high specificity and high positive predictive value of the detection of GM in BAL fluid. In addition, neutropenia, antifungal therapy, and BAL standardization affected GM assay performance.",2013,22040924,no
"Does ampicillin-sulbactam cause false positivity of (1,3)-beta-D-glucan assay? A prospective evaluation of 15 patients without invasive fungal infections.","The purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction between intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam treatment and (1,3)-beta-D-glucan (BDG) assay. Fifteen patients with a median age of 60 (16-81) without known risk factors for invasive fungal infections who received a daily dose of 3×2g ampicillin-sulbactam monotherapy from different batches were included in the study. Thirteen patients had soft tissue infections. The 5 of 13 patients who went under surgery had surgical dressings. Serum samples were obtained both before and after antibiotic infusion on the first, third, seventh and tenth days of an ampicillin-sulbactam treatment course. BDG was assayed using the Fungitell kit (Associates of Cape Cod, East Falmouth, MA, USA) according to manufacturers' specifications. All serum samples were also tested for galactomannan (GM) antigenemia by Platelia Aspergillus ELISA (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Marnes-la-Coquette, France). A total of 37 of 117 serum samples were positive for BDG at a threshold of 80pg ml(-1) . Seven of 37 BDG positive serum samples had a GM index ≥0.5. When a cutoff value of ≥0.5 was used for GM positivity, 16 (13.3%) serum samples were positive. For a cutoff value of ≥0.7, eight (6.6%) serum samples were positive. There were no statistically significant differences in the median BDG levels (P=0.47) or median GM indices (P =0.28) of the various sampling times. None of the SAM vials tested positive for BDG or GM. After ruling out fungal infections and all known potential causes of false BDG positivity, environmental contamination remained possible cause of BDG reactivity. We did not observe any significant association of ampicillin-sulbactam administration and positive assays for BDG or GM.",2012,22040530,no
Twenty-nine cases of invasive aspergillosis in neutropenic patients.,"Invasive aspergillosis is a life-threatening infectious complication in hematological patients undergoing immunosuppressive chemotherapy.We report 29 cases of invasive aspergillosis diagnosed in the Sousse Farhat Hached hospital Hematology unit, Tunisia, between 2002 and 2010.The most frequent disease (65.5%) was acute myeloid leukemia. All patients were severely neutropenic (<500/mm(3), mean duration=27 days). Pulmonary invasive aspergillosis was suggested in 28 (96.5%) cases. The most frequent respiratory signs were cough (64.3%), chest pain (53.6%), and hemoptysis (50%). The chest X-ray showed suggestive lesions in 60.7% of cases. CT scans revealed nodules with cavitation in 65% of cases, a halo sign in 20% of cases, and nodules in 15% of cases. Galactomannan antigenemia was positive in 88%, mycological examination positive in 51.6%, and seroconversion was noted in 35.7% of the cases. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was classified, according to EORTC/MSG criteria, as probable in 26 cases, possible in one case, and proven in one case. Aspergillus flavus was the dominant species in pulmonary invasive aspergillosis accounting for 73.7% of isolates. Extrapulmonary involvement was suggested in 39.3% of cases, the most frequent were sinusitis and brain abscess. Primary cutaneous aspergillosis was observed in one case. The overall mortality rate was 64.2% the 12-week survival rate was 71.4%.Our results are correlated to published data. A. flavus was the most frequent species in our region.",2012,22036518,no
Microwave-mediated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay procedure.,"Here we demonstrate a novel microwave-mediated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MELISA) method that has dramatically reduced the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) timing to less than 5 min with a result comparable to that obtained by 18-h conventional ELISA. Efficacy of the MELISA procedure is demonstrated by detecting human immunoglobulin G (IgG), rabbit IgG, human immunoglobulin E (IgE), human interleuken 1β (IL-1β), Entamoeba histolytica antibody, and Aspergillus fumigatus antibody. MELISA could be an excellent substitute for time-consuming conventional ELISA for rapid diagnosis of diseases in cases of medical urgency, outbreak of infectious diseases, and screening of samples in blood banks or emigration counters.",2012,22033289,no
Diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis by a commercial real-time PCR assay for Aspergillus DNA in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from high-risk patients compared to a galactomannan enzyme immunoassay.,"Culture-independent molecular techniques such as real-time PCRs offer the potential for early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA), thereby reducing the disease-associated mortality rate. PCR-based testing is presently excluded from disease-defining consensus criteria due to lack of standardization and clinical validation. A single-center prospective study was conducted to investigate the performance of the commercially available MycAssay Aspergillus test for detecting Aspergillus DNA in patients with suspicion of IA. To this end, a total of 158 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid specimens that were consecutively collected from hematology (n = 68) and intensive care unit (n = 90) patients were examined. Sixteen of 17 (94.1%) specimens from patients with proven/probable IA were MycAssay positive, and 15 of these 16 patients were also positive by an ""in-house"" PCR assay. A total of 139 of 141 (98.6%) specimens from patients without proven/probable IA were MycAssay negative. Fifteen of 16 (94.1%) MycAssay-positive patients were also positive for BAL fluid galactomannan (GM) at an index cutoff of ≥1.0 (index range, 1.1 to 8.3), as were 3 patients without IA but with pulmonary fusariosis. Interestingly, in seven of the PCR-positive BAL specimens that tested culture positive for Aspergillus species, cycle threshold values were earlier than those of specimens with a culture-negative result. In conclusion, the MycAssay Aspergillus PCR appears to be a sensitive and specific molecular test for the diagnosis of IA, and its performance is comparable to that of the GM assay. However, more large studies are necessary to firmly establish its clinical utility in high-risk settings.",2012,22012015,no
Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in non-neutropenic patients: analysis of a 14-month prospective clinical experience.,"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in severely immunocompromised patients, but recently several authors have reported the occurrence of IPA in liver cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, most of whom, but not all, were receiving steroid treatment, with a very high mortality rate. The detection of galactomannan performed in respiratory specimens is a new valuable test for the diagnosis of probable IPA, even in non-neutropenic high risk patients. Since the frequency and clinical impact of IPA in non-hematologic patients is not well known, it seemed rational to us to attempt a prospective study evaluating all patients hospitalized in a university hospital for whom an infectious Diseases consultation was required. This 14-month survey in our hospital, using recently recommended diagnostic criteria, seems to suggest an emerging role of IPA in these patients who may have a higher mortality rate than their neutropenic peers, and provides preliminary evidence that early diagnosis and prompt initiation of antifungal therapy may improve the ultimate outcome of their IPA.",2012,22005062,no
Molecular detection and species-specific identification of medically important Aspergillus species by real-time PCR in experimental invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.,"Diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) remains a major challenge to clinical microbiology laboratories. We developed rapid and sensitive quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays for genus- and species-specific identification of Aspergillus infections by use of TaqMan technology. In order to validate these assays and understand their potential diagnostic utility, we then performed a blinded study of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid specimens from well-characterized models of IPA with the four medically important species. A set of real-time qPCR primers and probes was developed by utilizing unique ITS1 regions for genus- and species-specific detection of the four most common medically important Aspergillus species (Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. niger, and A. terreus). Pan-Aspergillus and species-specific qPCRs with BAL fluid were more sensitive than culture for detection of IPA caused by A. fumigatus in untreated (P < 0.0007) and treated (P ≤ 0.008) animals, respectively. For infections caused by A. terreus and A. niger, culture and PCR amplification from BAL fluid yielded similar sensitivities for untreated and treated animals. Pan-Aspergillus PCR was more sensitive than culture for detection of A. flavus in treated animals (P = 0.002). BAL fluid pan-Aspergillus and species-specific PCRs were comparable in sensitivity to BAL fluid galactomannan (GM) assay. The copy numbers from the qPCR assays correlated with quantitative cultures to determine the pulmonary residual fungal burdens in lung tissue. Pan-Aspergillus and species-specific qPCR assays may improve the rapid and accurate identification of IPA in immunocompromised patients.",2012,21976757,no
Detection of antibody against fungal glucosylceramide in immunocompromised patients: a potential new diagnostic approach for cryptococcosis.,"We have developed an ELISA to determine the value of anti-glucosylceramide antibody for the prediction of disseminated cryptococcosis in immunocompromised subjects and performed a clinical prospective study at the Medical University of South Carolina. The study enrolled a total of 53 patients who were free of active fungal diseases at the time of enrollment but at risk of developing one because they were all immunocompromised, e.g., (1) patients positive for HIV and (2) patients post- or awaiting solid organ transplantation. Among 53 patients enrolled, two patients developed invasive cryptococcosis, and in both patients, IgM anti-GlcCer was detected in sera using the ELISA at least 6 weeks prior to the clinical presentation of the brain disease. These results were corroborated by a cryptococcal antigen lateral flow assay, which was also positive in serum prior to the development of meningoencephalitis. However, a high number of positive results were also detected in patients with no evidence of cryptococcosis. This study highlights the potential utility of this new assay in early diagnostic testing algorithms for patients at risk for cryptococcosis, but further investigations are needed to validate the sensitivity and specificity of the glucosylceramide ELISA as a predictor of cryptococcosis.",2012,21971701,no
Diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy of lung infiltrates in febrile neutropenic cancer patients.,"Pulmonary infiltrates develop in up to 25% of febrile neutropenic patients and are frequently refractory to broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy. Etiologically, Aspergillus spp., Pneumocystis jiroveci, multi-resistant Gram-negative rods as well as mycobacteria and respiratory viruses may be involved. Taking into account the predominant role of fungal pathogens, typically without microbiological proof, prompt addition of mold-active systemic antifungal therapy improves clinical outcome, while other microorganisms should typically be targeted based upon microbiological test results only. Microbial isolates from blood cultures, bronchoalveolar lavage or respiratory secretions must be critically interpreted with respect to their etiological relevance for pulmonary infiltrates. Non-culture based diagnostic procedures to detect circulating antigens such as galactomannan or 1,3-beta-D-glucan, or PCR techniques to amplify DNA from blood, bronchoalveolar lavage or tissue specimens, may facilitate the diagnosis. For pre-emptive antifungal treatment, voriconazole or liposomal amphotericin B are preferred. Antifungal treatment should be continued for at least 14 days before non-response and treatment modification are considered. Primary choice for treatment of Pneumocystis pneumonia remains high-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, while cytomegalovirus pneumonia is treated with ganciclovir in the majority of patients affected.",2011,21956704,no
Assessing responses to treatment of opportunistic mycoses and salvage strategies.,"Invasive fungal disease (IFD) in immunocompromised patients remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality and there is a pressing need for studies of novel antifungal agents and strategies to improve outcomes. Trial design details often determine not only the appropriate interpretation of the results, but also their translation into clinical practice. However, the conduct of IFD clinical trials remains challenging due to the rarity of IFD, heterogeneity of underlying diseases, and the lack of clear and standardized response criteria. Response assessments are influenced by host, underlying disease and treatment factors as well as eligibility criteria. In addition, the criteria used to assess response, when response is assessed and the type of antifungal therapy under study can impact response evaluations. This article will discuss recent trials of primary, salvage, empiric, and prophylactic antifungal therapy with specific attention to the design of these antifungal therapy trials and how their designs influence their interpretation. The potential role of surrogate markers, such as the galactomannan index, fungal deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase chain reaction assay, and (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scans in establishing the early diagnosis of IFD, as well as enhancing the ability to assess outcomes to antifungal therapy, and thereby the optimal duration of antifungal therapy, will be discussed.",2011,21948189,no
Biopsy procedures for molecular tissue diagnosis of invasive fungal infections.,"The incidence of invasive fungal infections (IFI) has increased substantially and the epidemiology has changed dramatically in recent years. Candida albicans is still most important, but non-albicans species, Aspergillus species, Glomeromycota (formerly Zygomycetes) and Fusarium species are an increasing cause of IFIs. Due to this growing diversity, the identification of the causative organism to genus and species level is important to perform best and adequate treatment. The early, sensitive and specific detection of IFIs remains challenging and current conventional methods are limited. The golden standard for the definite diagnosis of proven pulmonary infection remains either histopathologic, cytopathologic or direct tissue examination. Invasive procedures are necessary to obtain reliable specimens and biopsies may be taken percutaneously, bronchoscopically, via open surgery or via video-assisted thorascopic surgery. Molecular methods, like PCR or in situ hybridization, are a promising diagnostic tool for rapid and reliable species identification and should be performed in addition to microscopic examination and culture to increase the sensitivity for the diagnosis of IFI. Combining culture, microscopy, serology, and PCR in lung tissues and/or bronchial samples will increase the diagnostic yield by 99%. Here, we give an overview of biopsy procedures for molecular tissue diagnosis of IFI.",2011,21948145,no
Invasive fungal sinusitis in patients with hematological malignancy: 15 years experience in a single university hospital in Taiwan.,"Risk factors and outcomes in hematological patients who acquire invasive fungal sinusitis (IFS) are infrequently reported in the modern medical era.A retrospective study of hospitalized patients with hematological disease was conducted at National Taiwan University Hospital between January 1995 and December 2009.Clinical characteristics and outcomes with their associated radiographic and microbiological findings were analyzed. Forty-six patients with IFS and 64 patients with chronic non-invasive sinusitis were enrolled as comparsion. IFS developed more commonly in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and with prolonged neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count less than 500/mm³ for more than 10 days) (p < 0.001). Aspergillus flavus was the most common pathogen isolated (44%). Serum Aspergillus galactomannan antigen was elevated in seven of eleven patients (64%) with IFS caused by aspergillosis but negative for all three patients with mucormycosis. Bony erosion and extra-sinus infiltration was found in 15 of 46 (33%) patients on imaging. Overall, 19 of 46 patients (41.3%) died within 6 weeks. Patients with disease subtype of AML (p = 0.044 Odds Ratio [OR], 5.84Patients of AML with prolonged neutropenia (> 10 days) had significantly higher risk of IFS.

Secondary Antifungal Prophylaxis in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)/Acute Leukemia Patients.,"In this review, the role of secondary antifungal prophylaxis (SAP) in prevention of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) in patients with leukemia and in those receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is discussed. A history of IFI is not an absolute contraindication for allo-HSCT or continuation of cytotoxic chemotherapy, provided that SAP is administered. We suggest that the last antifungal drug successfully used for treatment of the previous IFI is also used for SAP during SAP, we propose an algorithm of thorough clinical, radiological and microbiological monitoring with monthly CT scan and twice weekly galactomannan assays. However, the optimal preventive strategy for patients with a prior IFI has not been defined and concerted efforts are warranted to optimize the management of affected patients.",2011,21931981,no
ECIL recommendations for the use of biological markers for the diagnosis of invasive fungal diseases in leukemic patients and hematopoietic SCT recipients.,"As culture-based methods for the diagnosis of invasive fungal diseases (IFD) in leukemia and hematopoietic SCT patients have limited performance, non-culture methods are increasingly being used. The third European Conference on Infections in Leukemia (ECIL-3) meeting aimed at establishing evidence-based recommendations for the use of biological tests in adult patients, based on the grading system of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

"Pulmonary venous invasion, determined by chest computed tomographic scan, as a potential early indicator of zygomycosis infection: a case series.","Zygomycosis is a life-threatening fungal infection, and its successful treatment requires early diagnosis. To establish radiologic and clinical criteria for early diagnosis, we reviewed 3 post-mortem cases with zygomycosis secondary to hematological diseases. In all cases, an irregular dilatation of pulmonary veins on computed tomography suggested venous invasion by fungal hyphae, which was confirmed at autopsy. In addition, serum samples tested negative for the Aspergillus galactomannan antigen in all cases.

Impact of galactomannan testing on the prevalence of invasive aspergillosis in patients with hematological malignancies.,"Galactomannan (GM) is a polysaccharide component of the cell wall of Aspergillus spp. and is released into the host's circulation by growing hyphae. GM testing of patients with hematological malignancies has been rarely considered in recent epidemiologic studies of invasive mould infections (IMIs). The aim of the investigation was to analyze the impact of GM testing on the reported prevalence of IMI by comparing detection rates of IMI before and after the introduction of this diagnostic procedure. Prevalence of IMI was assessed by conducting a prospective single-centre study over seven months in 2010. Results obtained were then compared to those obtained with a representative collection of patients assessed by the same investigators at the same institution over seven months in 2007, i.e., prior to the introduction of GM testing. We found that, in general, detection rates of invasive aspergillosis (IA) and invasive mould infections increased significantly after the introduction of GM analysis. This study may therefore indicate that GM testing has a significant impact on the reported prevalence of IMI. Broad usage of such testing in patients with hematological malignancies may be able to produce a realistic picture of IMI rates when current diagnostic criteria are applied.",2012,21905944,no
Characterization of new Alternaria alternata--specific rat monoclonal antibodies.,"In this study, three different rat hybridoma cell lines secreting monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing the spores from Alternaria alternata, a plant pathogenic fungus, contaminant of food products and important cause of both allergic rhinitis and asthma, have been characterized. These three mAbs are all of IgM isotype. Two antibodies, A1 and F10, were cross-reactive antibodies recognizing spores from Alternaria, Cladosporium, Penicillium, Aspergillus and Stachybotrys genera, but not the yeasts Saccharomyces                         cerevisiae or Candida albicans. Competitive and sandwich assays demonstrated that these two mAbs were directed against the same or very close repetitive(s) epitope(s). A1-based sandwich ELISA efficiently detected this epitope in various mould (but not yeast)-soluble extracts prepared from strains grown in the laboratory. Moreover, this A1-based sandwich ELISA detected its cognate epitope in air and dust samples obtained from dwellings. The third antibody, E5, recognized only the spores of Alternaria and the phylogenetically very close Ulocladium botrytis. This E5 antibody is directed against a repetitive epitope found in Alternaria and Ulocladium laboratory extracts and can be used in a sandwich assay for the quantification of these moulds. Therefore, E5 antibody is a promising tool for the development of Alternaria-Ulocladium-specific immunoassays, while A1 and F10 could be interesting tools for the quantification of the total mould biomass.",2012,21892786,no
"Alpha2-macroglobulin from an Atlantic shrimp: biochemical characterization, sub-cellular localization and gene expression upon fungal challenge.","In this study, we report on the isolation and characterization of an alpha2-macroglobulin (α2M) from the plasma of the pink shrimp Farfantepenaeus paulensis, its sub-cellular localization and transcriptional changes after infection by fungi. The molecular mass of the α2M was estimated at 389 kDa by gel filtration and 197 kDa by SDS-PAGE, under reducing conditions, suggesting that α2M from F. paulensis consists of two identical sub-units, covalently linked by disulphide bonds. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the α2M from F. paulensis was very similar to those of other penaeid shrimps, crayfish and lobster (70-90% identity) and to a less extent with that of freshwater prawn (40% identity). A monoclonal antibody raised against the Marsupenaeus japonicus α2M made it possible to demonstrate that α2M of F. paulensis is stored in the vesicles of the shrimp granular hemocytes (through immunogold assay). Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis showed that α2M mRNA transcripts significantly increased 24 h after an experimental infection with the shrimp pathogen Fusarium solani and it returned to the basal levels at 48 h post-injection. This is the first report on a α2M characterization in an Atlantic penaeid species and its expression profile upon a fungal infection.",2012,21888978,no
Nuclear transporters in a multinucleated organism: functional and localization analyses in Aspergillus nidulans.,"Nuclear transporters mediate bidirectional macromolecule traffic through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), thus participating in vital processes of eukaryotic cells. A systematic functional analysis in Aspergillus nidulans permitted the identification of 4 essential nuclear transport pathways of a hypothetical number of 14. The absence of phenotypes for most deletants indicates redundant roles for these nuclear receptors. Subcellular distribution studies of these carriers show three main distributions: nuclear, nucleocytoplasmic, and in association with the nuclear envelope. These locations are not specific to predicted roles as exportins or importins but indicate that bidirectional transport may occur coordinately in all nuclei of a syncytium. Coinciding with mitotic NPC rearrangements, transporters dynamically modified their localizations, suggesting supplementary roles to nucleocytoplasmic transport specifically during mitosis. Loss of transportin-SR and Mex/TAP from the nuclear envelope indicates absence of RNA transport during the partially open mitosis of Aspergillus, whereas nucleolar accumulation of Kap121 and Kap123 homologues suggests a role in nucleolar disassembly. This work provides new insight into the roles of nuclear transporters and opens an avenue for future studies of the molecular mechanisms of transport among nuclei within a common cytoplasm, using A. nidulans as a model organism.",2012,21880896,no
Bimutation breeding of Aspergillus niger strain for enhancing β-mannanase production by solid-state fermentation.,"A parent strain Aspergillus niger LW-1 was mutated by the compound mutagenesis of vacuum microwave (VMW) and ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS). A mutant strain, designated as A. niger E-30, with high- and stable-yield β-mannanase was obtained through a series of screening. The β-mannanase activity of the mutant strain E-30, cultivated on the basic fermentation medium at 32°C for 96 h, reached 36,675 U/g dried koji, being 1.98-fold higher than that (18,50 1U/g dried koji) of the parent strain LW-1. The purified E-30 β-mannanase, a glycoprotein with a carbohydrate content of 19.6%, had an apparent molecular weight of about 42.0 kDa by SDS-PAGE. Its optimal pH and temperature were 3.5 and 65°C, respectively. It was highly stable at a pH range of 3.5-7.0 and at a temperature of 60°C and below. The kinetic parameters K(m) and V(max), toward locust bean gum and at pH 4.8 and 50°C, were 3.68 mg/mL and 1067.5 U/mg, respectively. The β-mannanase activity was not significantly affected by an array of metal ions and EDTA, but strongly inhibited by Ag(+) and Hg(2+). In addition, the hydrolytic conditions of konjak glucomannan using the purified E-30 β-mannanase were optimized as follows: konjak gum solution 240 g/L (dissolved in deionized water), hydrolytic temperature 50°C, β-mannanase dosage 120 U/g konjak gum, and hydrolytic time 8 h.",2012,21867993,no
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis: Lessons for the busy radiologist.,"The probability of a radiologist interpreting a disease correctly is not only influenced by their training and experience but also on the knowledge of a particular entity. This editorial reviews certain myths and realities associated with radiological manifestations of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). ABPA is a hypersensitivity disorder against the antigens of Aspergillus fumigatus. Although commonly manifesting with central bronchiectasis (CB), the disorder can present without any abnormalities on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest, so-called serologic ABPA (ABPA-S). HRCT of the chest should not be used in screening or in the initial diagnostic work up of asthmatics, as asthma without ABPA can manifest with findings of CB. High-attenuation mucus (HAM) is the pathognomonic sign of ABPA and is very helpful in the diagnosis of ABPA complicating asthma and cystic fibrosis. Instead of classifying ABPA based on the presence and absence of CB into ABPA-CB and ABPA-S respectively, ABPA should be classified as ABPA-S, ABPA-CB and ABPA-CB-HAM. The classification scheme based on HAM not only identifies an immunologically severe disease but also predicts a patient with increased risk of recurrent relapses.",2011,21860713,no
"Computed tomography findings in invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in non-neutropenic transplant recipients and neutropenic patients, and their prognostic value.","We evaluated CT findings and their prognostic value in non-neutropenic transplant recipients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) compared with neutropenic patients with IPA.All adult patients during a 27-month who met the criteria for proven or probable IPA according to the 2008 EORTC/MSG criteria were retrospectively enrolled. Initial CT findings were reviewed by two radiologists blinded to the patients' demographics and clinical outcomes.A total of 50 non-neutropenic transplant recipients and 60 neutropenic patients were enrolled. Consolidation-or-mass, halo signs, and angio-invasive form were observed less often in non-neutropenic transplant recipients than in neutropenic patients: (56%, 26%, and 32%) versus (78%, 55%, and 60%, p = 0.01, p = 0.002, and p = 0.003, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that macronodules (HR 0.31, p = 0.001), multiple infarct-shaped consolidations (HR 4.26, p < 0.001), renal replacement therapy (HR 5.62, p < 0.001) and persistence of a positive serum galactomannan (HR 7.14, p < 0.001) were independently associated with 90-day mortality.Our data indicate that CT findings in non-neutropenic transplant recipients with IPA are similar to those in neutropenic patients with IPA except that consolidation-or-mass, halo sings, and angio-invasive form are less frequent, and certain CT findings such as macronodules and multiple infarct-shaped consolidations have prognostic implications in IPA.",2012,21854805,no
Earlier response assessment in invasive aspergillosis based on the kinetics of serum Aspergillus galactomannan: proposal for a new definition.,"Current criteria for assessing treatment response of invasive aspergillosis (IA) rely on nonspecific subjective parameters. We hypothesized that an Aspergillus-specific response definition based on the kinetics of serum Aspergillus galactomannan index (GMI) would provide earlier and more objective response assessment.We compared the 6-week European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) response criteria with GMI-based response among 115 cancer patients with IA. Success according to GMI required survival with repeatedly negative GMI for ≥2 weeks. Time to response and agreement between the 2 definitions were the study endpoints.Success according to EORTC/MSG and GMI criteria was observed in 73 patients (63%) and 83 patients (72%), respectively. The GMI-based response was determined at a median of 21 days after treatment initiation (range, 15-41 days), 3 weeks before the EORTC/MSG time point, in 72 (87%) of 83 responders. Agreement between definitions was shown in all 32 nonresponders and in 73 of the 83 responders (91% overall), with an excellent κ correlation coefficient of 0.819. Among 10 patients with discordant response (EORTC/MSG failure, GMI success), 1 is alive without IA 3 years after diagnosis for the other, aspergillosis could not be detected at autopsy. The presence of other life-threatening complications in the remaining 8 patients indicates that IA had resolved.The Aspergillus-specific GMI-based criteria compare favorably to current response definitions for IA and significantly shorten time to response assessment. These criteria rely on a simple, reproducible, objective, and Aspergillus-specific test and should serve as the primary endpoint in trials of IA.",2011,21846834,no
Assessment of exposure of Egyptian infants to aflatoxin M1 through breast milk.,"Mothers are exposed to many toxins that can reach their infants through breast milk. One of these toxins is aflatoxins, produced by Aspergillus fungus. Aspergillus colonizes grains, especially in tropical regions where there is high temperature and humidity. Aflatoxins are highly toxic, mutagenic, teratogenic, and carcinogenic. One of these is aflatoxin B1 that is excreted in breast milk as aflatoxin M1 (AFM1).This is a cross-sectional study in which 150 mother-infant dyads were included. All the infants were exclusively breastfed. Infant weights' standard deviation scores were documented at birth and at 6 months. At 6 months, before starting weaning, AFM1 was measured in breast milk by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and by liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) for all mothers and infants.Ninety-eight mothers (65.3%) had AFM1-positive breast milk samples (AFM1>0.05 μg/l according to the European Community and Codex Alimentarius). AFM1 levels ranged between 0.2 and 19.0 μg/l (mean: 7.1±5.0 μg/l). In cases considered negative, AFM1 levels ranged between 0.01and 0.05 μg/l (mean: 0.04±0.01 μg/l). Infants of AFM1-positive mothers had lower weight standard deviation scores at birth and at 6 months (P=0.04 and 0.0001). ALT and aspartate aminotransferase of mothers and ALT of infants were significantly higher in dyads having AFM1-positive breast milk (P=0.0001, 0.0001, and 0.03, respectively).Aflatoxins represent a real threat in Egypt. The higher liver enzymes in AFM1-positive cases might represent an alarm toward future development of hepatocellular carcinoma.Cooperation of ministries is recommended to combat this problem. The public should be educated about proper food storage and about the hazards of aflatoxin ingestion.",2016,21844759,no
Sequential air-liquid exposure of human respiratory cells to chemical and biological pollutants.,"Although indoor air has wide ranging effects on human health, the effects of environmental, chemical, and biological pollutants on the respiratory system are not fully understood. In order to clarify the health effects of airborne pollutant exposure, it would appear that toxicological evidence is needed to complement epidemiological observations to support by providing biological plausibility. The aim of this study is to manage air-liquid successive exposures to different pollutants such as a chemical pollutant (formaldehyde--FA), and a biological contaminant (Aspergillus fumigatus--Asp) using our in vitro model. Human alveolar cells (A549) were exposed at the air-liquid interface in an exposure module, firstly to an environmental level of FA (50 μg/m³) (or air) for 30 min, and 14 h later to Asp (7×10⁸ spores/m³) (or air) for 30 min. After 10 h post-incubation, cellular viability was assessed. Inflammation biomarkers (IL-8, MCP-1) were assayed by ELISA and by RT-PCR. Whatever the conditions, no cytotoxic effect was observed. FA followed by air exposure did not induce modification of production and expression of cytokines, confirming results with a unique FA exposure. Air followed by Asp exposure tended to induce IL-8 expression whereas IL-8 production tended to increase after FA and Asp exposure compared to FA and air exposure. The reaction of cells to sequential exposure to FA and Asp was moderate. These results show the feasibility of our model for sequential exposures to different types of environmental pollutants, allowing using it for preliminary assessment of cellular activity modification induced by airborne contaminants.",2012,21840384,no
Anti-inflammatory effect of fluvastatin on IL-8 production induced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aspergillus fumigatus antigens in cystic fibrosis.,"Early in life, patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are infected with microorganisms including bacteria and fungi, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aspergillus fumigatus. Since recent research has identified the anti-inflammatory properties of statins (besides their lipid-lowering effects), we investigated the effect of fluvastatin on the production of the potent neutrophil chemoattractant chemokine, IL-8, in whole blood from CF patients, stimulated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (LPS) and Aspergillus fumigatus (AFA) antigens.Whole blood from adult patients with CF and from healthy volunteers was collected at the Rennes University Hospital (France). Blood was pretreated for 1 h with fluvastatin (0-300 µM) and incubated for 24 h with LPS (10 µg/mL) and/or AFA (diluted 1/200). IL-8 protein levels, quantified by ELISA, were increased in a concentration-dependent manner when cells were stimulated by LPS or AFA. Fluvastatin strongly decreased the levels of IL-8, in a concentration-dependent manner, in whole blood from CF patients. However, its inhibitory effect was decreased or absent in whole blood from healthy subjects. Furthermore, the inhibition induced by fluvastatin in CF whole blood was reversed in the presence of intermediates within the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, mevalonate, farnesyl pyprophosphate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate that activate small GTPases by isoprenylation.For the first time, the inhibitory effects of fluvastatin on CF systemic inflammation may reveal the important therapeutic potential of statins in pathological conditions associated with the over-production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines as observed during the manifestation of CF. The anti-inflammatory effect could be related to the modulation of the prenylation of signalling proteins.",2011,21826199,no
Efficacy of anidulafungin against Aspergillus niger in vitro and in vivo.,"In this study, anidulafungin (AFG) showed high in vitro activity against 10 isolates of Aspergillus niger by broth microdilution and disk diffusion methods. The efficacy of AFG at 1, 5 and 10 mg/kg was tested against six of the isolates in a murine model of disseminated infection. AFG was able to reduce mortality, showing survival rates of 70-100%, 60-100% and 30-60% in mice treated with AFG at 10, 5 and 1 mg/kg, respectively. AFG also showed a dose-response efficacy in reducing tissue burden in kidneys and spleen. A parallel experiment demonstrated that administration of AFG did not reduce serum concentrations of galactomannan in mice. Histopathological studies confirmed the efficacy of AFG.",2012,21824751,no
Serum procalcitonin levels in patients with myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies-associated glomerulonephritis.,"High serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels (≥0.5 ng/mL) commonly occur with systemic bacterial and fungal infections. Although several studies suggested that measuring serum PCT levels may serve as a useful marker to distinguish between active antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated diseases and invasive infections, there is no information on PCT in myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis.The authors measured serum PCT concentrations before initiation of immunosuppressive therapy in 67 patients with biopsy-proven MPO-ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis. The authors compared complications and clinicopathological parameters between patients with serum PCT levels of <0.5 ng/mL (group A: 58 patients) and ≥0.5 ng/mL (group B: 9 patients).All 58 patients in group A did not show any clinical sign of systemic infection. On the other hand, 3 of 9 patients in group B had bacterial or fungal infections of the respiratory or urinary tact. One patient had a history of chronic urinary tract infection. In the remaining 5 patients in group B, there were 3 patients with concurrent malignancies and 1 postoperative patient with malignancy. Another in group B had a long history of interstitial pneumonia of unknown origin and severe renal insufficiency. Serum levels of C-reactive protein and creatinine were significantly higher in group B than in group A.In patients with MPO-ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis, serum PCT levels of ≥0.5 ng/mL are recommended as cutoff for consideration of bacterial and fungal infections. Elevated serum PCT levels could also be observed in some patients with severe injury of the kidneys and/or lungs in the absence of infection.",2012,21817883,no
"Prospective study in critically ill non-neutropenic patients: diagnostic potential of (1,3)-β-D-glucan assay and circulating galactomannan for the diagnosis of invasive fungal disease.","Diagnosis of invasive fungal disease (IFD) in patients under intensive care is challenging. Circulating biomarkers, (1,3)-β-D-glucan (BG) and galactomannan (GM), were prospectively assessed in 98 critically ill patients at risk of IFD. There were 11 cases of invasive aspergillosis (IA 4 proven and 7 probable), 9 cases of proven invasive candidiasis (IC), 1 case of mixed proven IC and probable IA, 1 case of proven zygomycosis, and 1 case of mixed mycelial proven IFD. In all IA cases there was no significant difference when the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of GM (0.873 [95%CI, 0.75-0.99]) and BG (0.856 [95% CI, 0.71-0.99]) were compared (p = 0.871). The AUC for BG in IC and for the rest of the IFD cases was 0.605 (95% CI, 0.39-0.82) and 0.768 (95% CI, 0.63-0.90) respectively. Positive BG (40%) predated blood culture (n = 3) and abdominal pus (n = 1) a mean of 3.25 days before Candida was grown. In patients with IFD caused by molds, BG appeared a mean of 5.65 days before culture results. For the diagnosis of patients at risk of IC, BG has shown a high NPV (94.5%), with positive results also predating blood cultures in 30% of patients. In conclusion, early BG results permit a timely initiation of antifungal therapy in patients at risk of IFD.",2012,21811868,yes
Invasive fungal infections in acute leukemia.,"Invasive fungal infection (IFI) is among the leading causes for morbidity, mortality, and economic burden for patients with acute leukemia. In the past few decades, the incidence of IFI has increased dramatically. The certainty of diagnosis of IFI is based on host factors, clinical evidence, and microbiological examination. Advancement in molecular diagnostic modalities (e.g. non-culture-based serum biomarkers such as β-glucan or galactomannan assays) and high-resolution radiological imaging has improved our diagnostic approach. The early use of these diagnostic tests assists in the early initiation of preemptive therapy. Nonetheless, the complexity of IFI in patients with leukemia and the limitations of these diagnostic tools still mandate astute clinical acumen. Its management has been further complicated by the increasing frequency of infection by non-Aspergillus molds (e.g. zygomycosis) and the emergence of drug-resistant fungal pathogens. In addition, even though the antifungal armamentarium has expanded rapidly in the past few decades, the associated mortality remains high. The decision to initiate antifungal treatment and the choice of anti-fungal therapy requires careful consideration of several factors (e.g. risk stratification, local fungal epidemiologic patterns, concomitant comorbidities, drug-drug interactions, prior history of antifungal use, overall cost, and the pharmacologic profile of the antifungal agents). In order to optimize our diagnostic and therapeutic management of IFI in patients with acute leukemia, further basic research and clinical trials are desperately needed.",2011,23556092,no
Eumycetoma caused by Diaporthe phaseolorum (Phomopsis phaseoli): a case report and a mini-review of Diaporthe/Phomopsis spp invasive infections in humans.,"Diaporthe phaseolorum (syn. Phomopsis phaseoli) is a frequent fungal parasite of plants, present on all continents around the world. It has rarely been involved in human diseases. We report a case of eumycetoma with osteomyelitis of the forefoot caused by this fungus and diagnosed by molecular biology. The patient had positive HTLV-1 serology and was a farmer from French Guiana who walked barefoot. He was successfully treated with long-term oral itraconazole (400 mg/day).

Quantification of the Aspergillus versicolor allergen in house dust.,"Aspergillus versicolor, a fungus commonly found on damp building materials, produces the allergen, Asp v 13. Here we report a sensitive Asp v 13 capture ELISA for A. versicolor spores and spore- and mycelial fragments in house dust samples. The method is based on a double polyclonal capture ELSIA. The detection limits for Asp v 13 antigen and A. versicolor spores without dust were 2.44 pg and 12 ng (ca. 110 spores). Detection limits for Asp v 13 and A. versicolor spores in sieved house dust samples were 1.0 ng and 7.8 μg per gram dry weight house dust, respectively. This detection limit is lower than for other house dust allergen immunoassays including for Stachybotrys chartarum, Aspergillus fumigatus, but much lower than that from Alternaria alternata.",2011,21763696,no
Epidemiology and treatment approaches in management of invasive fungal infections.,"Over the past 20 years, the number of invasive fungal infections has continued to persist, due primarily to the increased numbers of patients subjected to severe immunosuppression. Despite the development of more active, less toxic antifungal agents and the standard use of antifungal prophylaxis, invasive fungal infections (especially invasive mold infections) continue to be a significant factor in hematopoietic cell and solid organ transplantation outcomes, resulting in high mortality rates. Since the use of fluconazole as standard prophylaxis in the hematopoietic cell transplantation setting, invasive candidiasis has come under control, but no mold-active antifungal agent (except for posaconazole in the setting of acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome) has been shown to improve the survival rate over fluconazole. With the advent of new azole and echinocandin agents, we have seen the emergence of more azole-resistant and echinocandin-resistant fungi. The recent increase in zygomycosis seen in the hematopoietic cell transplantation setting may be due to the increased use of voriconazole. This has implications for the empiric approach to pulmonary invasive mold infections when zygomycosis cannot be ruled out. It is imperative that an amphotericin B product, an antifungal that has never developed resistance in over 50 years, be initiated. The clinical presentations of invasive mold infections and invasive candidiasis can be nonspecific and the diagnostic tests insensitive, so a high index of suspicion and immediate initiation of empiric therapy is required. Unfortunately, our currently available serologic tests do not predict infection ahead of disease, and, therefore cannot be used to initiate ""preemptive"" therapy. Also, the Aspergillus galactomannan test gives a false negative result in patients receiving antimold prophylaxis, ie, virtually all of our patients with hematologic malignancy and hematopoietic cell transplant recipients. We may eventually be able to select patients at highest risk for invasive fungal infections for prophylaxis by genetic testing. However, with our current armamentarium of antifungal agents and widespread use of prophylaxis in high-risk groups (hematologic malignancy, hematopoietic cell transplantation), we continue to see high incidence and mortality rates, and our future hope lies in reversing the immunosuppression or augmenting the immune system of these severely immunocompromised hosts by developing and utilizing immunotherapy, immunoprophylaxis, and vaccines.",2011,21750627,no
Mycobiota and mycotoxins in bee pollen collected from different areas of Slovakia.,"Contamination by microscopic fungi and mycotoxins in different bee pollen samples, which were stored under three different ways of storing as freezing, drying and UV radiation, was investigated. During spring 2009, 45 samples of bee-collected pollen were gathered from beekeepers who placed their bee colonies on monocultures of sunflower, rape and poppy fields within their flying distance. Bee pollen was collected from bees' legs by special devices placed at the entrance to hives. Samples were examined for the concentration and identification of microscopic fungi able to grow on Malt and Czapek-Dox agar and mycotoxins content [deoxynivalenol (DON), T-2 toxin (T-2), zearalenone (ZON) and total aflatoxins (AFL), fumonisins (FUM), ochratoxins (OTA)] by direct competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The total number of microscopic fungi in this study ranged from 2.98 ± 0.02 in frozen sunflower bee pollen to 4.06 ± 0.10 log cfu.g(-1) in sunflower bee pollen after UV radiation. In this study, 449 isolates belonging to 21 fungal species representing 9 genera were found in 45 samples of bee pollen. The total isolates were detected in frozen poppy pollen 29, rape pollen 40, sunflower pollen 80, in dried poppy pollen 12, rape pollen 36, sunflower 78, in poppy pollen after UV radiation treatment 54, rape 59 and sunflower 58. The most frequent isolates of microscopic fungi found in bee pollen samples of all prevalent species were Mucor mucedo (49 isolates), Alternaria alternata (40 isolates), Mucor hiemalis (40 isolates), Aspergillus fumigatus (33 isolates) and Cladosporium cladosporioides (31 isolates). The most frequently found isolates were detected in sunflower bee pollen frozen (80 isolates) and the lowest number of isolates was observed in poppy bee pollen dried (12 isolates). The most prevalent mycotoxin of poppy bee pollen was ZON (361.55 ± 0.26 μg.kg(-1)), in rape bee pollen T-2 toxin (265.40 ± 0.18 μg.kg(-1)) and in sunflower bee pollen T-2 toxin (364.72 ± 0.13 μg.kg(-1)) in all cases in frozen samples.",2011,21749250,no
Effect of Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans on pro-inflammatory response in cystic fibrosis epithelium.,The identification of filamentous fungi and/or yeasts in the airway secretions of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) is becoming increasingly prevalent yet the importance of these organisms in relation to underlying inflammation is poorly defined.Cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cells (CFBE) and human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE) were co-incubated with Candida albicans whole cells or Aspergillus fumigatus conidia for 24 h prior to the measurement of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 by ELISA.Treatment of HBE or CFBE with C. albicans whole cells did not alter cytokine secretion. However treatment of CFBE with A. fumigatus conidia resulted in a 1.45-fold increase in IL-6 and a 1.65-fold increase in IL-8 secretion in comparison to basal levels in contrast there was far less secretion from HBE cells.Our data indicate that A. fumigatus infection modulates a pro-inflammatory response in CF epithelial cells while C. albicans does not.,2012,21745765,no
Osmotic stabilizer-coupled suppression of NDR defects is dependent on the calcium-calcineurin signaling cascade in Aspergillus nidulans.,"Establishment and maintenance of cell polarity are coordinated by signaling pathways such as NDR (nuclear Dbf2-related) protein-kinase signaling and calcium signaling pathway. The NDR family of kinase is structurally related to the human myotonic dystrophy kinase, which, when impaired, confers a disease that involves changes in cytoarchitecture and ion homeostasis. CotA kinase, a member of the NDR protein kinase family, forms a complex with MobB to regulate cell polarized growth in Aspergillus nidulans. Our previous study demonstrated that mobB/cotA defects could be suppressed by the osmotic stress in the presence of external calcium. In this study, via the genetic and molecular approach, we further demonstrated that Ca(2+)-permeable stretch-activated nonselective cation channel-MidA, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase catalatic subunit-CnaA and external calcium, but not voltage-gated calcium channel homolog-CchA, were required for the osmotic stabilizer-coupled suppression. The up-regulation of calcium/calcineurin signaling pathway induced by osmotic stress might be the reason for bypassing the requirements of NDR kinase complex, which is otherwise necessary for polar morphogenesis. Our results suggest that calcium-calcineurin signaling pathway coordinates with MobB/CotA kinase complex in regulating polarity growth via maintaining cellular calcium homeostasis. However, CchA may act differently as other components in calcium signaling pathway in Aspergillus nidulans. These findings provide an excellent opportunity to identify the potential pathway linking NDR protein-kinase network to calcium signaling pathway.",2011,21741477,no
Monoclonal antibodies to hyphal exoantigens derived from the opportunistic pathogen Aspergillus terreus.,"Aspergillus terreus has been difficult to identify in cases of aspergillosis, and clinical identification has been restricted to the broad identification of aspergillosis lesions in affected organs or the detection of fungal carbohydrates. As a result, there is a clinical need to identify species-specific biomarkers that can be used to detect invasive A. terreus disease. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were developed to a partially purified preparation of cytolytic hyphal exoantigens (HEA) derived from A. terreus culture supernatant (CSN). Twenty-three IgG1 isotype murine MAbs were developed and tested for cross-reactivity against hyphal extracts of 54 fungal species. Sixteen MAbs were shown to be specific for A. terreus. HEA were detected in conidia, hyphae, and in CSN of A. terreus. HEA were expressed in high levels in the hyphae during early stages of A. terreus growth at 37°C, whereas at room temperature the expression of HEA peaked by days 4 to 5. Expression kinetics of HEA in CSN showed a lag, with peak levels at later time points at room temperature and 37°C than in hyphal extracts. Serum spiking experiments demonstrated that human serum components do not inhibit detection of the HEA epitopes by MAb enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immunoprecipitation and proteomic analysis demonstrated that MAbs 13E11 and 12C4 immunoprecipitated a putative uncharacterized leucine aminopeptidase (Q0CAZ7), while MAb 19B2 recognized a putative dipeptidyl-peptidase V (DPP5). Studies using confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that the uncharacterized leucine aminopeptidase mostly localized to extracellular matrix structures while dipeptidyl-peptidase V was mostly confined to the cytoplasm.",2012,21734068,no
Pre-emptive diagnosis and treatment of fungal infections--evaluation of a single-centre policy.,"Invasive fungal disease (IFD) remains a significant cause of mortality in haematology patients. Management strategies range from empiric therapy to pre-emptive approaches. Prophylaxis with mould-active agents has been evaluated, but the optimal strategy remains unclear. We present here a retrospective analysis of the pre-emptive strategy implemented at our institution. We analysed 348 consecutive neutropenic episodes in 234 patients. The main elements of our pre-emptive strategy included twice-weekly Galactomannan testing and weekly computed tomography (CT) scan. Antifungal prophylaxis usually consisted of fluconazole (400 mg once weekly). Antifungal treatment was started if criteria for IFD (including possible) were fulfilled. Along with the incidence of antifungal treatment and IFD, we also analysed the adherence to the strategy. Adherence was good but suboptimal with 81% of CT scans having been performed at an interval of 10 days or less. Concerning antifungal treatment, in 56 episodes the patient was receiving a mould-active agent as secondary prophylaxis. Antifungal treatment was started during 39% of the remaining episodes. In all, 109 cases of IFD were diagnosed, 51 being probable or proven. Forty-nine patients died before day 100, IFD directly caused or contributed to death in six patients. Two cases of IFD were diagnosed post-mortem and were missed by our pre-emptive strategy. Our pre-emptive strategy is feasible and safe with an acceptable rate of IFD and associated mortality, while avoiding anti-fungal treatment in a significant proportion of patients. The exact role of pre-emptive treatment compared with systematic mould-active prophylaxis can only be determined in a well-designed randomized trial.",2012,21729194,no
"Expression, purification and characterization of two thermostable endoglucanases cloned from a lignocellulosic decomposing fungi Aspergillus fumigatus Z5 isolated from compost.","Two genes encoding endoglucanase, designated as egl2 and egl3, were cloned from a lignocellulosic decomposing fungus Aspergillus fumigatus Z5 and were successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris X33. The deduced amino acid sequences encoded by egl2 and egl3 showed strong similarity with the sequence of glycoside hydrolase family 5. SDS-PAGE and western blot assays indicated that the recombinant enzymes were secreted into the culture medium and the zymogram analysis confirmed that both recombinant enzymes had endoglucanase activity. Several biochemical properties of the two recombinant enzymes were studied: Egl2 and Egl3 showed optimal activity at pH 5.0 and 4.0, respectively, and at 50 and 60°C, respectively. Egl2 and Egl3 showed good pH stability in the range of 4-7, and both enzymes demonstrated good thermostability ranging from 30 to 60°C. The K(m) and V(max) values using carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC, soluble cellulose, polymerized by β-1, 4-linked glucose residues) as the substrate at optimal conditions were determined. The activities of the enzymes on a variety of cello-oligosaccharide substrates were investigated, and Egl2 can hydrolyze cellotetraose and cellopentaose but not cellobiose and cellotriose, whereas Egl3 can hydrolyze all cello-oligosaccharides, except cellobiose.",2011,21708265,no
A novel monoclonal antibody specific to mouse IL-17.,"IL-17 is secreted by T helper (Th) 17 cells, and might play important roles in host defense against extracellular bacterial infection and fungal infection and contribute to the pathogenesis of various autoimmune inflammatory diseases. Here we have, for the first time, generated the monoclonal antibody against the rat IL-17 protein, which is secreted by T helper (Th) 17 cells. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western immunoblotting were used to screen the hybridomas. As a result, one MAb named Y11 (IgG1) was characterized, which was effective in detecting the recombinant and the cellular protein. Then the MAb was used to detect the expression of IL-17 in rat intestine graft tissues by immunohistochemical analysis.

[Cardiac invasive aspergillosis in a heart transplant recipient].,"Solid organ transplant recipients are a population at risk of invasive aspergillosis. The lung and the central nervous system are usually affected.We report the case of a patient with proven cardiac invasive aspergillosis two years after heart transplantation, and perform a review of cardiac aspergillosis in solid organ transplant recipients.A 52-year old woman received a heart transplant. Several complications appeared in the post-operative period, including the development of invasive aspergillosis in the surgical wound. She was readmitted two years later with dyspnea. A thoracic CT-scan revealed multiple lung embolisms and a mass in the retroxiphoid, invading the right atrium and the tricuspid valve. Septated hyphae invading this tissue were observed and Aspergillus fumigatus was subsequently isolated. Serum galactomannan determinations were negative. Antifungal therapy with voriconazole was started. Two months later, the patient visited the hospital for a routine check-up control in good clinical condition, but with undetectable voriconazole serum levels. These levels were associated to the concomitant use of omeprazole. One year later, the patient was still receiving voriconazole and remained asymptomatic.Invasive aspergillosis affecting the mediastinum can progress and affect the heart tissues.

The patient is a 58-year-old woman presenting a deterioration of the general state associated with repeating hemoptysis, dyspnea, dysphagia, sclérodactylia, generalized cutaneous sclerosis and Raynaud's phenomenon. There was no antecedent pulmonary tuberculosis. The patient had a pulmonary arterial hypertension complicated by a chronic pulmonary heart at the stage of right cardiac decompensation. Aspergillosis serology was positive and the immunological assessment confirmed scleroderma. The computed tomography showed a huge oblong opacity in a small round bell shape (""signe du grelot"", Monad's sign) in the left upper lobe developed within a bronchiectasis, and a bilateral pulmonary fibrosis. Although surgery remains the recommended treatment of an aspergilloma, the management of our patient was medical in front of contra-indication for surgery.

The management of this entity remains difficult and complicated the prognosis is in general unfavourable and depends at the same time on the evolution of scleroderma and the aspergilloma infection.",2012,21698483,no
"Efficacy and safety of micafungin as an empirical therapy for invasive fungal infections in patients with hematologic disorders: a multicenter, prospective study.","This study was conducted as a prospective, multicenter trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of micafungin as an empirical therapy for suspected invasive fungal infections (IFIs), including febrile neutropenia (FN), and to evaluate the usefulness of β-D: -glucan (BG) and Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) antigen in patients with hematologic diseases. A total of 121 patients were enrolled and assessed for safety, and 119 were examined for clinical efficacy. The main underlying diseases were acute myeloid leukemia (38.0%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (18.2%), and malignant lymphoma (18.2%). The median initial daily dose and duration of micafungin treatment were 150 mg/day and 13 days, respectively. The overall response rate for suspected IFIs (n = 119), based on four composite endpoints, including baseline IFI, breakthrough IFIs (proven and probable), survival, and premature discontinuation, was 79.0%. In addition, the response rate for FN (n = 81), based on these four endpoints as well as defervescence during neutropenia, was 39.5%. Breakthrough IFIs (proven, probable, and possible) occurred in five patients during micafungin treatment. All of these patients were positive for either BG or GM before the breakthrough IFIs. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) associated with micafungin was 10.7% and most were mild. The majority of AEs were liver dysfunction. These results indicate the effectiveness and safety of micafungin as an empirical therapy for suspected IFIs, including FN, and the usefulness of monitoring both BG and GM to detect breakthrough IFIs.",2011,21695388,no
Induction of mucin and MUC5AC expression by the protease activity of Aspergillus fumigatus in airway epithelial cells.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis, characterized by excessive mucus secretion, airflow limitation, bronchiectasis, and peripheral blood eosinophilia, is predominantly caused by a fungal pathogen, Aspergillus fumigatus. Using DNA microarray analysis of NCI-H292 cells, a human bronchial epithelial cell line, stimulated with fungal extracts from A. fumigatus, Alternaria alternata, or Penicillium notatum, we identified a mucin-related MUC5AC as one of the genes, the expression of which was selectively induced by A. fumigatus. Quantitative RT-PCR, ELISA, and histochemical analyses confirmed an induction of mucin and MUC5AC expression by A. fumigatus extracts or the culture supernatant of live microorganisms in NCI-H292 cells and primary cultures of airway epithelial cells. The expression of MUC5AC induced by A. fumigatus extracts diminished in the presence of neutralizing Abs or of inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor or its ligand, TGF-α. We also found that A. fumigatus extracts activated the TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE), critical for the cleavage of membrane-bound pro-TGF-α, and its inhibition with low-molecular weight inhibitors or small interfering RNA suppressed the expression of MUC5AC. The protease activity of A. fumigatus extracts was greater than that of other fungal extracts, and treatment with a serine protease inhibitor, but not with a cysteine protease inhibitor, eliminated its ability to activate TACE or induce the expression of MUC5AC mRNA in NCI-H292. In conclusion, the prominent serine protease activity of A. fumigatus, which caused the overproduction of mucus by the bronchial epithelium via the activation of the TACE/TGF-α/epidermal growth factor receptor pathway, may be a pathogenetic mechanism of allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis.",2011,21685325,no
The inflammasome drives protective Th1 and Th17 cellular responses in disseminated candidiasis.,"The Nlrp3 inflammasome has been proposed to play an important role in antifungal host defense. However, studies exploring the role of the inflammasome in antifungal host defense have been limited to the direct effects on IL-1β processing. Although IL-1β has important direct effects on the innate immune response, important effects of the caspase-1-dependent cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 are exerted on the initiation of the adaptive Th1 and Th17 cellular responses. No studies have been employed to assess the impact of the inflammasome on the Th1/Th17 defense mechanisms in vivo during candidiasis. In the present study, we demonstrate an essential role for caspase-1 and ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain) in disseminated candidiasis through regulating antifungal Th1 and Th17 responses. Caspase-1(-/-) and ASC(-/-) mice display diminished Th1/Th17 responses, followed by increased fungal outgrowth and lower survival. These observations identify a critical role for the inflammasome in controlling protective adaptive immune responses during invasive fungal infection.",2011,21681738,no
Optimization of xylanase production from Aspergillus niger for biobleaching of eucalyptus pulp.,"A crude endo-xylanase produced by Aspergillus niger BCC14405 was investigated for its potential in pre-bleaching of chemical pulp from eucalyptus. The optimal fermentation conditions on the basis of optimization using response surface methodology included cultivation in a complex medium comprising wheat bran, rice bran, and soybean meal supplemented with yeast extract, glucose, peptone, and lactose with a starting pH of 6.0 for 7 d. This resulted in production of 89.5 IU/mL of xylanase with minor cellulase activity. Proteomic analysis using LC/MS/MS revealed that the crude enzyme was a composite of hemicellulolytic enzymes, including endo-β-1,4-xylanase and other hemicellulolytic enzymes attacking arabinoxylan and mannan. Pretreatment of the pulp at a xylanase dosage of 10 IU/g increased the brightness ceiling after the C-Eop-H bleaching step up to 3.0% using a chlorine charge with a C-factor of 0.16-0.20. Xylanase treatment also led to reduction in chlorine charge of at least 20%, with an acceptable brightness level. The enzyme pretreatment resulted in a slight increase in pulp viscosity, suggesting an increase in relative cellulose content. The crude enzyme was potent in the enzyme-aided bleaching of chemical pulp in an environmentally friendly pulping process.",2011,21670524,no
Epidemiological trends in invasive aspergillosis in France: the SAIF network (2005-2007).,"A prospective (2005-2007) hospital-based multicentre surveillance of EORTC/MSG-proven or probable invasive aspergillosis (IA) cases whatever the underlying diseases was implemented in 12 French academic hospitals. Admissions per hospital and transplantation procedures were obtained. Cox regression models were used to determine risk factors associated with the 12-week overall mortality. With 424 case-patients included, the median incidence/hospital was 0.271/10(3) admissions (range 0.072-0.910) without significant alteration of incidence and seasonality over time. Among the 393 adults (62% men, 56 years (16-84 years)), 15% had proven IA, 78% haematological conditions, and 92.9% had lung involvement. Acute leukaemia (34.6%) and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (21.4%) were major host factors, together with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (21.6%), which emerged as a new high-risk group. The other risk host factors consisted of solid organ transplantation (8.7%), solid tumours (4.3%), systemic inflammatory diseases (4.6%) and chronic respiratory diseases (2.3%). Serum galactomannan tests were more often positive (≥69%) for acute leukaemia and allogeneic stem cell transplantation than for the others (<42% p <10(-3)). When positive (n = 245), cultures mainly yielded Aspergillus fumigatus (79.7%). First-line antifungal therapy consisted of voriconazole, caspofungin, lipid formulations of amphotericin, or any combination therapy (52%, 14%, 8% and 19.9%, respectively). Twelve-week overall mortality was 44.8% (95% CI, 39.8-50.0)",2012,21668573,no
Fungal pneumonia in patients with hematologic malignancies: current approach and management.,"Fungal pneumonia is the most frequent presentation of invasive mold infections (IMIs) in patients with hematologic malignancies. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of fungal pneumonia and improvement in the outcome of such patients.The epidemiology of IMIs in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients has evolved in response to changes in conditioning regimens, increasing use of alternative sources of stem cells and antifungal prophylaxis, among other factors. PCR analysis and serologic tests, used in combination with imaging findings, have improved the timing and accuracy of diagnosis of these infections.Recent guidelines incorporated evidence-based treatment recommendations however, application in real world situations is often difficult. A new treatment approach known as preemptive therapy, based on screening with biomarkers combined with early clinical and imaging findings, is being compared with the traditional empirical therapy in neutropenic patients with persistent or recurrent fever. The use of new triazoles and prompt diagnosis has contributed to improved outcomes in these patients. In addition, therapeutic drug monitoring may be useful when administering voriconazole.Evidence-based diagnosis and treatment of fungal pneumonia in patients with hematologic malignancies are becoming increasingly institution-specific and patient-specific, integrating host factors, new diagnostic methods, and epidemiologic and pharmacologic considerations.",2011,21666457,no
Resolution of galactomannan antigenemia in a patient receiving oral voriconazole for chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis.,"The serologic markers of the therapeutic response of chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis (CNPA) are rarely reported. Here, we describe the changes in galactomannan (GM) antigenemia in a patient receiving oral voriconazole for CNPA, in whom a resolution of GM antigenemia to a normal level was associated with clinical improvements. The serum GM index can be an adjunctive tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of the therapeutic response of CNPA.",2011,21658879,no
Generation of a multipathogen-specific T-cell product for adoptive immunotherapy based on activation-dependent expression of CD154.,"Viral and fungal infections remain a leading cause of mortality in patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Adoptive transfer of multipathogen-specific T cells is promising in restoring immunity and thereby preventing and treating infections, but approaches are currently limited because of time-consuming and laborious procedures. Therefore, we investigated a new strategy to simultaneously select T cells specific for viral and fungal pathogens based on activation-dependent expression of CD154. Single- and multipathogen-specific T-cell lines with high specificity for adenovirus (AdV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Candida albicans, and/or Aspergillus fumigatus could be readily generated within 14 days irrespective of the precursor frequency. The T-cell lines responded reproducibly to endogenously processed antigen and specifically proliferated upon antigenic stimulation. Although isolation based on CD154 favors enrichment of CD4(+) T cells, AdV-, EBV- and CMV-specific CD8(+) T cells could be expanded and demonstrated lysis of target cells. Conversely, T cell-mediated alloreactivity was almost abrogated compared with the starting fraction. This selection and/or expansion strategy may form the basis for future adoptive immunotherapy trials in patients at risk for multiple infections and may be translated to other antigens.",2011,21642594,no
Targeting ST2L potentiates CpG-mediated therapeutic effects in a chronic fungal asthma model.,"IL-33 and its soluble receptor and cell-associated receptor (ST2L) are all increased in clinical and experimental asthma. The present study addressed the hypothesis that ST2L impairs the therapeutic effects of CpG in a fungal model of asthma. C57BL/6 mice were sensitized to Aspergillus fumigatus and challenged via i.t. instillation with live A. fumigatus conidia. Mice were treated with IgG alone, anti-ST2L monoclonal antibody (mAb) alone, CpG alone, IgG plus CpG, or anti-ST2L mAb plus CpG every other day from day 14 to day 28 and investigated on day 28 after conidia. Lung ST2L and toll-like receptor 9 protein expression levels concomitantly increased in a time-dependent manner during fungal asthma. Therapeutic blockade of ST2L with an mAb attenuated key pathological features of this model. At subtherapeutic doses, neither anti-ST2L mAb nor CpG alone affected fungal asthma severity. However, airway hyperresponsiveness, mucus cell metaplasia, peribronchial fibrosis, and fungus retention were markedly reduced in asthmatic mice treated with the combination of both. Whole lung CXCL9 levels were significantly elevated in the combination group but not in the controls. Furthermore, in asthmatic mice treated with the combination therapy, dendritic cells generated significantly greater IL-12p70 with CpG in vitro compared with control dendritic cells. The combination of anti-ST2L mAb with CpG significantly attenuated experimental asthma, suggesting that targeting ST2L might enhance the therapeutic efficacy of CpG during allergic inflammation.",2011,21640974,no
Fungal DNA and pet allergen levels in Swedish day care centers and associations with building characteristics.,"Pet allergens and mold growth related to damp are common phenomena in day care centers in Sweden but exposure measurements of these factors are lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between building construction and indoor environment quality in Swedish day care centers and the potential for exposure to fungi (analyzed by quantitative PCR) and animal allergens (analyzed by ELISA). Measurements were performed in 21 day care centers (103 rooms) from one municipality in Sweden, which were identified as constructions at risk of dampness (85% of the buildings) and with visible damage and mold growth (54% of the buildings). Dust samples were collected using cotton swab and Petri dishes. Total fungal DNA was detected in 99% and 100%, Aspergillus/Penicillium DNA in 54% and 68%, and Stachybotrys chartarum DNA in 4% and 9% of the investigated rooms in cotton swab and Petri dish samples, respectively. The total fungal DNA levels (Geometric Mean, GM) were 4.2 × 10(6) cell equivalents per m(2) and 2.9 × 10(5) cell equivalents per m(2) per day in the swab and Petri dish samples, respectively. The concentrations (GM) of cat (Fel d1), dog (Can f1), and horse (Equ cx) allergens were 9.4, 7.2 ng m(-2) day(-1), and 5.0 unit per m(2) per day, respectively. Total fungal DNA levels were higher in risk construction buildings (p = 0.01), in rooms with linoleum flooring material (p = 0.003), and in buildings with rotating heat exchangers (p = 0.02). There were associations between total fungal DNA levels and cat (p = 0.02), dog (p < 0.001), and horse (p = 0.001) allergens. In conclusion, risk constructions, damp constructions, mould growth, fungal DNA, and animal allergens were common exposure factors in Swedish day care centers. Building constructions that represent a high risk for internal dampness should be avoided in the future, and measures to reduce allergen levels should be considered to protect pet-allergic children from asthmatic problems.",2011,21637862,no
"Characterization of the 41kDa allergen Asp v 13, a subtilisin-like serine protease from Aspergillus versicolor.","Aspergillus versicolor is common on moldy building materials. Asp v 13, the principal allergen is produced by strains collected from across Canada. In this paper, we report a 1833bp Asp v 13 open reading frame predicted to encode a protein of 403 amino acids in length with three introns. A BLAST search of Asp v 13, a phylogenic tree calculation and alignment with its homologous proteins from other species indicated that Asp v 13 is a secretory, subtilisin-like serine protease widely distributed in Aspergillus species. His-tagged Asp v 13 was over-expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using Ni-NTA columns with a yield of 1mg/L. Based on immuno binding assay of recombinant protein both antibodies developed against the natural protein, and human sera IgE, the recombinant protein was similar to the natural form. Six IgE- and seven IgG-binding epitopes were also identified with selected human sera along the entire amino acid sequence of Asp v 13. Most residues binding these epitopes are exposed on the surface and correspond to charged regions of the molecule.",2011,21632114,no
Intensive care unit experience of haemopoietic stem cell transplant patients.,"Previous research at our institution (1988-1998) established an intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital mortality between 70% and 80% in haemopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients requiring ICU admission.This study explored mortality in a more contemporary cohort while comparing outcomes to published literature and our previous experience.Retrospective chart review of HSCT patients admitted to ICU between December 1998 and June 2008.Of 146 admissions, 53% were male, with a mean age of 44 years, an Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 28 and Sepsis Organ Failure Assessment score of 11. Fifty-six per cent had graft versus host disease (GVHD), with respiratory failure (67%) being the most common admission diagnosis. All but one received mechanical ventilation. The ICU and hospital mortality were 42% (72% 1988-1998 cohort) and 64% (82% 1998-1998 cohort) respectively. The 6- and 12-month survivals were 29% and 24% respectively for the 1998-2008 cohort. Dying in ICU was independently predicted by fungal infection (P= 0.02) and early onset of organ failure (P < 0.001), while GVHD (P= 0.04) predicted survival. Mortality at 12 months was independently predicted by the acute physiology score (P= 0.002), increasing number of organ failures (P= 0.001), and cytomegalovirus positive serology (P= 0.005), while blood stream infection (P= 0.003), an antibiotic change on admission to the ICU (P= 0.007) and a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (P= 0.02) predicted survival.Our study found that acute admission of HSCT patients to the ICU is associated with improved survival compared to our previous experience, with organ failure progression a strong predictor of ICU outcome, and specific disease characteristics contributing to long-term survival.",2013,21627739,no
Chronic granulomatous disease of childhood: an unusual cause of recurrent uncommon infections in a 61-year-old man.,"Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare congenital immunodeficiency that affects 1 : 250,000 of the population, which is characterized by recurrent bacterial and fungal infections and by granuloma formation. We investigated a 61-year-old man presented with a 20-year history of a relapsing skin rash appearing as mildly pruritic and erythematous plaques affecting various body regions. Cutaneous biopsies were taken and sent for histology and tissue culture. Leucocyte function was assessed by determining the generation of reactive oxygen species. Bactericidal activity was assessed in the presence of autologous and homologous sera. Western blotting was performed for protein analysis of the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase system, and mutation screening was carried out using PCR amplification and sequence analysis. Examination of biopsies obtained from lesional skin indicated a suppurative granulomatous process. Tissue cultures grew Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus fumigatus (confirmed by PCR). A. nidulans has often been associated with CGD, and the leucocyte function tests supported this diagnosis. Direct DNA sequencing led to the identification of a hemizygous missense novel mutation in CYBB (c.907C>T), which predicts a p.His303Tyr amino-acid substitution in gp91-phox, thus confirming the diagnosis of CGD. In conclusion, we report a case of a rare inherited immunodeficiency, CGD, in a 61-year-old man, and describe the novel hemizygous missense mutation underlying the condition. Mild forms of usually fatal immunodeficiencies should be considered when assessing the occurrence of unusual infectious diseases in apparently healthy people.",2011,21623884,no
Invasive Myceliophthora thermophila infection mimicking invasive aspergillosis in a neutropenic patient: a new cause of cross-reactivity with the Aspergillus galactomannan serum antigen assay.,Myceliophthora thermophila is a thermophilic mould widely found in the environment but rarely responsible for human infections. We describe a case of invasive Myceliophthora thermophila infection mimicking invasive aspergillosis in a neutropenic patient with haematological malignancy. Cross-reactivity with Aspergillus galactomannan assay (GM) was demonstrated by repeated positive results and confirmed by cross-reaction between the fungal isolate and the GM assay. The patient was successfully treated with voriconazole. Potential GM cross-reactivity must be considered in future studies including patients categorized as having probable invasive aspergillosis using the GM as the only mycological criterion.,2014,21619496,no
Determination of Ochratoxin A in apples contaminated with Aspergillus ochraceus by using a microfluidic competitive immunosensor with magnetic nanoparticles.,"Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin produced by filamentous fungi of the genus Aspergillus and Penicillium that presents carcinogenic, teratogenic and nephrotoxic properties. In this work, we have developed, characterized and applied an immunoassay methodology comprised of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as platform for immobilizing bioactive materials incorporated into a microfluidic system for rapid and sensitive quantification of Ochratoxin A (OTA) in apples (Red Delicious) contaminated with Aspergillus ochraceus. The sensor has the potential for automation and the detection of OTA was carried out using a competitive indirect immunoassay method based on the use of anti-OTA monoclonal antibodies immobilized on 3-aminopropyl-modified MNPs. The total assay time into the microfluidic competitive immunosensor was 16 min, and the calculated detection limit was 0.05 µg kg(-1). Moreover, the intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were below 6.5%. The proposed method can be a very promising analytical tool for the determination of OTA in apparently healthy fruits post-harvest and for its application in the agricultural industry.",2011,21611646,no
Serum galactomannan strongly correlates with outcome of invasive aspergillosis in acute leukaemia patients.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) remains an important cause of mortality in acute leukaemia patients. Previous studies reported that serum galactomannan (GM) levels correlate strongly with IA outcomes in patients with haematological cancers. This study aimed to clarify the usefulness of serial GM testing for outcome evaluation of IA in acute leukaemia patients. We retrospectively analysed 58 acute leukaemia patients who had IA during neutropenic period after chemotherapy and whose serum GM was serially monitored until discharge or death. The kappa correlation coefficient was used to determine the strength of correlation between GM and clinical outcome (survival or death) of IA. The correlation between clinical outcome and GM kinetics was good at week 6 [κ = 0.663, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.465-0.861] and excellent at week 12 (κ = 0.819, 95% CI: 0.667-0.91). Survival was significantly better in patients whose GM values normalised than in patients with persistently positive GM (P < 0.0001) regardless of whether neutropenia resolved or acute leukaemia responded to chemotherapy. In neutropenic patients with acute leukaemia, serum GM correlated strongly with survival outcome of IA. This finding further supports the usefulness of the GM index as a surrogate marker for assessing IA outcome and the need for serial GM testing in therapeutic monitoring.",2012,21605195,no
Studies on galactofuranose-containing glycostructures of the pathogenic mold Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Galactofuranose is a hexose that is exclusively found in microbes and in particular in certain pathogenic species. In the mold Aspergillus fumigatus, it is the characteristic constituent of the cell wall component galactomannan. Detection of this carbohydrate is currently a widespread method used for diagnosis of systemic A. fumigatus infections. In this study, we raised and characterized 2 monoclonal antibodies that specifically react with galactofuranose-containing glycostructures. We investigated the distribution of surface-accessible galactomannan on different A. fumigatus morphotypes. We provide evidence that the antibodies recognize distinct antigens and are suitable to detect A. fumigatus hyphae in immunohistology. A mutant that is impaired in synthesis of galactofuranose stimulated a normal cytokine response in murine macrophages, which argues against galactomannan being a relevant PAMP, at least in mice. Purified galactomannan-specific monoclonal IgM L10-1 failed to inhibit the hyphal growth under in vitro conditions, but L10-1 binding to hyphae led to an enhanced deposition of the complement protein C1q. However, administration of purified L10-1 antibodies prior to infection was not able to protect mice. In conclusion, we have found no evidence for galactomannan being a relevant A. fumigatus PAMP and describe 2 novel galactomannan antibodies that might be valuable tools for the diagnosis of A. fumigatus infections and further analysis of the biological significance of galactomannan.",2011,21601522,no
Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) modulates immune responses to Aspergillus fumigatus during fungal asthma in mice.,"Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) expression is increased during pulmonary fungal infection suggesting that this receptor might be involved in anti-fungal immune responses. To address the role of TREM-1 in a murine model of fungal allergic airway disease, A. fumigatus-sensitized CBA/J mice received by intratracheal injection a mixture of live A. fumigatus conidia and one of a control adenovirus vector (Ad70), an adenovirus containing a gene encoding for the extracellular domain of mouse TREM-1 and the F(c) portion of human IgG (AdTREM-1Ig a soluble inhibitor of TREM-1 function), or an adenovirus containing mouse DAP12 (AdDAP12",2012,21592044,no
Legionella jordanis in hematopoietic SCT patients radiographically mimicking invasive mold infection.,"Opportunistic pulmonary infections are a major cause of post-transplant morbidity and mortality. Among these infections, Aspergillus is a common cause of fatal pneumonia. Owing to the precarious clinical condition of many patients who acquire invasive mold infections, clinicians often treat them on the basis of radiographic findings, such as the halo sign. However, in patients who do not respond to treatment or who have uncommon presentations, bronchoscopy or lung biopsy looking for other pathogens should be considered. This study describes two cases in which the radiographic halo signs characteristic of Aspergillus were in fact due to Legionella jordanis, a pathogen that has been culture proven only in two patients previously (both of whom had underlying lung pathology) and diagnosed by serologic evidence in several other patients. In immunocompromised patients, Legionella can present as a cavitary lesion. Thus, presumptive treatment for this organism should be considered in post-transplant patients who do not have a classic presentation for invasive fungal infection and/or who fail to respond to conventional treatment. These cases illustrate the importance of obtaining tissue cultures to differentiate among the wide variety of pathogens present in this patient population.",2012,21572462,no
"Antifungal treatment strategies in patients with haematological diseases or cancer: from prophylaxis to empirical, pre-emptive and targeted therapy.","Immunocompromised patients have a high risk for invasive fungal diseases (IFDs). These infections are mostly life-threatening and an early diagnosis and initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy are essential for the clinical outcome. Empirical treatment is regarded as the standard of care for granulocytopenic patients who remain febrile despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, this strategy can bear a risk of overtreatment and subsequently induce toxicities and unnecessary treatment costs. Pre-emptive antifungal therapy is now increasingly used to close the time gap between delayed initiation for proven disease and empirical treatment for anticipated infection without further laboratory or radiological evidence of fungal disease. Currently, some new non-invasive microbiological and laboratory methods, like the Aspergillus-galactomannan sandwich-enzyme immunoassay (Aspergillus GM-ELISA), 1,3-β-D-glucan assay or PCR techniques have been developed for a better diagnosis and determination of target patients. The current diagnostic approaches to fungal infections and the role of the revised definitions for invasive fungal infections, now IFDs, will be discussed in this review as well as old and emerging approaches to empirical, pre-emptive and targeted antifungal therapies in patients with haemato-oncological malignancies.",2012,21554421,no
"Antifungal effectiveness of potassium sorbate incorporated in edible coatings against spoilage molds of apples, cucumbers, and tomatoes during refrigerated storage.","Predominant spoilage molds of fresh apples, cucumbers, and tomatoes stored at 4 °C were isolated and examined for resistance to potassium sorbate (PS) incorporated in polysaccharide edible coatings. The isolated molds were Penicillium expansum, Cladosporium herbarum, and Aspergillus niger from apples. P. oxalicum and C. cucumerinum were isolated from cucumbers and P. expansium and C. fulvum from tomatoes. Guar gum edible coating incorporated with PS was the most effective mold inhibitor, significantly (P<0.05) reducing the isolated spoilage molds for 20, 15, and 20 d of storage at 4 °C on apples, cucumbers, and tomatoes, respectively. PS incorporated into pea starch edible coating was less effective and selectively inhibited the isolated mold species, causing significant (P<0.05) reduction in mold on apples, cucumbers, and tomatoes counts for 20, 10 to 15, and 15 to 20 d of storage at 4 °C, respectively. The isolated mold species exhibited different resistances to PS incorporated in the edible coatings. The greatest inhibition (2.9 log CFU/g) was obtained with C. herbarum on apples and the smallest (1.1 log CFU/g) was with P. oxalicum on cucumbers and the other isolated mold species exhibited intermediate resistance. The coatings tested, in general, inhibited molds more effectively on apples than on tomatoes and cucumbers. Addition of PS to pea starch and guar gum, edible coatings improved the antifungal activity of PS against isolated spoilage molds on apples, cucumbers, and tomatoes. PS inhibition was most effective against C. herbarum on apples and least effective against P. oxalicum on cucumbers.",2011,21535846,no
Phosphorylation is the major mechanism regulating isocitrate lyase activity in Paracoccidioides brasiliensis yeast cells.,"The glyoxylate cycle plays an essential role for anaplerosis of oxaloacetate during growth of microorganisms on carbon sources such as acetate or fatty acids and has been shown to contribute to virulence of several pathogens. Here, we investigated the transcriptional and post-translational regulation of the glyoxylate cycle key enzyme isocitrate lyase (PbICL) in the human pathogenic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Although sequence analyses on fungal isocitrate lyases revealed a high phylogenetic conservation, their regulation seems to differ significantly. Closely related Aspergillus species regulate the glyoxylate cycle at the transcriptional level, whereas Pbicl was constitutively expressed in yeast cells. However, only low PbICL activity was detected when cells were grown in the presence of glucose. Two-dimensional gel analyses with subsequent antibody hybridization revealed constitutive production of PbICL, but low PbICL activity on glucose coincided with extensive protein phosphorylation. Since an in vitro dephosphorylation of PbICL from glucose grown cells strongly increased ICL activity and resembled the phosphorylation pattern of highly active acetate grown cells, post-translational modification seems the main mechanism regulating PbICL activity in yeast cells. In agreement, a transfer of yeast cells from glucose to acetate medium increased PbICL activity without requirement of de novo protein synthesis. Thus, inactivation of PbICL by phosphorylation is reversible, denoting a new strategy for the rapid adaptation to changing environmental conditions.",2011,21535474,no
Repression of N-glycosylation triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR) and overexpression of cell wall protein and chitin in Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common airborne fungal pathogen, causing fatal invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients. The crude mortality is 60-90 % and remains around 29-42 % even with treatment. The main reason for patient death is the low efficiency of the drug therapies. As protein N-glycosylation is involved in cell wall biogenesis in A. fumigatus, a deeper understanding of its role in cell wall biogenesis will help to develop new drug targets. The Afstt3 gene encodes the essential catalytic subunit of oligosaccharyltransferase, an enzyme complex responsible for the transfer of the N-glycan to nascent polypeptides. To evaluate the role of N-glycosylation in cell wall biosynthesis, we constructed the conditional mutant strain CPR-stt3 by replacing the endogenous promoter of Afstt3 with the nitrogen-dependent niiA promoter. Repression of the Afstt3 gene in the CPR-stt3 strain led to a severe retardation of growth and a slight defect in cell wall integrity (CWI). One of the most interesting findings was that upregulation of the cell wall-related genes was not accompanied by an activation of the MpkA kinase, which has been shown to be a central element in the CWI signalling pathway in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and A. fumigatus. Considering that the unfolded protein response (UPR) was found to be activated, which might upregulate the expression of cell wall protein and chitin, our data suggest that the UPR, instead of the MpkA-dependent CWI signalling pathway, is the major compensatory mechanism induced by repression but not abolition of N-glycosylation in A. fumigatus. Our finding is a key to understanding the complex compensatory mechanisms of cell wall biosynthesis and may provide a new strategy for drug development.",2012,21527474,no
[Current status and future perspectives of invasive fungal infections after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation].,"Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Recently, the epidemiology of IFI has changed notably by evolution in transplantation procedures as well as preventative strategies. Invasive Aspergillosis is the major fungal infection in the patients undergoing HSCT, which mainly occurred during later period of post-HSCT. With the risk factors, such as prolonged neutropenia, graft-versus-host disease and adopted immunosuppressants and so on in HSCT patients, moreover there are the difficult requirement of histopathological specimen and time consuming, few positive blood culture, the attributable mortality still remains high. Hence high-resolution computed tomography, PET/CT and non-culture based adjunctive diagnostic tests, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for galactomannan (GM) and (1, 3)-β-D-glucan have been incorporated into clinical practice, while the molecular detection, like fungal PCR assays have been developed and will bring the earlier, specific diagnosis for IFI. Newer agents with higher efficacy and lower toxicity, such as voriconazole, caspofungin and micafungin are currently being introduced as prophylaxis, while the combination of these agents and immunotherapy are evaluated to be more prospective strategies.

"Current issues in the clinical management of invasive aspergillosis--the AGIHO, DMykG, ÖGMM and PEG web-based survey and expert consensus conference 2009.","The objectives of this study were to identify unsolved issues in the management of invasive aspergillosis, identify controversies and achieve consensus. The German Speaking Mycological Society (Deutschsprachige Mykologische Gesellschaft, DMykG) invited other German infectious diseases (ID) and mycological societies to submit unsolved issues concerning the diagnosis and treatment of invasive aspergillosis. Based on these contributions, a digital web-based questionnaire of 12 questions on Aspergillus spp. was designed to be completed by experts of the participating societies. Controversial results were identified by a mathematical model and were discussed at a consensus conference during the 43rd Annual Meeting of the DMykG in Cologne, Germany. Forty-two individuals completed the questionnaire. Analysis showed a strong consensus on effective preventive measures, choice of antifungal agents for pre-emptive, empiric and targeted treatment, as well as the evaluation of early chest CT control scans as a measure of treatment response assessment. Opinions on the indication for a pulmonary biopsy of a halo sign in high-risk neutropenic patients and on the role of Aspergillus spp. PCR as well as galactomannan from serum in the assessment of treatment duration diverged in spite of discussion such that a consensus could not be reached. Using a recently published two-step approach - web-based survey plus classical panel discussion - expert consensus was achieved on 10 of 12 questions concerning the diagnosis and treatment of invasive aspergillosis.",2011,21518025,no
Comparison of an Aspergillus real-time polymerase chain reaction assay with galactomannan testing of bronchoalvelolar lavage fluid for the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in lung transplant recipients.,"Early diagnosis and treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) improves outcome.We compared the performance of publicly available pan-Aspergillus, Aspergillus fumigatus-, and Aspergillus terreus-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays with the Platelia galactomannan (GM) assay in 150 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from lung transplant recipients (16 proven/probable IPA, 26 Aspergillus colonization, 11 non-Aspergillus mold colonization, and 97 negative controls).The sensitivity and specificity of pan-Aspergillus PCR (optimal quantification cycle [Cq], ≤35.0 by receiver operating characteristic analysis) and GM (≥.5) for diagnosing IPA were 100% (95% confidence interval, 79%-100%) and 88% (79%-92%), and 93% (68%-100%) and 89% (82%-93%), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of A. fumigatus-specific PCR were 85% (55%-89%) and 96% (91%-98%), respectively. A. terreus-specific PCR was positive for the 1 patient with IPA due to this species specificity was 99% (148 of 149 samples). Aspergillus PCR identified 1 patient with IPA not diagnosed by GM. For BAL samples associated with Aspergillus colonization, the specificity of GM (92%) was higher than that of pan-Aspergillus PCR (50%A recently developed pan-Aspergillus PCR assay and GM testing of BAL fluid may facilitate the diagnosis of IPA after lung transplantation. A. fumigatus- and A. terreus-specific real-time PCR assays may be useful in rapidly identifying the most common cause of IPA and a species that is intrinsically resistant to amphotericin B, respectively.",2011,21507918,no
Antifungal prophylaxis during treatment for haematological malignancies: are we there yet?,"Antifungal prophylaxis during treatment for haematological malignancies has been studied for 50 years, yet it has not been wholly effective even when using antifungal drugs that exhibit potent activity in vitro against a broad range of fungal pathogens. Trials have demonstrated that it can reduce the incidence of invasive fungal diseases (IFD) and fungal deaths, but only two studies have had an impact on overall mortality. Furthermore, it has not significantly reduced the need for empirical antifungal therapy. Posaconazole was effective in preventing invasive aspergillosis in two studies of high-risk patients, and consensus guidelines grade it as a suitable choice for antifungal prophylaxis of invasive mould disease however, its bioavailability was compromised by vomiting or diarrhoea so that an alternative parenteral antifungal drug was required. A recent trial of voriconazole prophylaxis after allogeneic stem cell transplantation failed to show superiority over fluconazole. With more accurate definitions of IFD, that utilize fungal biomarkers, such as galactomannan, together with computerized tomographic imaging, there is growing interest in a diagnostic-driven strategy, which could prove to be a more efficacious approach.",2011,21504422,no
Measurement of mycotoxins in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.,"Mycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites produced by a variety of fungi including Aspergillus, Alternaria, and Penicillium species. The presence of mycotoxins in sinonasal tissue and secretions and any possible link to chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) or other diseases of the head and neck have not been reported. The authors performed an exploratory study to determine the presence and levels of mycotoxins in the sinonasal tissue and secretions of 18 subjects undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery for CRS. Using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits, samples were analyzed for the following mycotoxins: aflatoxin, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, ochratoxin, and fumonisin. All specimens were negative for aflatoxin, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, and fumonisin. Four (22%) of 18 specimens were positive for ochratoxin. The clinical significance of this finding remains to be determined.",2011,21493263,no
"Retrospective assessment of β-D-(1,3)-glucan for presumptive diagnosis of fungal infections.","β-D-(1,3)-glucan (BG) is a component of the cell walls of many fungal organisms. Our aims were to investigate the feasibility of the BG assay and its contribution to early diagnosis of different types of invasive fungal infections (IFI) commonly diagnosed in a tertiary care centre. The BG serum levels of 28 patients diagnosed with six IFI [13 probable invasive aspergillosis (IA), 2 proven IA, 2 zygomycosis, 3 fusariosis, 3 cryptococcosis, 3 candidaemia and 2 pneumocystosis] were retrospectively evaluated. The kinetic variations in BG serum levels from the 15 patients diagnosed with IA were compared with those of the galactomannan antigen (GM). In 5/15 cases of IA, BG was positive earlier than GM (time lapse from 4 to 30 days), in 8/15 cases, BG was positive at the same time as GM and, in 2/15 cases, BG was positive after GM. For the five other fungal diseases, BG was highly positive at the period of diagnosis except for the two cases of zygomycosis and one of the three cases of fusariosis. This study, which reflects the common activity of a tertiary care centre, confirms that BG detection could be of interest for IFI screening in patients with haematological malignancies.",2011,21492228,no
"[Epidemiological, clinical, therapeutic and evolutionary aspects of pulmonary aspergilloma in Dakar].","The presentation of pulmonary aspergilloma is dominated by haemoptysis, the results of medical treatment are disappointing and there is significant morbidity and mortality following surgery the only really curative treatment. These facts emphasise the gravity of this condition. We undertook a study to estimate the current profile of the disease and its management in Senegal.A retrospective study took place between January 2004 and September 2008 including all the cases of pulmonary aspergilloma diagnosed in private practice and\or the thoracic and cardiovascular surgery service of the Fann Hospital, Dakar.Thirty-five patient records were collected. The sex ratio was four males to one female. The average age of the patients was 43.7 years. All the patients had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis. Serology was positive for Aspergillus fumigatus at 22 patients out of 29 (75.86%). Histological examination of surgical biopsies confirmed the diagnosis in 88.46%. The treatment was essentially surgical with no recorded mortality. Nine cases of haemorrhage and eight of suppuration were reported.Surgery remains the reference treatment for pulmonary aspergilloma. In view of the morbidity of this condition we emphasize the importance of early screening and correct treatment of tuberculosis, particularly in endemic countries, to achieve clinical cure and prevent serious after effects.",2011,21482335,no
"Best practice in treating infants and children with proven, probable or suspected invasive fungal infections.","Invasive fungal infections are an escalating problem in paediatrics. The purpose of this review is to update the recent evidence on antifungal treatment options as well as to provide an outline of best practices in treating children.Candida and Aspergillus species are the leading causes of invasive fungal infections in paediatric patients. Invasive fungal infections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality and preemptive antifungal therapy has been found to improve survival. Although novel antifungal agents (echinocandins and second generation triazoles) and treatment strategies based on surrogate markers (galactomannan and beta-glucan) have established utility in treating adults, limited data are available to guide paediatricians when managing children with invasive fungal infections. The collective findings of the up-to-date data show that treatment recommendations are similar for paediatric and adult patients. Progress has been made in describing pharmacokinetics and safety of voriconazole and echinocandins, respectively, while further efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic trials are ongoing.The current guidelines, proposed mainly for adults with invasive fungal infections, are likely applicable also to paediatric patients, but prior to making definitive recommendations more pharmacokinetic and phase III trials are needed.",2011,21455060,no
Evaluation of analytical and preliminary clinical performance of Myconostica MycAssay Aspergillus when testing serum specimens for diagnosis of invasive Aspergillosis.,"Diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis remains a significant problem. PCR testing may aid diagnosis but is not yet included in disease-defining criteria due to a lack of standardization of assays and methodologies. This study investigated the analytical performance and the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the Myconostica MycAssay Aspergillus PCR (MAP) assay compared to those of a validated in-house Aspergillus PCR (IHP) test when testing serum specimens. Serum specimens spiked with Aspergillus genomic DNA had a limit of detection equivalent to 5 genomes and a linear dynamic range of 5 to >5 × 10(4) genomes for both assays. When testing clinical specimens (n = 170), the MAP assay had a sensitivity of 60 to 70% and a specificity of 90.5 to 100%. The IHP assay had a sensitivity of 50 to 80% and a specificity of 100%. A commercially available Aspergillus PCR assay provides a methodology that is standardized and reagents that are quality controlled. This facilitates multicenter evaluation of the clinical utility of PCR diagnosis. The performance of the MAP assay is comparable to that of the IHP assay and to those in previously reported studies evaluating commercial tests (galactomannan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay).",2011,21450965,no
Pulmonary aspergilloma mimicking metastasis from papillary thyroid cancer.,"Whole-body scans (WBSs) based on diagnostic or therapeutic doses of I-131 can visualize metastatic lesions in thyroid cancer patients who have undergone total thyroidectomy. However, a variety of unusual lesions may cause false-positive results, and therefore, careful evaluation of abnormal scans is imperative to avoid unnecessary surgical removal or high-dose radioiodine treatment. Here, we report a patient with pulmonary aspergilloma mimicking metastasis of thyroid cancer on WBS.A 53-year-old woman with papillary thyroid cancer stage III (T1N1aM0) who had undergone total thyroidectomy and 150 mCi of radioiodine treatment for remnant ablation was found to have focal intense radioiodine accumulation in the left lung field by WBS, suggestive of pulmonary metastasis, at 5 days after I-131 administration. Whole-body F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) and Tc-99m methoxyisobutyl isonitrile scans showed no remarkable tracer accumulation at the pulmonary nodule. An enhanced chest CT scan demonstrated a nonenhancing pulmonary nodule with an air-crescent sign suggestive of pulmonary fungus ball. A subsequent blood test for precipitating antibodies to Aspergillus antigens produced a result of 29.9 U/mL (reference range: 0-8 U/mL). The patient was clinically diagnosed as having pulmonary aspergilloma based on serologic test and radiologic imaging results.Extreme caution should be exercised when interpreting abnormal radioiodine WBS findings when the serum thyroglobulin is normal and imaging characteristics indicate a benign condition. Pulmonary aspergilloma is a cause of a false-positive lesion when radioiodine WBSs are performed.",2011,21449768,no
Cross-protective TH1 immunity against Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans.,"T cell-mediated heterologous immunity to different pathogens is promising for the development of immunotherapeutic strategies. Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans, the 2 most common fungal pathogens causing severe infections in immunocompromised patients, are controlled by CD4+ type 1 helper T (T(H)1) cells in humans and mice, making induction of fungus-specific CD4+ T(H)1 immunity an appealing strategy for antifungal therapy. We identified an immunogenic epitope of the A fumigatus cell wall glucanase Crf1 that can be presented by 3 common major histocompatibility complex class II alleles and that induces memory CD4+ T(H)1 cells with a diverse T-cell receptor repertoire that is cross-reactive to C albicans. In BALB/c mice, the Crf1 protein also elicits cross-protection against lethal infection with C albicans that is mediated by the same epitope as in humans. These data illustrate the existence of T cell-based cross-protection for the 2 distantly related clinically relevant fungal pathogens that may foster the development of immunotherapeutic strategies.",2011,21441461,no
Real-time PCR and quantitative culture for monitoring of experimental Aspergillus fumigatus intracranial infection in neutropenic mice.,"The central nervous system (CNS) is the most common site of dissemination during Aspergillus infection. PCR has the potential to facilitate early diagnosis of CNS aspergillosis, which could assist in reducing disease mortality. In two experiments, neutropenic CD-1 male mice were infected intracranially with 5×10⁶ conidia of Aspergillus fumigatus. At time points up to 120 h after infection, mice were euthanized and samples of blood, brain, spinal cord and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were taken. The brain fungal burden was determined by quantitative culture, and fungal DNA was detected by quantitative PCR. Plating for A. fumigatus from the brain confirmed that all mice had burdens of log₁₀>3 from 4 to 120 h after infection. A. fumigatus DNA was detected in blood (88 %), brain (96 %), CSF (52 %) and spinal cord (92 %) samples. The brain and spinal cord contained the highest concentrations of fungal DNA. Adapting the extraction protocol to maximize yield from small sample volumes (10 µl CSF or 200 µl blood) allowed PCR detection of A. fumigatus in infected mice, suggesting the use of CSF and blood as diagnostic clinical samples for CNS aspergillosis.",2011,21436369,no
[The significance of serum GM and BG antigens assay for invasive fungal infections in hematological malignancies patients].,"To evaluate the diagnostic value of serum galactomannan antigen (GM) and (1→3)-β-D-glucan antigen (BG) assay in invasive fungal infections (IFI) in the patients with hematologic malignancies and the role in monitoring therapeutic response.Fifty one patients with hematological malignancies met the criteria for inclusion: (1) body temperature above 38°C for 48 hours, (2) failure to respond to broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment, or (3) temperature rose again after the responded drop. Blood samples were collected twice at the first week, then once a week in at least four weeks. The double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and colorimetric assay were used for detecting GM and BG. The positive GM test is defined as two consecutive tests at different time GM value > 0.5 or > 0.8 and the positive G test is defined as BG value > 80 pg/ml. The patients were assigned into four groups as proven, probable, possible, and non-fungal infection respectively, and 21 normal volunteers were as controls.Two hundred and forty serum samples were collected from 51 patients including 2 of proven IFI, 26 probable IFI, 17 possible IFI and 6 non-fungal infection. The true-positive group including the proven and probable groups, and true negative group was the non-fungal infection group. GM tests were positive in 21 of 28 cases in true positive group, and only one of 6 cases in non-fungal infection. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 75%, 83.3%, 95.5% and 41.7%, respectively. G tests were positive in all 28 cases of the true positive group, and 4 in 6 non-fungal infection cases. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 100%, 33.3%, 87.5% and 100%, respectively. G test is more sensitive than GM test (P = 0.015), but there was no significant difference in specificity of the two tests (P = 0.242). In 19 of 21 patients with GM test positive, anti-fungal treatment was effective, and GM value gradually decreased to negative, two invalid patients were persistent with GM test positive. After two weeks treatment, the average GM value was significantly lower in the effective group than in the ineffective group (P < 0.05). BG values in the responded patients showed a gradual decline similar to that of GM values, but not to negative. The changes of BG value in ineffective group varied with a trend upward. The changes in BG value had no relation with treatment effectiveness.Serum GM and BG antigens detection provides strong evidence for early diagnosis of IFI. Combination of GM and G tests can improve the diagnostic specificity and reduce the false positive GM test seems superior to G test for monitoring GM and BG values during treatment.",2012,21429401,no
Serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid galactomannan assays in patients with pulmonary aspergilloma.,"The sensitivities of the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan (GM) assays in 48 patients with pulmonary aspergilloma were 38% (13 of 34 95% confidence interval [CI], 22%-56%) and 92% (33 of 36",2011,21427387,no
"Diagnostic methods for fungal infections in pediatric patients: microbiological, serological and molecular methods.","Although invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are relatively rare, they are important causes of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised pediatric patients. Early and precise diagnosis of IFI is important to allow antifungal treatment to be started in time and to reduce the unnecessary use of toxic antifungal agents. Although traditional approaches such as direct microscopic examination, histopathological evaluation and cultivation are still gold standard, the diagnosis of IFI is generally difficult because of inadequate sensitivity and specificity with these tests. Commercial systems detecting the Aspergillus cell wall antigen galactomannan and 1,3-β-D-glucan are seen as the most convenient nonculture methods for the diagnosis of the IFI and monitoring of antifungal treatment. Several molecular methods have been described for the diagnosis of opportunistic mycoses. However, they have not been standardized and have only been used in experimental studies.",2011,21417868,no
Galactomannan-guided preemptive vs. empirical antifungals in the persistently febrile neutropenic patient: a prospective randomized study.,"Patients with neutropenic fever after 4-7 days of broad-spectrum antibiotics are given antifungals empirically. This strategy may lead to over-treatment.Patients with hematological malignancies undergoing intensive chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were randomized to two arms. Patients in the 'preemptive' arm had regular galactomannan (GM) assays, and received caspofungin, amphotericin or voriconazole (CAV) for persistent febrile neutropenia if they had two positive GM results, or a positive GM result and a computed tomography (CT) of the thorax suggestive of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). Patients in the 'empirical' arm received CAV in accordance with established guidelines.Of 27 episodes in the preemptive arm, two cases of IPA were picked up by monitoring. In six episodes, CAV was started despite persistently negative GM readings. One additional patient received CAV for a false-positive GM. Of 25 episodes in the empirical arm, CAV was started empirically in 10, one of whom had CT features of IPA. By intent-to-treat and evaluable-episode analyses, respectively, the preemptive approach saved 11% and 14% of patients from empirical antifungals. Twelve-week survival was 85.2% in the preemptive arm and 84% in the empirical arm.A preemptive approach may reduce empirical antifungal use without compromising survival in persistently febrile neutropenic patients.",2011,21397541,no
Clinical factors associated with a Candida albicans Germ Tube Antibody positive test in Intensive Care Unit patients.,"Poor outcomes of invasive candidiasis (IC) are associated with the difficulty in establishing the microbiological diagnosis at an early stage. New scores and laboratory tests have been developed in order to make an early therapeutic intervention in an attempt to reduce the high mortality associated with invasive fungal infections. Candida albicans IFA IgG has been recently commercialized for germ tube antibody detection (CAGTA). This test provides a rapid and simple diagnosis of IC (84.4% sensitivity and 94.7% specificity). The aim of this study is to identify the patients who could be benefited by the use of CAGTA test in critical care setting.A prospective, cohort, observational multicentre study was carried out in six medical/surgical Intensive care units (ICU) of tertiary-care Spanish hospitals. Candida albicans Germ Tube Antibody test was performed twice a week if predetermined risk factors were present, and serologically demonstrated candidiasis was considered if the testing serum dilution was ≥ 1:160 in at least one sample and no other microbiological evidence of invasive candidiasis was found.Fifty-three critically ill non-neutropenic patients (37.7% post surgery) were included. Twenty-two patients (41.5%) had CAGTA-positive results, none of them with positive blood culture for Candida. Neither corrected colonization index nor antifungal treatment had influence on CAGTA results. This finding could corroborate that the CAGTA may be an important biomarker to distinguish between colonization and infection in these patients. The presence of acute renal failure at the beginning of the study was more frequent in CAGTA-negative patients. Previous surgery was statistically more frequent in CAGTA-positive patients.This study identified previous surgery as the principal clinical factor associated with CAGTA-positive results and emphasises the utility of this promising technique, which was not influenced by high Candida colonization or antifungal treatment. Our results suggest that detection of CAGTA may be important for the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis in surgical patients admitted in ICU.",2011,21388550,no

Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of posaconazole for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis: clinical implications for antifungal therapy.,"Posaconazole is a triazole with anti-Aspergillus activity. However, little is known about the utility of posaconazole as primary therapy for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.An in vitro model of the human alveolus was used to study the impact of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) on exposure-response relationships. The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships of posaconazole were examined in an inhalational murine model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. A mathematical model was fitted to the entire data set. This model was then used to describe the relationship between drug exposure, quantified in terms of the area under the concentration time curve to MIC (AUC:MIC) and the observed antifungal effect.The posaconazole MIC was an important determinant of exposure-response relationships and accounted for a portion of the observed variance. Murine pharmacokinetics were linear for dosages 1-20 mg/kg/day. There was a dose-dependent decline in serum galactomannan concentrations, with near-maximal suppression following 20 mg/kg/day. The murine pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic data were well described by the mathematical model. An AUC:MIC ratio of 167 was associated with half-maximal antifungal effect.These results provide the experimental foundation for the selection of candidate posaconazole regimens for the primary treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in profoundly neutropenic hosts.",2011,21357943,no
Accumulation of recombinant cellobiohydrolase and endoglucanase in the leaves of mature transgenic sugar cane.,"A major strategic goal in making ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass a cost-competitive liquid transport fuel is to reduce the cost of production of cellulolytic enzymes that hydrolyse lignocellulosic substrates to fermentable sugars. Current production systems for these enzymes, namely microbes, are not economic. One way to substantially reduce production costs is to express cellulolytic enzymes in plants at levels that are high enough to hydrolyse lignocellulosic biomass. Sugar cane fibre (bagasse) is the most promising lignocellulosic feedstock for conversion to ethanol in the tropics and subtropics. Cellulolytic enzyme production in sugar cane will have a substantial impact on the economics of lignocellulosic ethanol production from bagasse. We therefore generated transgenic sugar cane accumulating three cellulolytic enzymes, fungal cellobiohydrolase I (CBH I), CBH II and bacterial endoglucanase (EG), in leaves using the maize PepC promoter as an alternative to maize Ubi1 for controlling transgene expression. Different subcellular targeting signals were shown to have a substantial impact on the accumulation of these enzymes the CBHs and EG accumulated to higher levels when fused to a vacuolar-sorting determinant than to an endoplasmic reticulum-retention signal, while EG was produced in the largest amounts when fused to a chloroplast-targeting signal. These results are the first demonstration of the expression and accumulation of recombinant CBH I, CBH II and EG in sugar cane and represent a significant first step towards the optimization of cellulolytic enzyme expression in sugar cane for the economic production of lignocellulosic ethanol.",2011,21356003,no
Purification and characterization of Aspergillus terreus α-galactosidases and their use for hydrolysis of soymilk oligosaccharides.,"α-Galactosidases has the potential to hydrolyze α-1-6 linkages in raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFO). Aspergillus terreus cells cultivated on wheat bran produced three extracellular forms of α-galactosidases (E1, E2, and E3). E1 and E2 α-galactosidases presented maximal activities at pH 5, while E3 α-galactosidase was more active at pH 5.5. The E1 and E2 enzymes showed stability for 6 h at pH 4-7. Maximal activities were determined at 60, 55, and 50 °C, for E1, E2, and E3 α-galactosidase, respectively. E2 α-galactosidase retained 90% of its initial activity after 70 h at 50 °C. The enzymes hydrolyzed ρNPGal, melibiose, raffinose and stachyose, and E1 and E2 enzymes were able to hydrolyze guar gum and locust bean gum substrates. E1 and E3 α-galactosidases were completely inhibited by Hg²⁺, Ag⁺, and Cu²⁺. The treatment of RFO present in soy milk with the enzymes showed that E1 α-galactosidase reduced the stachyose content to zero after 12 h of reaction, while E2 promoted total hydrolysis of raffinose. The complete removal of the oligosaccharides in soy milk could be reached by synergistic action of both enzymes.",2011,21331589,no
Development and evaluation of a latex agglutination test for the serodiagnosis of paracoccidioidomycosis.,"Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is the most prevalent systemic mycosis in Latin America. It is caused by the dimorphic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. The immunodiffusion (ID) test is one of the most widely used techniques for PCM serologic diagnosis due to the simplicity and low costs of its execution. However, it requires trained and qualified people to execute it. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a latex particle agglutination (LA) test for the detection of anti-P. brasiliensis antibodies by using pooled crude exoantigens from the fungus. Fifty-one serum samples obtained from patients with PCM were tested. Positivity was observed in 84% (43/51) of these patients, and the agglutination patterns varied from small clumps with a cloudy background to large clumps with a clear background. The antibody titer reactivity ranged from 1:2 to 1:64. Cross-reactivity was observed in sera from patients with aspergillosis, histoplasmosis, and nonfungal disease. Serum samples obtained from healthy donors were not reactive. The sensitivity and specificity of the LA test were 84% and 81%, respectively. When comparing the LA test with the double-immunodiffusion test, we found an agreement of 92%. Further work is needed to improve the performance of the LA assay before it can be proposed as a reliable diagnostic tool, mainly in laboratories with little infrastructure.",2011,21325485,no
Retigeric acid B exerts antifungal effect through enhanced reactive oxygen species and decreased cAMP.,"Retigeric acid B (RAB), a triterpene acid isolated from Lobaria kurokawae exerts antifungal effect. The present study was designed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which RAB regulates the proliferation and cell death of Candida albicans.We measured the metabolic activity of C. albicans with WST1 Cell Proliferation and Cytotoxicity Assay Kit, analyzed the cell cycle by flow cytometry, visualized the ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and investigated the apoptosis and necrosis induced by RAB using confocal microscopy. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation was determined by spectrophotometry, flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy. The mtΔψ was detected using flow cytometry. And the levels of intracellular cAMP and ATP were measured with cAMP ELISA and ATP Assay Kits, respectively.The proliferation of the yeasts was blocked in G(2)/M phase by a low dose of RAB treatment and in G(1) phase at high concentration. When cultured in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) deprived of energy source, yeasts displayed the phenotype of death caused by accumulated ROS, mtΔψ hyperpolarization and dramatic decrease in ATP level in the presence of high dose of RAB.RAB inhibits the growth of C. albicans by stimulating ROS production and reducing intracellular cAMP. The ROS accumulation, mtΔψ hyperpolarization, ATP depletion and damaged plasma membrane integrity together mediate cell death of C. albicans induced by RAB. Our findings provide a novel molecular mechanism for exploring possible applications of lichen derived metabolites in fighting fungal infection in humans.",2011,21320573,no
Optimization of culture conditions for Aspergillus sojae expressing an Aspergillus fumigatus α-galactosidase.,"Using Response Surface Methodology, carbon and nitrogen sources and agitation speed for cultivation of Aspergillus sojae expressing the α-galactosidase gene, aglB of Aspergillus fumigatus IMI 385708 were optimized.

Antigen detection in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for diagnosis of fungal pneumonia.,"The purpose of this review is to describe important findings published during the past 18 months using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for diagnosis of pulmonary mycoses.Clinical studies and meta-analysis have established a high sensitivity and specificity for Aspergillus galactomannan testing of BAL specimens for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis, superior to that observed with other diagnostic methods. Similar findings have been reported in histoplasmosis and blastomycosis.Fungal antigen testing of BAL specimens is recommended if bronchoscopy is performed for diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates in patient groups at risk for aspergillosis or the endemic mycoses if the diagnosis cannot be established by evaluation of sputum specimens or detection of antigen in the urine or serum.",2011,21311331,no
Topical flagellin-mediated innate defense against Candida albicans keratitis.,"This study was conducted to investigate whether flagellin, the sole ligand of Toll-like receptor-5 (TLR5), induces an innate defense that is sufficient to protect injured corneas from Candida albicans.Scarified corneas of adult B6, TLR5(-/-), Camp(-/-) (cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide), or PMN-depleted mice were pretreated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa flagellin or a mutant and then were inoculated with C. albicans. The corneas were compared for disease progression, cytokine and Camp expression, and PMN infiltration before and after C. albicans infection. Disease progress was recorded by digital photography and clinical scoring, cytokine levels were determined by ELISA, the levels of Camp gene product were assessed by Western blot, and PMN infiltration was measured by MPO determination and immunohistochemistry.Topical application of flagellin induced profound protection against Candida keratitis in a TLR5-dependent manner. The improved disease outcome including reduced tissue inflammation and rapid functional recovery can be attributed to a marked decrease in fungal burden at the early stage of C. albicans infection in flagellin-exposed B6 mouse corneas. Although both PMN infiltration and Camp upregulation contributed to corneal innate defense against fungal infection, Camp ablation totally, and PMN depletion partially, abrogated flagellin-induced fungal clearance in B6 mouse corneas.Flagellin induces a strong innate defense and promotes robust resistance to C. albicans infection in the cornea. Topical flagellin or its mimetic may become a new prophylactic agent for preventing contact lens or trauma/injury-associated microbial keratitis.",2011,21310913,no
Poor compliance with antifungal drug use guidelines by transplant physicians: a framework for educational guidelines and an international consensus on patient safety.,"The rate of compliance with antifungal drug use guidelines by transplant physicians is mostly unknown. We performed a nationwide electronic survey to assess antifungal use by different types of transplant physicians. Sixty-one percent (53/87) of the transplant programs responded (accounting for 85% of heart transplant procedures, 65% of kidney transplantations, and 71.5% of liver transplantations). Antifungal prophylaxis was used in 41.5% programs (liver 93.3%, heart 30.8%, and kidney 16%). Prophylaxis was universal in 32% of the programs and targeted only to selected patients in 68%, mainly indicated after re-transplantation (73.3%), re-intervention (66.7%) and hemodialysis (60%). Main drugs for universal prophylaxis were fluconazole and itraconazole (42.9% each), while fluconazole (60%), L-amphotericin B (AMB), and caspofungin (13.4% each) were preferred for targeted prophylaxis. Overall, 84.9% of the programs used galactomannan for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (only 34% in BAL) and 66.6% used voriconazole as first-line monotherapy. Combination first-line therapy for invasive aspergillosis was used by 31.3%, mainly with voriconazole with caspofungin (40%) or anidulafungin (26.7%) or L-AMB-caspofungin (26.7%). Adherence of transplant physicians to current recommendations on antifungal treatment and prophylaxis is poor. An international consensus that responds to differences in patients and centers and emphasizes patient safety is clearly needed.",2012,21299637,no
Infectious and zoonotic disease testing in pet birds.,"Pet bird ownership and the veterinary diagnostic market for avian and exotic species testing have grown markedly during the past 20 years. Birds present with both unique infectious diseases and other diseases that are known to the human medical community, including aspergillosis, mycobacteriosis, chlamydophilosis, and bornavirus infection, some of which have clear zoonotic implications. Although diagnostic testing for these avian infectious diseases has grown considerably and includes the newer technology of polymerase chain reaction as well as traditional serologic testing, guidelines for the use and interpretation of these tests and standardization of tests among veterinary laboratories remains an unmet challenge.",2011,21295723,no
Design issues in a randomized controlled trial of a pre-emptive versus empiric antifungal strategy for invasive aspergillosis in patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a major cause of mortality in patients with hematological malignancies, due largely to the inability of traditional culture and biopsy methods to make an early or accurate diagnosis. Diagnostic accuracy studies suggest that Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) and Aspergillus PCR-based methods may overcome these limitations, but their impact on patient outcomes should be evaluated in a diagnostic randomized controlled trial (D-RCT). This article describes the methodology of a D-RCT which compares a new pre-emptive strategy (GM-ELISA- and Aspergillus PCR-driven antifungal therapy) with the standard fever-driven empiric antifungal treatment strategy. Issues including primary end-point and patient selection, duration of screening, choice of tests for the pre-emptive strategy, antifungal prophylaxis and bias control, which were considered in the design of the trial, are discussed. We suggest that the template presented herein is considered by researchers when evaluating the utility of new diagnostic tests (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00163722).",2011,21281234,no
Isolation and characterization of recombinant single chain fragment variable anti-idiotypic antibody specific to Aspergillus fumigatus membrane protein.,"Aspergillus fumigatus causes the highly lethal form of invasive aspergillosis (IA). In the present study to develop a novel anti-fungal drug for protection against invasive disease, we identified a single chain fragment variable (scFv) antibody (scFv AF1) by panning against A. fumigatus membrane fraction (AMF) or HM-1 killer toxin (HM-1) neutralizing monoclonal antibody (nmAb-KT) as antigen. The key step was elution of bound phages with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.0 containing AMF. The specificity of soluble scFv AF1 antibody to antigens was verified by ELISA, which specifically binds to both AMF and nmAb-KT. After nucleotide sequencing, clone expression and purification by HisTrap HP affinity column, scFv AF1 showed in vitro anti-fungal activity against A. fumigatus. By SPR analysis it showed high binding affinity to nmAb-KT (K(d)=5.22×10(-11) M). The method used to isolate scFv AF1 was a new method and we believe that it will be applicable to isolate the specific scFv against any kind of membrane protein of yeast or fungus.",2011,21277307,no
Aspergillus fumigatus biofilms in the clinical setting.,"We discuss in this work the role of Aspergillus biofilms in the clinical setting by reviewing the most recent findings on this topic. Aspergillus fumigatus can produce in vitro an extracellular hydrophobic matrix with typical biofilm characteristics under all static conditions tested, i.e., agar media, polystyrene and bronchial epithelial cells. Under static conditions the mycelial growth is greater than in shaken, submerged conditions. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is composed of galactomannan, α-1,3-glucans, monosaccharides and polyols, melanin and proteins including major antigens and hydrophobins. Typical biofilm structures were observed in the aspergillomas from two patients and in a murine model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The results indicate that α-1,3-glucans plays a predominant role in the agglutination of the hyphae together in aerial conditions, and that nutrient starvation was responsible for mycelial death in aspergilloma. Melanin was produced during the infection, suggesting that this pigment is necessary for lung tissue invasion. All antifungal drugs are significantly less effective when A. fumigatus is grown under biofilm vs. planktonic conditions. Chronic persistence of a unique genotype of A. fumigatus in the respiratory tract of CF-patients and the presence of an ECM in vivo may have some therapeutical application for aspergillosis. The most appropriate antifungal drug should not be selected only on the basis of its efficiency to kill in vitro grown fungal cells, but also on its ability to penetrate the ECM.",2012,21254964,no
Recent advances in invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.,"This review highlights the most important and salient recent developments with regards to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), currently the most common opportunistic fungal pneumonia in patients with hematological malignancies.Besides patients in hematology units, other immunosuppressed and critically ill patients are also at risk of IPA. Identification of patients who possess specific polymorphisms of Toll-like receptor 4 and dectin-1, both of which are involved in the immune sensing of Aspergillus spp., may facilitate risk-stratification. The use of the galactomannan assay in bronchoalveolar fluid to improve diagnosis of IPA is undergoing validation. Trending galactomannan and other biomarker results may prognosticate clinical outcomes. During intensive chemotherapy for leukemia, posaconazole and aerosolized liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) have demonstrated efficacy as prophylaxis against invasive fungal infection. However, fluconazole remains an effective prophylactic agent in the setting of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation despite availability of newer antifungal agents. Although voriconazole is still the drug of choice for IPA, both caspofungin and L-AMB are viable alternatives.Despite increasing knowledge of IPA and availability of newer antifungal agents, clinical management remains a challenge in the setting of a compromised host defense system that is unable to mount an appropriate immune response against the pathogen.",2011,21252677,no
Ribosomal and mitochondrial DNA target for real-time PCR diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.,"The aim of the present study was to assess the diagnostic efficacy of a combination of two quantitative Aspergillus PCR assays, targeting a mitochondrial and a ribosomal target, in patients with risk factors for invasive aspergillosis (IA) and positive galactomannan (GM) antigen. Forty-four patients with hematological malignancies and risk factors for IA according to revised European Organization for Research on Treatment of Cancer and the Mycoses Study Group criteria (EORTC/MSG) criteria and presenting at least two sequential GM-positive sera were included in the study. Mitochondrial PCR was carried out prospectively on all GM-positive serum samples. Ribosomal PCR was carried out retrospectively on frozen stored sera. The sensitivities of mitochondrial and ribosomal PCRs were 58% and 50%, respectively. The diagnostic test performance was improved by using a combination of both PCR assays and by considering a patient PCR positive when at least two positive results were obtained. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios were 65%, 94%, and 11.8 and 0.37, respectively. A significant association between fatal outcome at 90 days and positive results of ribosomal PCR assays was observed (adjusted hazard ratio = 8.2 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0 to 65.8",2011,21227993,no
Immune responses induced by heat killed Saccharomyces cerevisiae: a vaccine against fungal infection.,"Heat-killed Saccharomyces cerevisiae (HKY) used as a vaccine protects mice against systemic aspergillosis and coccidioidomycosis. Little is known about the immune response induced by HKY vaccination, consequently our goal was to do an analysis of HKY-induced immune responses involved in protection. BALB/c mice were vaccinated subcutaneously 3 times with HKY, a protective reagent, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, spleen, lymph nodes, and serum collected 2-5 weeks later. Cultured spleen or lymph node cells were stimulated with HKY. Proliferation of HKY-stimulated spleen or lymph node cells was tested by Alamar Blue reduction and flow cytometry. Cytokines from lymphocyte supernatants and antibody to glycans in serum collected from HKY-vaccinated mice were measured by ELISA. The results show that HKY promoted spleen cell and lymph node cell proliferation from HKY-vaccinated mice but not from PBS-vaccinated control mice (all P<0.05). Cytokine measurement showed HKY significantly promoted IFNγ, IL-6 and IL-17A production by spleen cells and lymph node cells (all P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). Cytokine production by HKY-stimulated cells from PBS-vaccinated mice was lower than those from HKY-vaccinated (P<0.05). Cytokines in BAL from HKY-vaccinated were higher, 1.7-fold for IFNγ and 2.1-fold for TNFα, than in BAL from PBS-vaccinated. Flow cytometry of lymphocytes from HKY-vaccinated showed 52% of CD3(+) or 56% of CD8(+) cells exhibited cell division after stimulation with HKY, compared to non-stimulated controls (26 or 23%, respectively) or HKY-stimulated cells from PBS-vaccinated (31 or 34%). HKY also induced antibody against Saccharomyces glucan and mannan with titers 4- or 2-fold, respectively, above that in unvaccinated. Taken together, the results suggested that HKY vaccination induces significant and specific Th1 type cellular immune responses and antibodies to glucan and mannan.",2011,21219976,no
Formal adult infectious disease specialist consultations in the outpatient setting at a comprehensive cancer center (1998-2008): diverse and impactful.,"The literature on the impact of infectious disease (ID) consulations in the outpatient treatment of cancer is scarce.The medical records of consecutive adult patients with cancer formally evaluated by two board-certified ID specialists in an outpatient setting at our institution over a 10-year period (1998-2008) were reviewed retrospectively. The patients' demographics, referring departments, purposes for consultation, ID specialist recommendations, and overall impact of consultations on outcome were analyzed.We identified 598 patients who underwent ID specialist consultations. Most of them had solid tumors (53%), predominantly breast cancer, whereas non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was the most common hematologic malignancy. Almost half of the patients (45%) had active malignancies, but few of them were severely neutropenic (8%) or had been receiving high doses of corticosteroids (17%). The most frequent requests for consultation were culture or serologic test (15%), and treatment of cellulitis and/or surgical wound infections (14%). Of 337 isolated pathogens, the most prevalent were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (13%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), as well as atypical mycobacteria (16%) and Aspergillus species (11%). ID specialists provided alternative diagnoses in 53% of the cases, including identification of a different infection (46%), a noninfectious etiology (29%), colonization (16%), and drug-related toxic effects (9%). Overall, we deemed the contribution of the ID specialist to be significant in 62% of the consultations.ID specialists contribute significantly to the outpatient care of individuals with cancer.",2012,21191800,no
Pathogen-specific DNA enrichment does not increase sensitivity of PCR for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in neutropenic patients.,"PCR assays designed for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in high-risk patients have to detect minute amounts of target DNA to reach sufficient analytical sensitivity to be of clinical use. This prospective study assessed the use of a novel strategy for selective pathogen DNA enrichment for enhancing the performance of diagnostic PCR in a direct comparison with a highly sensitive in-house quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay and the galactomannan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Surprisingly, and in contrast to experience with other patient groups, the novel protocol for selective pathogen DNA enrichment did not enhance but instead significantly impaired sensitivity. This could be explained by the small amounts of host DNA in the specimens, which were derived mostly from severely neutropenic patients. In the qPCR assay, positive samples required an average of 43.5 amplification cycles (range, 39.2 to 50) for detection in the in-house PCR. Repetitive testing of selected samples showed test positivity to be variable, most likely due to the small amounts of target DNA. Despite this, the in-house protocol proved helpful in the diagnosis of IA, detecting 2 out of 3 patients with probable IA and 10 out of 19 patients with possible IA. Our results underline the necessity for diagnostic PCR protocols that help diagnose IA to be highly sensitive and show that selective pathogen DNA enrichment using affinity purification may not be useful in severely neutropenic patients.",2011,21191054,no
An alternate method of classifying allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis based on high-attenuation mucus.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is classified radiologically based on the findings of central bronchiectasis (CB) and other radiologic features (ORF). However, the long-term clinical significance of these classifications remains unknown. We hypothesized that the immunological activity and outcomes of ABPA could be predicted on HRCT chest finding of high-attenuation mucus (HAM), a marker of inflammatory activity. In this study, we evaluate the severity and clinical outcomes of ABPA with different radiological classifications.PATIENTS WERE CLASSIFIED BASED ON CT CHEST FINDINGS AS: (a) serologic ABPA (ABPA-S) and ABPA-CB (b) ABPA-S, ABPA-CB, and ABPA-CB-ORFOf the 234 (123 males, 111 females mean age, 34.1 years) patients, 55 (23.5%) had normal HRCT, 179 (76.5%) had CB, 49 (20.9%) had HAM, and 27 (11.5%) had ORF. All immunological markers were consistently higher in the HAM classification, while in other classifications these findings were inconsistent. On multivariate analysis, the factors predicting frequent relapses were presence of HAM (OR 7.38The classification scheme based on HAM most consistently predicts immunological severity in ABPA. Central bronchiectasis and HAM are independent predictors of recurrent relapses in ABPA. Hence, HAM should be employed in the radiological classification of ABPA.",2011,21179536,no
[A systematic review of the accuracy of diagnostic test of serum galactomannan antigen detection for invasive aspergillosis].,"To assess the value of galactomannan (GM) double-direct sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA).A search in MEDLINE, EMbase, OVID, CBMdisc and CHKD from Jan. 1991 to Dec. 2008 was conducted to collect all articles about diagnostic tests of serum GM detection. Then the methodological quality was assessed by QUADAS-items, sources of heterogeneity investigated, pooled effect quantities evaluated, and meta-analysis studies, SROC curves, and subgroup analysis performed.Thirty-six articles with a population of 4959 patients were included. The average prevalence of IA was 10%(532/4959). Our meta-analysis reported a median heterogeneity (I(2) = 48.6%, P < 0.05), with a pooled DOR value of 19.10 (95%CI 12.67 - 28.79), a pooled sensitivity of 0.66 (95%CI 0.61 - 0.70), a pooled specificity of 0.90 (95%CI 0.89 - 0.90), a pooled positive likelihood ratio of 5.48 (95%CI 4.27 - 7.02), a pooled negative likelihood ratio of 0.38 (95%CI 0.29 - 0.50), and an area under curve of SROC 0.88. The rate of underdiagnosis of serum GM detection was 34% (168/490) and the rate of misdiagnosis was 10% (466/4469). With a rise in the cut-off value the sensitivity of GM test decreased and specificity increased. Two consecutive positive tests decreased the sensitivity but increased the specificity. Age had no significant effect on the diagnosis by GM test. Both antifungal prophylaxis and antifungal therapy had no significant effect on sensitivity and specificity of GM test for IA diagnosis.Serum GM detection is an effective diagnostic tool for invasive aspergillosis in high-risk populations.",2011,21176508,no
Factors influencing the performance level of Candida mannan antigen testing in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients not receiving fluconazole prophylaxis.,"In this study, we evaluated the value of the Platelia(®) Candida mannan antigen (Ag) sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test in the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis (IC) and the degree of oral colonization by Candida species in 102 allogeneic stem cell transplantation recipients who were not receiving fluconazole prophylaxis. Of the 2071 serum samples, 98 (4.7%) yielded positive and 78 (3.8%) borderline results with a cut-off value of 0.5 ng/mL. One patient had IC. In this patient, 6 out of 9 serum samples were positive, the first one 49 days before Candida albicans candidemia. False-positive results occurred in 92 (4.4%) samples and in 54 (52.9%) patients. Use of valacyclovir and acyclovir was associated with false-positive or borderline results. The median Ag concentration of the true-positive results was significantly higher than the concentration of the false-positive results (1.60 versus 0.62 ng/mL, P<0.001). With higher cut-off values of 0.75 and 1.0 ng/mL, false-positive Ag test results were seen in 17 and 7 patients, respectively. Of the 657 oral samples, a total of 92 (14%) samples in 39 (38.2%) patients turned out to be positive. C. albicans grew in 82 samples (89.1%), other Candida species in 9 (9.8%), and Aspergillus fumigatus in 1 sample (1.1%). In conclusion, despite the lack of fluconazole prophylaxis, the incidence of IC was low (1%). False-positive Ag test results were common with a test cut-off value of 0.5 ng/mL, and a single positive result does not seem to predict IC. Multiple positive results might predict IC, as 6 out of 9 samples were positive in the only patient with IC, the first one 7 weeks before positive blood cultures.",2011,21176021,no
In vitro activity and in vivo efficacy of anidulafungin in murine infections by Aspergillus flavus.,Anidulafungin (AFG) showed high activity against 27 strains of Aspergillus flavus by use of broth microdilution and disk diffusion methods. This drug was effective in vivo in a murine model of disseminated infection with five isolates tested. AFG was able to prolong survival and reduce tissue burden of infected mice but not able to reduce galactomannan serum concentrations. The AFG serum levels were above the corresponding minimum effective concentrations (MEC) for all of the strains tested.,2011,21149624,no
Clinical profile of pulmonary aspergilloma complicating residual tubercular cavitations in Northen Indian patients.,"Little is known regarding the clinical profile of Aspergilloma in Indian patients. Such a study was undertaken at Hospital for Chest and TB, Jaipur.Old, treated patients of pulmonary tuberculosis showing ball like lesion/s inside cavity/ies or a recent thickening of cavity wall were enrolled. Morning sputa samples were collected in the patients who were able to raise sputum and were examined by KOH mount and fungal culture. Serum anti-aspergillus antibodies were estimated in all the patients. Twenty normal healthy subjects were included to serve as control. All patients showing a positive or borderline positive serology were diagnosed as pulmonary aspergilloma (PA group). The remaining patients formed the non-aspergilloma group (Non PA group).A total of 98 study patients could be classified as PA group (54 patients by serology alone, 44 patients by serology as well as sputum culture). The remaining 152 patients were classified as non PA group. Hemoptysis alone or along with other chest symptoms was significantly more common in PA group as compared to non PA group patients (P<0.001), more so in those with ball like lesions. But chest symptoms other than hemoptysis were more common in non PA group. Within the PA group, 21 (13 with ball like lesions and 8 with thickening of cavity wall) had clinical symptoms suggestive of CNPA and two patients (one each with ball like lesions and thickening of cavity wall) had clinical symptoms suggestive of ABPA.The clinical profile of pulmonary Aspergilloma in Indian patients is very protean ranging from saprophytic disease to CNPA and less commonly to ABPA.",2010,21139716,no
Synthetic biotinylated tetra β(1→5) galactofuranoside for in vitro aspergillosis diagnosis.,The synthesis of a tetra β(1→5) galactofuranoside was achieved using a thioglycoside donor with a methyl tert-butyl phenyl thio leaving group. This tetrasaccharide was conjugated to biotin and validated as antigen with the monoclonal antibody used for clinical detection of Aspergillus fumigatus galactomannan on streptavidin-coated microplates. Then we have shown its ability to detect antibodies associated with A. fumigatus induced disease by using sera from patients with Allergic broncho-pulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and correlated the results of antibody detection with those gained with a commercially available diagnostic test.,2011,21129984,no
[Early antigen diagnosis of invasive fungal infection in patients with hematological malignancies and patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation].,"This study was purposed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of G/(1, 3-β-D glucan)/GM (galactomannan) combined detection for early diagnosis of invasive fungal disease (IFD), determine the GM positive cut-off value, and investigate the change of diagnostic level before and after G/GM test and the relation of GM value with therapeutic effect. The ELISA with double antibody sandwich was used to detect the serum levels of G and G/M. The results showed that according to determined GM positive cut-off value, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of G/GM combined detection were 100%, 65.7%, 67.6% and 100%, respectively. The case number of the clinical diagnosis of IFD increased from 1 to 24 cases, the diagnosis of 12 non-infective patients was changed as suspected IFD with the help of G/GM combined detection the GM cut-off value decreased in patients whose GM cut-off value was higher before therapy and antifungal therapy was effective, while the GM cut-off value increased in patients no-responded to therapy. It is concluded that G/GM combined detection can increased the sensitivity of the diagnosis and reduce false negative rate in the early diagnosis of IFD. The dynamically monitoring G/GM cut-off value can be used as evaluation indicator of therapeutic efficacy.",2011,21129281,yes
HapX positively and negatively regulates the transcriptional response to iron deprivation in Cryptococcus neoformans.,"The fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans is a major cause of illness in immunocompromised individuals such as AIDS patients. The ability of the fungus to acquire nutrients during proliferation in host tissue and the ability to elaborate a polysaccharide capsule are critical determinants of disease outcome. We previously showed that the GATA factor, Cir1, is a major regulator both of the iron uptake functions needed for growth in host tissue and the key virulence factors such as capsule, melanin and growth at 37°C. We are interested in further defining the mechanisms of iron acquisition from inorganic and host-derived iron sources with the goal of understanding the nutritional adaptation of C. neoformans to the host environment. In this study, we investigated the roles of the HAP3 and HAPX genes in iron utilization and virulence. As in other fungi, the C. neoformans Hap proteins negatively influence the expression of genes encoding respiratory and TCA cycle functions under low-iron conditions. However, we also found that HapX plays both positive and negative roles in the regulation of gene expression, including a positive regulatory role in siderophore transporter expression. In addition, HapX also positively regulated the expression of the CIR1 transcript. This situation is in contrast to the negative regulation by HapX of genes encoding GATA iron regulatory factors in Aspergillus nidulans and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Although both hapX and hap3 mutants were defective in heme utilization in culture, only HapX made a contribution to virulence, and loss of HapX in a strain lacking the high-affinity iron uptake system did not cause further attenuation of disease. Therefore, HapX appears to have a minimal role during infection of mammalian hosts and instead may be an important regulator of environmental iron uptake functions. Overall, these results indicated that C. neoformans employs multiple strategies for iron acquisition during infection.",2011,21124817,no
Candida parapsilosis-specific monoclonal antibodies and their use for detection of Candida antigens in experimental systemic candidiasis.,"Candida parapsilosis has emerged as one of the most common causes of bloodstream infection worldwide. The diagnosis of invasive candidiasis etiological agents to the species level remains a laboratory and clinical challenge. Thus, specific monoclonal antibodies to detect systemic candidiasis and to identify Candida virulence factors and associated pathogenesis through immunohistochemistry would be very useful. Inbred Balb/c mice were immunized with C. parapsilosis antigens, and blood was checked for the presence of reactive antibodies using ELISA. Fusion was performed using the harvested spleen cells and NS1 myeloma cells, and the clones were screened for the presence of antibody producing hybrid cells by dot-blot. The 1B11 clone secreted IgG2a monoclonal antibody that was reactive with the C. parapsilosis antigen at MW of 59 kDa and cross-reacted with C. tropicalis but not with other fungal and bacterial antigens tested. Another 3D1 clone secreted IgG1 monoclonal antibody that was reactive with C. parapsilosis antigen at MW of 30 kDa. The 3D1 monoclonal antibody was found to be species specific. Experimental systemic candidiasis in rats was induced through intravenous injection of C. parapsilosis, and all the vital organs were collected for immunohistochemistry study. These monoclonal antibodies were reactive against surface epitopes on the yeast cells, pseudohyphae, and immune complexes in tissue sections. Sandwich ELISAs using these antibodies were developed and were able to detect circulating antigens in experimental candidiasis in rats at 0.2 μg/μL. These monoclonal antibodies may have potential as primary capture antibodies for the development of rapid diagnostic test for human systemic fungal infection.",2011,21117988,no
In vitro activity and in vivo efficacy of posaconazole in treatment of murine infections by different isolates of the Aspergillus terreus complex.,"Posaconazole (PSC) is an antifungal drug recommended as an alternative for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis in patients who are refractory or intolerant to primary antifungal therapy. We have evaluated the in vitro activity of PSC against 21 strains of the Aspergillus terreus complex using both broth microdilution and disk diffusion (Neo Sensitabs) methods. PSC showed the same high level of activity against all the strains with the two in vitro methods used. We developed a murine model of disseminated infection to evaluate the efficacy of PSC at 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg of body weight twice a day by using 6 different strains chosen randomly. PSC showed good efficacy, especially at 20 mg/kg, as measured by prolonged survival, tissue burden reduction, histopathology, and lowered galactomannan levels. The PSC levels in serum on the fourth day of treatment were higher than the MICs for the strains tested.",2011,21115792,no
Modified magnetic nanoparticles in an electrochemical method for the ochratoxin A determination in Vitis vinifera red grapes tissues.,"This work described the development and characterization of an electrochemical method using square wave voltammetry (SWV) combined with the use of modified magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), which had shown a rapid and sensitive determination of ochratoxin A (OTA) in wine grapes (Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Syrah) post-harvest tissues. The wine grapes were inoculated with Aspergillus ochraceus to obtain OTA in artificially infected samples. The OTA was directly determined using square-wave voltammetry. The current obtained is directly proportional to the concentration of OTA present in the samples. This method has been used for OTA determination in wine grapes and it was validated against a commercial ELISA test kit. The limits of detection calculated for electrochemical detection and the ELISA were 0.02 and 1.9 μg kg(-1), respectively and the coefficients of variation for accuracy and precision dates were below 5.5%. This method promises to be suitable for the detection and quantification of OTA in apparently healthy fruits post-harvest for assuring safety and quality of food as well as consumer's health.",2011,21111187,no
Invasive aspergillosis in patients with liver disease.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) has been traditionally considered an infection occurring in patients with well established risk factors, such as neutropenia, hematologic malignancies, organ transplantation, or HIV. However there is increasing evidence that apparently immunocompetent patients, such as those with severe liver disease, are also at high risk for Aspergillus infections. Here we report two cases of proven invasive aspergillosis and review 72 others of aspergillosis reported since 1973 in patients with liver disease. Most patients had end-stage cirrhosis or acute hepatic failure. Overall mortality rate was 72.2% and the majority of patients who died had CNS involvement, disseminated infections, and received antifungal agents on a less common basis. A trend toward higher survival for cases reported during the period 2000-2009 was observed. Literature data suggest that invasive aspergillosis is a potential fatal complication of severe liver disease. The high mortality rate observed in these patients appears to be related not only to the severity of their underlying conditions, but also to a lack in clinical diagnosis. New diagnostic tools, e.g., galactomannan (GM) antigen test, in association with increased clinical suspicion may allow an early diagnosis and improve the outcome of IA in this particular category of patients.",2011,21108575,no
Comparison of PCR-ELISA and Real-Time PCR for invasive aspergillosis diagnosis in patients with hematological malignancies.,"This study aimed at comparing a real-time PCR assay and a PCR-ELISA assay of both serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in patients with hematological malignancies. Using a nested case-control design, 163 patients at risk were prospectively monitored and PCR assays were performed on frozen aliquots of 459 sera which were prospectively sampled twice weekly and 42 BAL specimens sampled from 43 probable and one proven IA cases and 47 matched controls. The data from three patients classified as possible IA were excluded from the nested case-control study. The sensitivity of real-time PCR and PCR-ELISA assays in serum was 73% and 86%, respectively and specificity was 100% for both. In BAL, sensitivity was 64% for real-time PCR, 71% for PCR-ELISA and 86% for Galactomannan antigen (GMA) assays with specificities of 96%, 96%, and 93%, respectively. While slightly less sensitive, the real time-PCR assay was highly specific and considerably faster and more workable than PCR-ELISA. Combining real-time PCR and GMA detection for both serum and BAL samples enhances routine laboratory IA diagnosis.",2011,21108574,no
Calcineurin-dependent galactomannan release in Aspergillus fumigatus.,"The galactomannan assay to diagnose invasive aspergillosis is recommended and clinically utilized, yet the mechanism of galactomannan release from Aspergillus fumigatus is unknown. We used an A. fumigatus strain lacking calcineurin A (cnaA), already shown to be critically important for pathogenicity, to evaluate galactomannan kinetics. During the logarithmic growth phase when glucose was consumed, β-D-galactofuranoside (galf)-antigens were released in the culture. However, after glucose became limited, GM release further increased in the supernatants of the wild type strain while there was no further increase of GM release in the ΔcnaA strain. β-Galactofuranosidase activity was also decreased in the ΔcnaA mutant, and the amount of galf-antigen in the cell wall fraction of the ΔcnaA mutant was approximately ten-fold higher. This suggests the possibility that the antigen is unable to be released due to a cell wall abnormality. This and previous work suggest a dynamic calcineurin-dependent cell wall during periods of growth, with galactomannan release from the cell wall possibly calcineurin-dependent and reflected in the decreased GM release and greatly increased cell wall fraction of galf in the ΔcnaA mutant.",2011,21107627,no
Fungal infections in ICU patients: epidemiology and the role of diagnostics.,"Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are on the increase not only among oncology and transplant patients but also among patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU). The rise in ICU IFIs can be attributed to the growing use of complex surgical procedures, invasive medical devices, and long-term, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. The majority of these life-threatening infections are caused by the well-known opportunistic pathogens Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus, but new opportunistic pathogens, including yeast-like and other filamentous fungi, have emerged as additional causes. Invasive Candida infections, particularly candidemia, represent the most common IFI in critically ill patients. The species that cause candidemia markedly differ in their responses to antifungal drugs for this reason, therapy must be tailored to the susceptibility characteristics of the infectious agent. Candidemia caused by non-albicans Candida species is increasing worldwide, and these infections are generally associated with high mortality rates, particularly bloodstream infections caused by C. krusei, which is innately resistant to fluconazole, or C. glabrata, which easily develops azole resistance. Although invasive yeast infections can be considered the most important causes of morbidity and mortality in ICU patients, pulmonary aspergillosis has recently emerged as an additional complication. Diagnosis of IFIs can be achieved using conventional approaches (microscopy, culture, and serology) and newer methods, including antigen detection and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Because most of the conventional approaches lack sensitivity, antigen detection and PCR assays could represent a valid alternative",2011,21102391,no
"Cat-scratch uveitis confirmed by histological, serological, and molecular diagnoses.","To report a case of a cat-scratch uveitis caused by Bartonella henselae, which was confirmed by histology, serology, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodology.An iris nodule was biopsied from a 4-year-old child who was scratched by a kitten on the side of his face and developed redness of the eye associated with cervical lymphadenopathy. Sections of the iridectomy specimen were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, and Warthin-Starry technique for histopathologic evaluation. Additionally, serologic tests and molecular diagnosis using B. henselae-specific PCR were performed.Histopathologically, sections of the iridectomy specimen showed a zonal granulomatous inflammation with a central iris necrotic abscess surrounded by a mantle of epithelioid histiocytes and more peripherally by lymphocytes and plasma cells. The Warthin-Starry stain disclosed scattered short bacilli within the necrotic abscess morphologically compatible with B. henselae. Report of serologic tests for B. henselae disclosed a negative immunoglobulin G antibody (negative: less than 12) and a positive immunoglobulin M antibody of 18 (positive: greater than 15). Other serologic studies including Toxocara, histoplasmin, blastomycin, coccidioidin, aspergillin, and Chlamydia were all negative. PCR was positive for B. henselae DNA.Our case showed a unilateral chronic granulomatous iritis with the histopathologic features compatible with CSD caused by B. henselae bacillus as demonstrated in the iris biopsy and confirmed by serology and PCR technique. This case is an example of a relatively rare uveal manifestation of CSD.",2011,21099401,no
[Multiple serum antigenic assays for diagnosis of invasive fungal infections in non-neutropenic adult patients].,"To evaluate the value of plasma 1, 3-β-D-glucan (G), serum mannan, galactomannan (GM) and cryptococcus capsular antigen assays for diagnosis of invasive fungal infections (IFI) in non-neutropenic adult patients.This was a prospective case control study. Plasma and serum samples from 25 patients with IFI (candidiasis, aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, zygomycosis, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia), 27 patients with bacterial infections, and 25 healthy adults were collected from February 2007 to February 2009 in Beijing Hospital. The serum antigenic assays were performed and their sensitivity and specificity were analyzed. Optimal cut-off level of G test and mannan was established with receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC).The concentration of G test in plasma of patients with IFI [89.4 (25.8, 336.9) ng/L] was significantly higher than that of patients with bacterial infection [8.1 (5.0, 34.9) ng/L, U = 120.5, P < 0.001] and healthy adults [3.8 (3.8, 26.0) ng/L, U = 76.5, P < 0.001]. The area under curve (AUC) was 0.858, and the optimal cut-off value was 71.7 ng/L. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 65.0% (13/20), 92.3% (48/52), 76.5% (13/17) and 87.2% (48/55) respectively. The concentration of mannan in serum from patients with candidiasis [1.13 (0.44, 1.22) µg/L] was significantly higher than that from patients with non-candidiasis IFI [0.21 (0.14, 0.27) µg/L, U = 19, P < 0.05], bacterial infection [0.26 (0.22, 0.32) µg/L, U = 36.5, P < 0.001] and healthy adults [0.25 (0.22, 0.30) µg/L, U = 29.5, P < 0.001].

[Expression of inflammatory cytokines in a mouse model of keratomycosis].,"To investigate the expression, contribution and regulation of predominant inflammatory cytokines in the inflammation process of in a mouse model of keratomycosis.It was an experimental study. Two hundred forty inbred BALB/c mice were randomly divided into four groups (injury control group, F. solani infected group, A. fumigatus infected group and C. albicans infected group) and establishment fungal keratitis was performed. At 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after infection, the photographs of their corneas were taken using the slit lamp and the digital camera system. The presence of inflammatory cells and fungal hyphae were observed by HE and PAS staining. Four inflammatory cytokines in infectious corneas, including MIP-2, KC, IL-1β, and IL-6, were detected respectively for expression of mRNA and protein levels, using RT-PCR and ELISA. One-way ANOVA was used to test the comparisons of the clinical scoring, RT-PCR, and ELISA, and LSD was used to test multiple comparisons.The course and inflammatory reaction of corneal tissue in all infected group increased at day 3 and 5 and gradually decreased after day 7 with time. The RT-PCR results showed, the mRNA expression levels of MIP-2 and IL-1β were the highest in A. fumigatus infected group, and the expression levels of KC was the highest in C. albicans infected group. Additionally, the expression levels of IL-6 were found to be the highest in F. solani infected group. The mRNA expression levels of IL-1β and KC in each experimental group were higher than those of IL-6 and MIP-2. The peak expression levels of MIP-2, KC, and IL-1β occurred at day 5, day 1, and day 3 in F. solani infected group, A. fumigatus infected group and C. albicans infected group, respectively. However, the peak expression level of IL-6 occurred at day 1 and 7, day 1 and 7, and day 1 and 5 in the F. solani, A. fumigatus, and C. albicans groups, respectively. The difference of mRNA expression of each cytokine had statistically significant between each groups (MIP-2: F = 1675.339, P < 0.01 KC: F = 730.267, P < 0.01The expression levels of MIP-2, KC and IL-1β are closely related to the performance of the disease severity and inflammatory reaction of FK.

[Immunoadsorption in highly sensitized renal transplant recipients].,"to investigate the efficacy and safety of protein A immunoadsorption (IA) therapy in the prevention of highly sensitized renal transplant recipients with acute rejection.a retrospective analysis of preoperative clinical data was carried out in 12 renal transplant patients in our hospital from March 2008 to October 2009 with a high level of panel reactive antibody (PRA). Serum PRA and IgG, IgM, IgA were detected at pre and post-treatment. The acute rejection responses and adverse effects were observed.at post-treatment, PRA of both Class I and II antibody [14% (4%, 27%) vs 86% (73%, 98%), 6% (0, 23%) vs 68% (34%, 88%), P < 0.01] and serum total IgG levels significantly decreased [(550 ± 341) g/L vs (1301 ± 393) g/L, P < 0.01]. IgA and IgM were also lower than those at pre-treatment [(144 ± 78) g/L vs (185 ± 93) g/L, (103 ± 48) g/L vs (131 ± 66) g/L, P < 0.01]. Five cases had acute rejection reversible by anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) or combined IA (n = 2). Within 6 months, 1 cases developed Aspergillus pneumonia, 2 cases of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia were cured.IA therapy can reduce antibody levels in highly sensitized renal transplant recipients.

"IgE, IgGa, IgGb and IgG(T) serum antibody levels in offspring of two sires affected with equine recurrent airway obstruction.","Equine recurrent airway obstruction (RAO) is a chronic lower airway disease of the horse caused by hypersensitivity reactions to inhaled stable dust, including mould spores such as Aspergillus fumigatus. The goals of this study were to investigate whether total serum IgE levels and allergen-specific IgE and IgG subclasses are influenced by genetic factors and/or RAO and whether quantitative trait loci (QTL) could be identified for these parameters. The offspring of two RAO-affected sires (S1: n=56 and S2: n=65) were grouped by stallion and disease status, and total serum IgE levels and specific IgE, IgGa, IgGb and IgG(T) levels against recombinant Aspergillus fumigatus 7 (rAspf7) were measured by ELISA. A panel of 315 microsatellite markers covering the 31 equine autosomes were used to genotype the stallions and their offspring. A whole-genome scan using half-sib regression interval mapping was performed for each of the IgG and IgE subclasses. There was no significant effect of disease status or sire on total IgE levels, but there was a significant effect of gender and age. rAspf7-specific IgGa levels were significantly higher in RAO-affected than in healthy horses. The offspring of S1 had significantly higher rAspf7-specific IgGa and IgE levels than those of S2. Five QTLs were significant chromosome-wide (P<0.01). QTLs for rAspf7-specific IgGa and IgE were identified on ECA 1, for rAspf7-specific IgGa and IgGb on ECA 24 and for rAspf7 IgGa on ECA 26. These results provide evidence for effects of disease status and genetics on allergen-specific IgGa and IgE.",2015,21070286,no
Galactomannan testing in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid facilitates the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with hematologic malignancies and stem cell transplant recipients.,"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a major cause of mortality in patients with stem cell transplants and hematologic malignancies. Timely diagnosis of IPA improves survival but is difficult to make. We evaluated the effectiveness of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) galactomannan (GM) in diagnosing IPA in these populations by retrospectively reviewing records of 67 consecutive patients, in whom 89 BAL GM tests were performed. For patients with IPA, only the first BAL sample linked to the IPA episode was analyzed. Eighty samples were associated with proven, 12 with probable, and 32 with possible invasive fungal infections (IFI), and 37 were associated with no IFI. Among patients with IFIs, 4 had proven, 11 probable, and 32 possible IPA. Using BAL GM ≥ 0.5 (cutoff for serum GM) and ≥ 0.85 (optimal cutoff identified by receiver-operating characteristic curve), the sensitivity in diagnosing proven or probable IPA was 73% (11/15) and 67% (10/15), respectively, and specificity was 89% (33/37) and 95% (35/37). At these cutoffs, positive and negative predictive values were 73% (11/15) and 83% (10/12), and 89% (33/37) and 87% (35/40), respectively. BAL GM was more sensitive than cytology (0%, 0/14), BAL culture (27%, 4/15), transbronchial biopsy (40%, 2/5), or serum GM (67%, 10/15) for diagnosing IPA. BAL GM was ≥ 0.85 and ≥ 0.5 in 86% (6/7) and 100% (7/7) of patients with proven or probable IPA who received a mold-active agent for ≤ 3 days. BAL GM added sensitivity to serum GM and other means of diagnosing IPA, and was not impacted by short courses of mold-active agents.",2011,21087680,no
Enzyme-mediated site-specific antibody-protein modification using a ZZ domain as a linker.,"A ZZ domain (ZZ) and alkaline phosphatase (AP), luciferase (Luc), or glucose oxidase (GOD) were conjugated using Sortase A (SrtA) from Staphylococcus aureus. The specific peptidyl linker for SrtA was genetically fused to the C-terminus of ZZ, and the other linker was fused to the N-terminus of AP, Luc, or GOD, respectively. The resultant proteins were obtained separately by bacterial expression. The recombinant peptide-tagged ZZ and AP, Luc, or GOD were site-specifically conjugated by SrtA through the extra peptidyl linkers in vitro. The SrtA reaction had little influence on either the antibody-binding activity of the ZZ moiety or the enzymatic activity of AP, Luc, or GOD moieties of the conjugates. Additionally, antibody-ZZ-proteins were yielded easily by mixing antibody with ZZ-AP, ZZ-Luc, or ZZ-GOD, allowing their use in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These results suggest that the enzymatic approach with SrtA facilitates the construction of ZZ-proteins. Furthermore, mixing antibody and ZZ-proteins produces a wide variety of antibody-ZZ-proteins.",2011,21069999,no
[Comparison of glucan and galactomannan tests with real-time PCR for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in a neutropenic rat model].,"The incidence of aspergillosis which has high mortality rates, has increased gradually. Since invasive aspergillosis (IA) is one of the leading causes of death in immunocompromized and neutropenic patients, early and accurate diagnosis of IA is of crucial importance. The aims of this study were to compare the results of culture, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RtPCR), galactomannan (GM) antigen and glucan (GC) antigen detection tests and to evaluate their performances in view of rapid and accurate diagnosis of IA in neutropenic rat model. Female Wistar albino rats were included in the study with the consent of Animal Searching Ethical Committee and classified into three groups as healthy controls (n= 6), neutropenic controls (n= 10) and pulmonary aspergillosis (n= 35) groups. Rats were immunosuppressed with 5-flourourasil and then Aspergillus fumigatus conidia were inoculated intranasally. On the seventh day of the infection, blood, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung tissue samples were collected from the animals, and control and aspergillosis groups were compared in terms of infection markers. All of the tests (culture, RtPCR, GM and BG tests) were found to be negative in controls. At the end of the study 22 rats in aspergillosis group survived. Lung tissue samples from those 22 animals were all positive for the presence of hypha on pathological preparations, while 20 (91%) yielded Aspergillus colonies on the cultures. Aspergillus DNA was detected in 7 of the 12 BAL samples (58.3%), 7 of 19 blood samples (36.8%) and 4 of 22 lung tissue samples (18%) using RtPCR method. GM antigen was detected in 7 of 20 serum samples (35%) with a commercial kit (Platelia® Aspergillus ELISA, BioRad, France). Quantitative detection of betalucan levels were investigated by using a commercial kit (Fungitell™, Cape Cod, USA) in serum and BAL samples and positive results were obtained in 11 of 22 serum (50%) and 9 of 17 BAL (52.9%) samples. In this study it was demonstrated that PCR performed in BAL samples is the most sensitive method compared to the others, for the diagnosis of IA in the rat model. The sensitivity rates were as follows when culture method accepted as the gold standard: 58.3% for BAL-PCR, 41.2% for blood-PCR, 20% for tissue-PCR, 38.9% for serum GM, 55% for serum GC and 52.9% for BAL-GC. It was also concluded that detection of GC activity in serum was more sensitive than GM detection in serum (sensitivity of GM was %38.9, sensitivity of GC was %55, while specificities were 100% for both of the tests), for laboratory diagnosis of IA. The BAL samples were evaluated as the most valuable clinical samples to screen the suspected patients. However, even in proven cases, 41.7% of BAL samples were found negative with PCR, 50% of serum samples were found negative with GC test, and 65% of serum samples were found negative with GM test. Since the pathogenesis of IA has not been completely clarified, the performance of non-culture based diagnostic tests exhibit great variability. Future clinical studies are required to compare the performance of different nonculture based diagnostic methods and the optimal combination of these tests for the most accurate laboratory diagnosis of IA.",2012,21063994,no
Positive results of serum galactomannan assays and pulmonary computed tomography predict the higher response rate of empirical antifungal therapy in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,"Invasive fungal disease (IFD) is a leading cause of infection-related mortality among patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Although the mortality of IFD has been decreased with empirical antifungal therapy in this population, overtreatment remains a problem, for the persistent or recurrent fever is nonspecific for an IFD. Hence, we explored retrospectively the value of incorporating serum galactomannan (GM) test and pulmonary high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) as predictors for higher response rate of empirical treatment. In our study, all of 124 patients after allo-HSCT received empirical antifungal therapy when the persistent or recurrent fever developed after receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. Meanwhile, the levels of serum GM were monitored twice weekly and pulmonary HRCT was performed serially. It showed that the response rate of empirical antifungal therapy was higher in patients with positive results of serum GM tests and/or chest CT scan than that in all patients (66.1% versus 44.6%, P = .008). Moreover, only 10 of 55 patients with both negative GM tests and pulmonary HRCT responded to empirical treatment, and 7 of these 10 patients did not take antifungal agents for prophylaxis. It suggested that these 2 diagnostic tools could not predict patients without adequate Candida prophylaxis well. Thus, we concluded that serum GM assays and pulmonary CT scan could find out patients who really need empirical antifungal therapy, which resulted in improving the efficiency of the treatment.",2011,21056109,no

Antifungal prophylaxis in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients: the unfinished tale of imperfect success.,"Antifungal prophylaxis in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients is a rapidly evolving field. For this prophylaxis to be beneficial and cost-effective, the risk of a life-threatening invasive fungal infection (IFI) should outweigh the risks of toxic effects and drug interactions introduced by the antifungal agent used. Not all hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients have the same risk of IFIs. New prophylactic strategies using risk stratification and new broad-spectrum antifungals have the potential for reducing IFI-associated mortality in these patients. Further refinement of risk stratification and risk/benefit analysis (including pharmacoeconomic analysis) is needed. Stratification of IFI risk could be further sharpened based on emerging genetic and metabolic risk factors. However, 10 years after deciphering the human genome, it is unclear whether the genomic revolution would pay off for identifying the SCT recipients at highest risk for IFIs. Empiricism and reliance on institution-specific epidemiologic data are still expected to be a major part of the 'art and science' of risk stratification for fungal infections in SCT.",2011,21042306,no
A photoelectrochemical immunosensor based on Au-doped TiO2 nanotube arrays for the detection of α-synuclein.,"α-Synuclein (α-SYN) is a very important neuronal protein that is associated with Parkinson's disease. In this paper, we utilized Au-doped TiO(2) nanotube arrays to design a photoelectrochemical immunosensor for the detection of α-SYN. The highly ordered TiO(2) nanotubes were fabricated by using an electrochemical anodization technique on pure Ti foil. After that, a photoelectrochemical deposition method was exploited to modify the resulting nanotubes with Au nanoparticles, which have been demonstrated to facilitate the improvement of photocurrent responses. Moreover, the Au-doped TiO(2) nanotubes formed effective antibody immobilization arrays and immobilized primary antibodies (Ab(1)) with high stability and bioactivity to bind target α-SYN. The enhanced sensitivity was obtained by using {Ab(2)-Au-GOx} bioconjugates, which featured secondary antibody (Ab(2)) and glucose oxidase (GOx) labels linked to Au nanoparticles for signal amplification. The GOx enzyme immobilized on the prepared immunosensor could catalyze glucose in the detection solution to produce H(2)O(2), which acted as a sacrificial electron donor to scavenge the photogenerated holes in the valence band of TiO(2) nanotubes upon irradiation of the other side of the Ti foil and led to a prompt photocurrent. The photocurrents were proportional to the α-SYN concentrations, and the linear range of the developed immunosensor was from 50 pg  mL(-1) to 100 ng  mL(-1) with a detection limit of 34 pg  mL(-1). The proposed method showed high sensitivity, stability, reproducibility, and could become a promising technique for protein detection.",2011,21038326,no
Probable invasive aspergillosis without prespecified radiologic findings: proposal for inclusion of a new category of aspergillosis and implications for studying novel therapies.,"The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the Mycosis Study Group (MSG) definition of invasive aspergillosis used in clinical trials lacks sensitivity. We hypothesize that giving lower weight to the prespecified radiologic findings in patients with a positive serum galactomannan index test result will improve the definition's diagnostic sensitivity.The medical records of 121 patients with 125 cases of invasive aspergillosis treated at a referral cancer institute from January 2003 through December 2009 were reviewed. Aspergillosis was diagnosed as EORTC-MSG proven or probable (controls, 83) or probable invasive aspergillosis without prespecified radiologic criteria (cases, 42). The latter differed from the former by the inclusion of patients whose pulmonary infiltrates, although well described in invasive aspergillosis, do not fulfill EORTC-MSG invasive aspergillosis requirements. The host, clinical, and mycologic characteristics and survival of cases and controls served as end points.A total of 114 (91%) of 125 patients had multiple myeloma. Patients had a median age was 65 years (range, 26-81 years), and 74 were male. All had received antineoplastic therapy, including stem cell transplantation (58 [46%]). Aspergillosis involved lungs (88 patients), sinuses (9 patients), or both (28 patients). Except for higher median baseline platelet count and shorter duration of neutropenia among cases, there were no statistically significant differences between groups on all predefined end points, including 4-, 6-, and 12-week survival. Eleven of 26 cases were reclassified as controls on the basis of subsequent imaging.Except for less well-circumscribed consolidations, the host, clinical, radiologic, and mycologic characteristics and outcome of patients with probable invasive aspergillosis but without prespecified radiologic criteria are similar to those with EORTC-MSG invasive aspergillosis. Enrolling such patients in clinical trials of novel therapies will increase the pool of eligible study participants and improve trial speed and efficiency.",2011,21034199,no
What makes Aspergillus fumigatus a successful pathogen? Genes and molecules involved in invasive aspergillosis.,"Aspergillus fumigatus is an opportunistic pathogen that causes 90% of invasive aspergillosis (IA) due to Aspergillus genus, with a 50-95% mortality rate. It has been postulated that certain virulence factors are characteristic of A. fumigatus, but the ""non-classical"" virulence factors seem to be highly variable. Overall, published studies have demonstrated that the virulence of this fungus is multifactorial, associated with its structure, its capacity for growth and adaptation to stress conditions, its mechanisms for evading the immune system and its ability to cause damage to the host. In this review we intend to give a general overview of the genes and molecules involved in the development of IA. The thermotolerance section focuses on five genes related with the capacity of the fungus to grow at temperatures above 30°C (thtA, cgrA, afpmt1, kre2/afmnt1, and hsp1/asp f 12). The following sections discuss molecules and genes related to interaction with the host and with the immune responses. These sections include β-glucan, α-glucan, chitin, galactomannan, galactomannoproteins (afmp1/asp f 17 and afmp2), hydrophobins (rodA/hyp1 and rodB), DHN-melanin, their respective synthases (fks1, rho1-4, ags1-3, chsA-G, och1-4, mnn9, van1, anp1, glfA, pksP/alb1, arp1, arp2, abr1, abr2, and ayg1), and modifying enzymes (gel1-7, bgt1, eng1, ecm33, afpigA, afpmt1-2, afpmt4, kre2/afmnt1, afmnt2-3, afcwh41 and pmi) several enzymes related to oxidative stress protection such as catalases (catA, cat1/catB, cat2/katG, catC, and catE), superoxide dismutases (sod1, sod2, sod3/asp f 6, and sod4), fatty acid oxygenases (ppoA-C), glutathione tranferases (gstA-E), and others (afyap1, skn7, and pes1)",2011,20974273,no
Aspergillus fumigatus cell wall components differentially modulate host TLR2 and TLR4 responses.,"Aspergillus fumigatus conidia attenuates host proinflammatory responses through modulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and TLR4 signaling, but the precise mechanisms that mediate this effect are not known. In the present study, the role of the Aspergillus cell wall polysaccharide constituents responsible for the modulation of host capability to mount a proinflammatory response was studied. Aspergillus cell wall fractions and its major components showed differential capabilities in modulating host TLR-mediated interleukin (IL)-6 production. Beta-glucan specifically suppressed TLR4-induced response, while alpha-glucan inhibited IL-6 induced through TLR2- and TLR4-stimulation. Galactomannan diminished TLR4-mediated response, while its inhibitory effects on TLR2-signaling were limited. Chitin, on the other hand, did not have significant immunomodulatory capability. The ability of the fungal cell wall to alter the immune signature of the pathogen may contribute to its virulence and the pathogenesis of co-infection.",2011,20971208,no
Improved mannan-degrading enzymes' production by Aspergillus niger through medium optimization.,"The effect of different carbon and nitrogen sources on the production of mannan-degrading enzymes, focussing on β-mannanase, by Aspergillus niger was investigated using shake flask culture. The β-mannanase activity obtained during growth of A. niger on guar gum (GG, 1495 nkat mL(-1)) was much higher than those observed on other carbon substrates, locust bean gum (1148 nkat mL(-1)), α-cellulose (10.7 nkat mL(-1)), glucose (8.8 nkat mL(-1)) and carboxymethylcellulose (4.6 nkat mL(-1)). For fermentation using GG as a carbon source, bacteriological peptone gave the highest β-mannanase activity (1744 nkat mL(-1)) followed by peptone from meat (1168 nkat mL(-1)), yeast extract (817 nkat mL(-1)), ammonium sulphate (241 nkat mL(-1)), ammonium nitrate (113 nkat mL(-1)) and ammonium chloride (99 nkat mL(-1)) when used as a nitrogen source. The composition of bacteriological peptone and initial pH of the medium were further optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). Medium consisted of 21.3 g L(-1) GG and 57 g L(-1) peptone with initial culture pH of 5.5 was optimum for β-mannanase production (2063 nkat mL(-1)) by A. niger. The β-mannanase production obtained in this study using A. niger was significantly higher than those reported in the literature.",2011,20970530,no
Epidemiology of invasive aspergillosis and risk factors in non neutropaenic patients.,"Invasive aspergillosis is a major cause of mortality in allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients and patients treated for blood malignancies. The diagnostic tools, treatments and preventive strategies, essentially developed for neutropaenic patients, have not been assessed in populations whose immune systems are considered to be competent.Beside the standard picture of chronic Aspergillus infection, the incidence of invasive aspergillosis is increasing in non neutropaenic patients, such as those with chronic lung diseases or systemic disease treated with long-term immunosuppressive drugs and solid organ transplant recipients. This study reviews the specific features of invasive aspergillosis in non neutropaenic subjects (NNS) and discusses the value of the diagnostic tools and treatment in this population.A better understanding of the pathophysiology and the epidemiological characteristics of invasive aspergillosis would provide a means of adapting the staging and classification of the disease for NNS.Invasive aspergillosis is under diagnosed in NNS who may already be colonised when they receive immunosuppressive treatment this can lead to an adverse outcome in patients who are considered to be a moderate risk population.",2011,20965392,no
The accuracy of serum galactomannan assay in diagnosing invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.,"Galactomannan (GM) antigen is an aspergillus specific antigen that is released during the growth phase of invasive aspergillosis. We aimed to find the optimum cutoff and accuracy of serum Galactomannan assay in immunocompromised patients. Immunocompromised patients diagnosed with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Mycosis Study Group (EORTC/MSG) with three levels of certainty proven, probable and possible, referred for GM antigen measurement at Immunology, Asthma and Allergy Research Institute (IAARI) from 2006 to 2009 and if they met the criteria were enrolled in this study. Totally 49 patients with IPA were enrolled in our study. According to EORTC/MSG, patients categorized into three levels of certainty: They were diagnosed as 'proven' invasive pulmonary aspergillosis 16(32.7%), 'probable' 18(36.7%) and 'possible' 15(30.6%). The most common host risk factor was solid tumors 17(34.7%). The accuracy of Galactomannan assay increased from 0.5 to 2 cutoffs. The optimum sensitivity and specificity obtained at the index cutoff of ≥1.5 for diagnosis of ""proven"" IPA which were respectively, 69.2% and 72.2%. Other cutoffs had high variance between sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of IPA. The calculated cutoff gained by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis for detecting proven IPA was 1.5. Intermediate accuracy of serum GM test in conjunct with clinical findings would help early IPA detection among immunocompromised patients.",2016,20952804,no
Value of consecutive galactomannan determinations for the diagnosis and prognosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in critically ill chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Critically ill chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients who are admitted to intensive care units (ICU) are at particular risk for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). The objective of this investigation was to assess the value of consecutive galactomannan (GM) tests in determining the diagnosis and prognosis of IPA in this patient population. We studied 90 critically ill COPD patients admitted to our ICU between February 2007 and November 2009. Two consecutive serum GM tests were done on the first and fourth days of their ICU admissions. Patients were classified as proven IPA (n = 1), probable IPA (n = 18), or non-IPA (n = 71). The sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values of GM test results for (i) the first test, (ii) the second test, (iii) at least one positive of two consecutive tests and (iv) two positive consecutive GM tests were, respectively, 57.9%/64.7%/70.6%/47.1% 87.3%/84.6%/80.8%/94.2%",2011,20936913,no
Invasive aspergillosis promotes tumor growth and severity in a tumor-bearing mouse model.,"Invasive aspergillosis increases in chronic immunosuppressive diseases such as cancer. There is little information about the mechanisms by which Aspergillus infection affects the immune regulation and microenvironment of cancer cells. Hence, this study was aimed at investigating the effect of invasive aspergillosis on immunosurveillance, metastasis, and prognosis of cancer in tumor-bearing mice. After implantation of mouse mammary tumor in BALB/c mice, they were infected with Aspergillus conidia intravenously. For comparison, groups of mice were experimentally infected with Aspergillus conidia or implanted with tumor cells separately. Seven days after Aspergillus infection, the serum levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) were measured by ELISA, and subsequently regulatory T lymphocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry. The survival of animals and mean tumor size were then determined. Our results indicated that tumor sizes in mice increased significantly after infection with Aspergillus conidia. Moreover, invasive aspergillosis enhanced the population of regulatory lymphocytes and level of TIMP-1. This study supports the idea that massive Aspergillus infection could stimulate tumor growth and increases the possibility of a bad prognosis. As a result, treatment of Aspergillus infection could be considered an important issue for efficient cancer therapy.",2010,20921987,no
Saccharomyces cerevisiae coq10 null mutants are responsive to antimycin A.,"Deletion of COQ10 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae elicits a respiratory defect characterized by the absence of cytochrome c reduction, which is correctable by the addition of exogenous diffusible coenzyme Q(2). Unlike other coq mutants with hampered coenzyme Q(6) (Q(6) ) synthesis, coq10 mutants have near wild-type concentrations of Q(6). In the present study, we used Q-cycle inhibitors of the coenzyme QH(2)-cytochrome c reductase complex to assess the electron transfer properties of coq10 cells. Our results show that coq10 mutants respond to antimycin A, indicating an active Q-cycle in these mutants, even though they are unable to transport electrons through cytochrome c and are not responsive to myxothiazol. EPR spectroscopic analysis also suggests that wild-type and coq10 mitochondria accumulate similar amounts of Q(6) semiquinone, despite a lower steady-state level of coenzyme QH(2)-cytochrome c reductase complex in the coq10 cells. Confirming the reduced respiratory chain state in coq10 cells, we found that the expression of the Aspergillus fumigatus alternative oxidase in these cells leads to a decrease in antimycin-dependent H(2)O(2) release and improves their respiratory growth.",2010,20875086,no
"PKC signaling regulates drug resistance of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans via circuitry comprised of Mkc1, calcineurin, and Hsp90.","Fungal pathogens exploit diverse mechanisms to survive exposure to antifungal drugs. This poses concern given the limited number of clinically useful antifungals and the growing population of immunocompromised individuals vulnerable to life-threatening fungal infection. To identify molecules that abrogate resistance to the most widely deployed class of antifungals, the azoles, we conducted a screen of 1,280 pharmacologically active compounds. Three out of seven hits that abolished azole resistance of a resistant mutant of the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a clinical isolate of the leading human fungal pathogen Candida albicans were inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), which regulates cell wall integrity during growth, morphogenesis, and response to cell wall stress. Pharmacological or genetic impairment of Pkc1 conferred hypersensitivity to multiple drugs that target synthesis of the key cell membrane sterol ergosterol, including azoles, allylamines, and morpholines. Pkc1 enabled survival of cell membrane stress at least in part via the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade in both species, though through distinct downstream effectors. Strikingly, inhibition of Pkc1 phenocopied inhibition of the molecular chaperone Hsp90 or its client protein calcineurin. PKC signaling was required for calcineurin activation in response to drug exposure in S. cerevisiae. In contrast, Pkc1 and calcineurin independently regulate drug resistance via a common target in C. albicans. We identified an additional level of regulatory control in the C. albicans circuitry linking PKC signaling, Hsp90, and calcineurin as genetic reduction of Hsp90 led to depletion of the terminal MAPK, Mkc1. Deletion of C. albicans PKC1 rendered fungistatic ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors fungicidal and attenuated virulence in a murine model of systemic candidiasis. This work establishes a new role for PKC signaling in drug resistance, novel circuitry through which Hsp90 regulates drug resistance, and that targeting stress response signaling provides a promising strategy for treating life-threatening fungal infections.",2010,20865172,no
Fungal colonization in patients with chronic respiratory diseases from Himalayan region of India.,"We screened patients with chronic respiratory diseases for microbiological and serological evidences of fungal colonisation in order to determine its prevalence in this group of patients, examine potential clinical and radiological predictors of fungal colonisation and characterise fungal agents associated with individual diseases.BAL samples from 60 consecutive patients were subjected to microscopy and culture for fungal agents. Serum samples were analysed for precipitin antibodies to Aspergillus antigen and Candida cytoplasmic antigen. Statistical significance in the difference of fungal recovery between patient groups was determined using the Chi-square test.The major diagnostic groups included patients with bronchogenic carcinoma (n = 31) and tubercular sequelae (n = 16). In all, 28 patients (46.7%) were culture-positive, with Candida and Aspergillus being recovered from 14 and 13 patients respectively. Twenty-one patients (35%) showed presence of precipitin antibodies. Patients with bronchogenic carcinoma showed increased predilection for colonisation with Aspergillus, while Candida was recovered more commonly in tubercular sequelae (p = 0.02). There was no statistically significant association between culture-positivity and specific risk factors/radiological findings.The point-prevalence of fungal colonization was almost 50%. The combination of fungal culture and serology helped improve diagnostic sensitivity. An interesting predilection was observed for Aspergillus and Candida, to preferentially infect patients with Bronchogenic carcinoma and Tubercular sequelae respectively. In absence of specific predictors, the possibility of fungal colonization needs to be explored actively in these patients.",2010,20854652,no
Assessment of infection risks prior to lung transplantation.,"Infections are major causes of morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation. Pretransplant evaluation can identify patients at risk of infectious complications and guide prophylactic strategies post transplantation. This review focuses on studies published from 2006 to the present that relate to the assessment of risk of infection prior to lung transplantation.Pretransplant airways colonization with Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, nontuberculosis mycobacteria, Aspergillus and Scedosporium tend to recur after transplantation and cause disease in the lung allograft. Recently, colonization with Pseudomonas and Aspergillus species has been implicated in the subsequent development of allograft dysfunction. B. cenocepacia and Mycobacterium abscessus are particularly associated with poor outcomes after lung transplantation and are considered to be relative contra-indications to lung transplantation in many centers. Tuberculin skin test (TST) has limited value in predicting tuberculosis (TB) reactivation however, in the absence of a better test, it remains the gold standard for screening patients with latent TB. Serologic screening for histoplasmosis and toxoplasmosis has limited value as these infections rarely occur after lung transplantation.Recurrence of pretransplant airway infection and reactivation of latent infection are potential sources of infection after lung transplantation. Prospective studies are needed to determine the efficacy of prophylactic antimicrobial strategies.",2011,20847696,no
Clinical utility and prognostic value of bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan in patients with hematologic malignancies.,"We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study to determine the performance characteristics of the galactomannan (GM) assay in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in patients with hematologic malignancies. Patients were classified as proven, probable, possible, or no invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), according to international guidelines. A total of 173 BAL samples from 145 patients were included. There were 5 proven, 7 probable, and 35 possible cases of IPA. Using a GM index cutoff of ≥ 0.5, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) of the BAL GM assay were 100%, 78%, 26%, and 100%, respectively. Using a GM index cutoff of ≥ 2.0, the sensitivity and NPV remained 100%, but specificity and PPV increased to 93% and 50%, respectively. The BAL GM assay is a highly sensitive screening test for IPA in patients with hematologic malignancies. Increasing the cutoff value to 2.0 would improve the performance of this assay.",2011,20846585,no
Aspergillus galactomannan antigen assay in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.,"A recently developed bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) galactomannan (GM) assay shows promising results. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of this assay and analyzed risk factors for false-positive results.A prospective cohort study was performed in a tertiary hospital over a 9-month period. We reviewed all adult patients who underwent GM assays of BAL. Patients were categorized with proven, probable, or possible invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) according to revised EORTC/MSG definitions. Each patient with a false-positive BAL GM result was matched with three patients with true-negative BAL GM result, and the risk factors for false-positive BAL GM results were determined.Of 359 enrolled patients, 22 (6%) were diagnosed with IPA (1 proven, 17 probable, and 4 possible). Of the 22 patients with IPA, 17 (77%) had already received antifungal agents before the BAL GM assay was conducted. At an index cutoff value of ≥0.5, the BAL GM assay had a sensitivity of 64% (95% CI 41%-83%) and a specificity of 89% (95% CI 85%-92%). However, at an index cutoff value of ≥0.2, the BAL GM assay had a sensitivity of 86% (95% CI 65%-97%) and a specificity of 74% (95% CI 69%-79%). Of the 52 patients with positive BAL GM assay (≥0.5), 25 (7%) were false-positives. Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam or ampicillin-sulbactam was associated with false-positive BAL GM results.The BAL GM assay appears promising for the diagnosis of IPA. However, treatment with certain antibiotics may interfere with the results of the BAL GM assay.",2011,20833201,no
New molecular and surrogate biomarker-based tests in the diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infection in febrile neutropenic patients.,"Prompt diagnosis of infection in febrile neutropenia hosts with hematological malignancy is essential in directing therapy. We highlight experience using modern molecular and biomarker-based methods to diagnose bacterial and fungal bloodstream infections and invasive aspergillosis in these patients.Nucleic acid amplification-based strategies are used to detect and identify pathogens from blood cultures or from blood/clinical specimens the latter are more likely to influence clinical management. Advances in DNA extraction include standardization of isolation of Aspergillus DNA from blood. Broad-range and/or multiplex PCR generally have greater clinical utility than pathogen-specific assays. However, Aspergillus-PCR assays are useful in confirming/excluding disease and monitoring high-risk patients for invasive aspergillosis. Commercial real-time PCR/peptide nucleic acid fluorescent in-situ hybridization systems, used as adjuncts to blood cultures, to detect bacteria and fungi in blood cultures (or blood), are as sensitive as culture and enable earlier institution of targeted therapy. Yet there are no data indicating that molecular detection of bacterial/fungal pathogens influences patient outcomes. Positive serum Aspergillus galactomannan and 1,3-β-D-glucan tests are useful biomarkers in the diagnosis/screening of fungal infection, and have potential as measures of response to antifungal therapy. Serum procalcitonin levels can help differentiate infectious, from noninfectious, fever. Combined molecular and nonmolecular testing likely offers optimal diagnostic accuracy.Numerous PCR-based and biomarker tools are available for the diagnosis and screening of infection in febrile neutropenia hosts. The optimal approach remains to be resolved by prospective studies examining the impact of one or more of tests on patient outcomes.",2011,20827189,no
"Randomized, double-blind trial of fluconazole versus voriconazole for prevention of invasive fungal infection after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.","Invasive fungal infection (IFI) is a serious threat after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). This multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial compared fluconazole (N = 295) versus voriconazole (N = 305) for the prevention of IFI in the context of a structured fungal screening program. Patients undergoing myeloablative allogeneic HCT were randomized before HCT to receive study drugs for 100 days, or for 180 days in higher-risk patients. Serum galactomannan was assayed twice weekly for 60 days, then at least weekly until day 100. Positive galactomannan or suggestive signs triggered mandatory evaluation for IFI. The primary endpoint was freedom from IFI or death (fungal-free survival FFS) at 180 days. Despite trends to fewer IFIs (7.3% vs 11.2%",2011,20826719,no
A prospective comparison of galactomannan in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for the diagnosis of pulmonary invasive aspergillosis in medical patients under intensive care: comparison with the diagnostic performance of galactomannan and of (1→ 3)-β-d-glucan chromogenic assay in serum samples.,"Diagnosis of fungal pneumonia (FP) in critically ill patients is challenging. Circulating biomarkers for the diagnosis of FP have limitations and the combination of different assays in serum samples and directly from the target organ may further improve the diagnosis of FP. We prospectively assessed the diagnostic utility of paired galactomannan (GM) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) and serum GM and (1→3)-β-D-glucan (BG) assays in critically ill patients at risk of FP. Patients with FP were classified according to European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Mycoses Study Group criteria, with modifications. Out of 847 admissions, 51 patients were eligible. There were nine invasive aspergillosis (IA) cases (four proven, five probable), three proven Pneumocysitis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) cases and one mixed FP case (probable IA and proven PJP). The diagnostic accuracy as given by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in IA cases (proven and probable) for GM in BAL was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.94-1.00), whilst for GM and BG in serum it was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.74-0.96) and 0.815 (95% CI, 0.66-0.96), respectively. For IA cases (proven and probable) AUC for GM in BAL was significantly higher than GM and BG in serum (p 0.025 and p 0.032, respectively). In one of four proven and one of six probable IA cases, GM in serum remained negative, whereas GM in BAL was positive. In patients with IA, GM (90%) and BG (80%) appeared a mean of 4.3 days (range, 1-10 days) before Aspergillus was cultured. GM detection in BAL appears to improve the diagnosis of IA in critical patients.",2011,20825441,no

Differential transcriptional profiles induced by amphotericin B formulations on human monocytes during response to hyphae of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Amphotericin B formulations possess diverse immunomodulatory properties that may contribute to the activity of phagocytes against invasive aspergillosis. In this work we provide a novel set of data on different gene transcriptional profiles of monocytes exposed to the combination of Aspergillus fumigatus and amphotericin B formulations. We used pathway-specific microarray analysis, RT-PCR analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to compare the effects of amphotericin B deoxycholate (DAMB) at 1 μg/ml and amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC) at 5 μg/ml to assess gene expression of immune molecules of THP-1 cells exposed to A. fumigatus hyphae (AF) for 4 h. A. fumigatus hyphae at effector/target ratio 10/1 induced mostly chemotactic factors for monocyte recruitment. DAMB at 1 μg/ml in the presence or absence of AF induced the most pronounced changes in pro-inflammatory and chemokine gene expression, while ABLC under the same conditions caused less dramatic effect. There was a reciprocal response of increased expression of the genes encoding IL-1β and IL-20 and decreased expression of IL-10, IL-2 and IL-3 in response of monocytes to both the hyphae and antifungal agents. These results demonstrate that amphotericin B formulations exert differential effects on genes encoding pro-inflammatory molecules, immunoregulatory molecules and chemokines by human monocytes during response to A. fumigatus and that these molecules may affect antifungal activity.",2011,20807031,no
Rapid visual tests: fast and reliable detection of ochratoxin A.,"This paper reviews the early detection strategies that have been employed for the rapid monitoring of ochratoxin A (OTA) contamination of food. OTA, a mycotoxin mainly produced by some Aspergillus and Penicillium species, is found in cereals, coffee, wine, pork and grapes. To minimize the entry of this mycotoxin into the food chain, rapid diagnostic tools are required. To this end, the potential use of lateral flow devices has also been developed. In this study, we analyze the robustness of test strips using published methods for colorimetric detection. Different test formats are discussed, and challenges in the development of lateral flow devices for on-site determination of OTA, with requirements such as robustness, speed, and cost-effectiveness, are discussed.",2010,22069682,no
Repercussion of a deficiency in mitochondrial ß-oxidation on the carbon flux of short-chain fatty acids to the peroxisomal ß-oxidation cycle in Aspergillus nidulans.,"The fungus Aspergillus nidulans contains both a mitochondrial and peroxisomal ß-oxidation pathway. This work was aimed at studying the influence of mutations in the foxA gene, encoding a peroxisomal multifunctional protein, or in the scdA/echA genes, encoding a mitochondrial short-chain dehydrogenase and an enoyl-CoA hydratase, respectively, on the carbon flux to the peroxisomal ß-oxidation pathway. A. nidulans transformed with a peroxisomal polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase produced PHA from the polymerization of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediates derived from the peroxisomal ß-oxidation of external fatty acids. PHA produced from erucic acid or heptadecanoic acid contained a broad spectrum of monomers, ranging from 5 to 14 carbons, revealing that the peroxisomal ß-oxidation cycle can handle both long and short-chain intermediates. While the ∆foxA mutant grown on erucic acid or oleic acid synthesized 10-fold less PHA compared to wild type, the same mutant grown on octanoic acid or heptanoic acid produced 3- to 6-fold more PHA. Thus, while FoxA has an important contribution to the degradation of long-chain fatty acids, the flux of short-chain fatty acids to peroxisomal ß-oxidation is actually enhanced in its absence. While no change in PHA was observed in the ∆scdA∆echA mutant grown on erucic acid or oleic acid compared to wild type, there was a 2- to 4-fold increased synthesis of PHA in ∆scdA∆echA cells grown in octanoic acid or heptanoic acid. These results reveal that a compensatory mechanism exists in A. nidulans that increases the flux of short-chain fatty acids towards the peroxisomal ß-oxidation cycle when the mitochondrial ß-oxidation pathway is defective.",2010,20736083,no
"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis due to Aspergillus terreus: value of DNA, galactomannan and (1->3)-beta-D-glucan detection in serum samples as an adjunct to diagnosis.","A case of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis caused by Aspergillus terreus is described.

Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and Aspergillus infection in cystic fibrosis.,"Recent literature on Aspergillus fumigatus infection and allergy in cystic fibrosis have expanded our understanding of many aspects of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and bring new attention to A. fumigatus airways infection and A. fumigatus allergy without allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA).ABPA, A. fumigatus infection and A. fumigatus allergy without ABPA all likely worsen cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Studies examining utility of new serologic assays for diagnosing ABPA include evaluations of standardized measurement of A. fumigatus-specific IgG, serum chemokine TARC levels, and recombinant A. fumigatus allergens as yet, none appear ideal. Although oral glucocorticoids remain primary therapy, toxicity and incomplete control have led to an ongoing search for further safe and effective agents including itraconazole and voriconazole, intravenous pulse methylprednisolone, nebulized amphotericin B and omalizumab. Little controlled treatment data is available.Diagnosis of CF-ABPA remains difficult, but improvements in serologic assays are occurring. Treatment remains in many cases unsatisfactory, and new agents offer promise but await proper controlled trials of safety and efficacy. A. fumigatus airway infection and A. fumigatus allergy without ABPA are emerging as further complications of A. fumigatus respiratory colonization in patients with CF, but prospective studies are needed to corroborate largely retrospective findings.",2011,20720494,no
Invasive aspergillosis in developing countries.,"To review invasive aspergillosis (IA) in developing countries, we included those countries, which are mentioned in the document of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), called the Emerging and Developing Economies List, 2009. A PubMed/Medline literature search was performed for studies concerning IA reported during 1970 through March 2010 from these countries. IA is an important cause of morbidity and mortality of hospitalized patients of developing countries, though the exact frequency of the disease is not known due to inadequate reporting and facilities to diagnose. Only a handful of centers from India, China, Thailand, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Sudan, South Africa, Turkey, Hungary, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Argentina had reported case series of IA. As sub-optimum hospital care practice, hospital renovation work in the vicinity of immunocompromised patients, overuse or misuse of steroids and broad-spectrum antibiotics, use of contaminated infusion sets/fluid, and increase in intravenous drug abusers have been reported from those countries, it is expected to find a high rate of IA among patients with high risk, though hard data is missing in most situations. Besides classical risk factors for IA, liver failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and tuberculosis are the newly recognized underlying diseases associated with IA. In Asia, Africa and Middle East sino-orbital or cerebral aspergillosis, and Aspergillus endophthalmitis are emerging diseases and Aspergillus flavus is the predominant species isolated from these infections. The high frequency of A. flavus isolation from these patients may be due to higher prevalence of the fungus in the environment. Cerebral aspergillosis cases are largely due to an extension of the lesion from invasive Aspergillus sinusitis. The majority of the centers rely on conventional techniques including direct microscopy, histopathology, and culture to diagnose IA. Galactomannan, β-D glucan test, and DNA detection in IA are available only in a few centers. Mortality of the patients with IA is very high due to delays in diagnosis and therapy. Antifungal use is largely restricted to amphotericin B deoxycholate and itraconazole, though other anti-Aspergillus antifungal agents are available in those countries. Clinicians are aware of good outcome after use of voriconazole/liposomal amphotericin B/caspofungin, but they are forced to use amphotericin B deoxycholate or itraconazole in public-sector hospitals due to economic reasons.",2012,20718613,no
"The initial 96 hours of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis: histopathology, comparative kinetics of galactomannan and (1->3) β-d-glucan and consequences of delayed antifungal therapy.","Acute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a rapidly progressive and frequently lethal infection. Relatively little is known about early events in the pathogenesis and relationship between the cell wall biomarkers galactomannan and (1→3)-β-d-glucan. The consequences of delayed antifungal therapy are also poorly defined. A persistently neutropenic rabbit model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was used to describe the histopathology of early invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and the kinetics of galactomannan and (1→3)-β-d-glucan. The time course of both molecules was mathematically modeled by using a population methodology, and Monte Carlo simulations were performed. The effect of progressive delay in the administration of amphotericin B deoxycholate 1 mg/kg at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h postinoculation on fungal burden, lung weight, pulmonary infarct score, and survival was determined. Histopathology showed phagocytosis of conidia by pulmonary alveolar macrophages at 4 h postinoculation. At 12 to 24 h, there was a progressive focal inflammatory response with conidial germination and hyphal extension. Subsequently, hyphae invaded into the contiguous lung. Galactomannan and (1→3)-β-d-glucan had similar trajectories, and both exhibited considerable interindividual variability, which was reflected in Monte Carlo simulations. Concentrations of both molecules began to rise <24 h postinoculation before pulmonary hemorrhagic infarction was present. Delays of 72 and 96 h in the administration of amphotericin B resulted in fungal burdens and lung weights that were indistinguishable from those of controls, respectively. Galactomannan and (1→3)-β-d-glucan have similar kinetics and are comparable biomarkers of early invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Antifungal treatment at ≥48 h postinoculation is associated with suboptimal therapeutic outcomes.",2011,20713673,no
Early Diagnosis of Invasive Aspergillosis in Neutropenic Patients. Comparison between Serum Galactomannan and Polymerase Chain Reaction.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in profoundly neutropenic patients, so early diagnosis is mandatory.Consecutive patients with hematological malignancies undergoing intensive chemotherapy were screened for IA with two different methods which were compared.From October 2000 to August 2003 we tested 1311 serum samples from 172 consecutive patients with a polymerase chain reaction assay and between April 2005 and April 2008 we tested 806 serum samples from 169 consecutive patients with a Galactomannan (GM) test. Bronchoalveolar (BAL) samples were obtained whenever the patient's condition allowed and tested with either method.The serum PCR assay had a sensitivity of 75.0% and a specificity of 91.9% and the serum GM assay had a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 93.1%, (P > 0.05). The presence of two or more consecutive positive serum samples was predictive of IA for both assays. BAL GM/PCR was positive in some patients without serum positivity and in patients with 2 or more positive serum GM/PCR.No significant differences between the 2 serum tests were found. The GM assay has the advantage of being standardized among several laboratories and is incorporated in the criteria established by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycosis Study Group (EORTC/MSG), however is much more expensive. BAL GM and PCR sampling aids in IA diagnosis but needs further validation studies to differentiate between colonization and true infection in cases where serum GM or PCR are negative.",2010,20703324,no

β-Galactofuranose-containing structures present in the cell wall of the saprophytic fungus Cladosporium (Hormoconis) resinae.,"A peptidogalactomannan was isolated from mycelia of Cladosporium (Hormoconis) resinae and characterized using methylation-fragmentation analysis, partial acid hydrolysis and ¹H and ¹³C-NMR spectroscopy. The galactomannan component was a branched structure and consisted of a main chain containing (1→6)-linked α-d-Manp residues substituted at O-2 by side chains containing (1→2)-linked α-D-Manp residues. β-D-Galf residues were present as side chains of 3-4 units that are (1→5)-interlinked. This structure is very similar to a pGM isolated from Aspergillus fumigatus and differs from that of Cladosporium werneckii (currently named Hortaea werneckii), with this pGM and other fungal galactomannans having single terminal (1→6)-linked β-Galf residues. The importance of the carbohydrate moiety of Cladosporium resinae pGM in immunoassays was also demonstrated. On FACS examination, a decrease (60%) in rabbit serum anti- C. resinae binding to C. resinae conidia occurred when this serum had been previously incubated with pGMs from C. resinae and A. fumigatus or with mannoprotein from Candida parapsilosis, suggesting the presence of cross-reactive determinants in these fungi.",2010,20696239,no
Penicillium marneffei infection in an African man.,"Penicilliosis is a systemic fungal infection caused by Penicillium marneffei. The infection is most commonly seen in Southeast Asia, Southern China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. It is rarely seen among individuals of African descent. Here, we report a case of penicilliosis in an African man from Namibia who was studying in Malaysia. He presented with multiple umbilicated papules associated with cough, fever, loss of appetite, and weight. He also had urethral discharge and admitted to unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple partners. Histopathological examination of a skin papule showed the presence of multiple 2 to 4 microm intracellular yeast cells. Culture of the papule revealed Penicillium marneffei. The serology for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was positive. This case illustrates the need to recognize penicilliosis in any individuals staying or travelling to Southeast Asia and the need to look for underlying HIV infection in adults with umbilicated papules.",2010,20673530,no
[Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].,"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a severe disease, specially among immunocompromised patients. Its frequency increases in other patients such as those with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), mainly when steroids are prescribed. The most common form of presentation is a respiratory tract infection with poor response to antimicrobial treatment. The delay in its diagnosis is one of the main causes of its high lethality. Once suspected, respiratory secretion cultures, chest X ray examination and computed tomography should be obtained and galactomannan, a marker of hematogenous dissemination of the microorganism, should be determined. Although the repeated isolation of Aspergillus spp is suggestive of invasive disease, the definitive diagnosis requires cytopathological confirmation. Further studies should be performed in these patients, since the available information was obtained from the observations made in immunocompromised patients, and may not be applicable accurately to API among COPD patients.",2011,20668818,no
"Physico-chemical and clinico-immunologic studies on the allergenic significance of Aspergillus tamarii, a common airborne fungus.","Aspergillus-derived inhalant allergens play an important role in the etiology of allergic respiratory diseases. In the present study, we investigated the allergenic potential of Aspergillus tamarii, quantified its airborne content, identified its major/minor allergens, evaluated heterogeneity of patients' IgE response to its allergens and cross-reactivity of its allergens with other Aspergillus allergens. Skin prick tests with A tamarii extract were performed on 300 patients of bronchial asthma/allergic rhinitis and 20 healthy volunteers. Sixty-six patients (22%) elicited positive cutaneous reactions to A tamarii extract. Only one of the 20 non-allergic healthy volunteer showed a mild positive cutaneous reaction. Allergen-specific IgE levels increased with increase in patients' cutaneous response (0% in negative to 100% in 3+/4+). The skin positivity and allergen-specific IgE levels were significantly higher in patients compared to healthy volunteers (P>0.05). However, no differences were found for these two parameters among patients of bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma with allergic rhinitis. The airborne A tamarii allergen content was highest in February and October. A tamarii extract revealed at least 22 proteins (13.3-120 kDa). Seventeen of these proteins bound patients' IgE with six being major allergens (13.3, 23, 25, 34, 39.5, 43 kDa). Three major allergens (13.3, 34, 43 kDa) were found to cross-react with A flavus and one (34 kDa) with A niger. Our results revealed that A tamarii allergen(s) are present in the air, which might serve as important inhalant allergens in IgE-mediated allergic respiratory diseases.",2011,20667623,no
"Molecular and immunological characterization of subtilisin like serine protease, a major allergen of Curvularia lunata.","Serine protease from numerous sources have been identified and characterized as major allergens. The present study aimed to clone, express and characterize a serine protease from Curvularia lunata. cDNA library screening identified partial protease clones. A clone showed significant homology to subtilisin like serine proteases from Aspergillus and Penicillium species. Full length sequence was generated by RACE PCR, subcloned in pET vector, protein expressed in Escherichia coli and purified from inclusion bodies yielding 0.5 mg/L of culture. Bioinformatic analysis identified serine protease motifs of subtilase family, catalytic triad and N-glycosylation sites on the primary sequence. The protein resolved at 54-kDa on SDS-PAGE and was recognized as a major allergen on immunoblot with 13/16 C. lunata sensitive patients' sera in ELISA and immunoblot. Recombinant protein reacted with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against alkaline serine proteases from C. lunata. Recombinant protein required 50-56 ng of same protein for 50% inhibition of IgE binding in competitive ELISA. In addition, 13 of 16 patients' samples showed significant basophil histamine release upon stimulation with purified recombinant protein. In conclusion, a 54 kDa major allergen of C. lunata was cloned, expressed, characterized and showed biological activity. It has potential to be used in molecule based approach for allergy diagnosis and therapy.",2011,20667621,no
Causative pathogens of fever in neutropenic patients at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital.,"Infections cause substantial morbidity and morbidity in neutropenic patients. In King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Gram-negative bacteria remained the most common causative pathogen of febrile neutropenia in all three studies conducted before 2002. However, Gram-positive bacteria have become more commonly isolated etiologic pathogens, and the incidence of fungal infection has been increasing since 2005.Determine the infectious etiology of fever in neutropenic patients at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand.A retrospective chart review of all medical records of febrile neutropenic patients hospitalized at Department of Medicine between January 1 and December 31, 2006 in accompanying with microbiologic, radiologic, and serologic results was analyzed.There were 125 patients (61 males and 64 females) and 172 episodes of febrile neutropenia with a mean age of 46.5 +/- 18.5 years (range: 15-81 years). The three most common primary diseases associated with neutropenia were acute myeloid leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (36.6%, 33.1%, and 10.5%). Infections could be documented microbiologically and clinically in 84 episodes (48.8%), and primary bacteremia or fungemia was the most common cause of infection (40.5%). Gram-negative bacteria were the most frequently isolated pathogens (63.9%), followed by Gram-positive bacteria (29.9%) and fungi (6.2%). Escherichia coli (46.8%) and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (27.6%) were the most common isolates among Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively. Among 53 episodes (30.8%) of bloodstream infections, Gram-negative bacteria were the most commonly isolated pathogens (38 episodes, 71.7%), followed by Gram-positive bacteria (19 episodes, 35.8%) and Candida tropicalis (1 episode, 1.9%). Surprisingly, invasive mold infections were noted in eight episodes (5, 1, and 2 episodes of proven, probable, and possible infections, respectively). The overall mortality was 19.2%.Although Gram-negative bacteria are the most common etiology of fever in neutropenic patients, the occurrence of infections caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and molds has been increasing in comparison with the observations from previous studies in King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. To authors knowledge, the present study is the first in Thailand to determine the occurrence of invasive fungal infections using the standard criteria recommended by EORTC/MSG.",2010,20649055,no
TNFR1 mRNA expression level and TNFR1 gene polymorphisms are predictive markers for susceptibility to develop invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.,"Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is primarily secreted by monocytes/macrophages and activated T lymphocytes in response to fungal infections. TNF acts through TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) triggering a pro-inflammatory response, and therefore plays a pivotal role in immune regulation and host immune responses. We hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TNFR1 gene may influence the innate immune response against Aspergillus. Three SNPs were genotyped in 275 individuals (144 immunocompromised haematological patients with high-risk of developing IPA and 131 healthy controls): TNFR1(-383(A/C)) (rs2234649) and TNFR1(-609(G/T)) (rs4149570) in the 5 prime UTR region, and TNFR1(+36(A/G)) SNP (rs767455) in the first exon of the gene. Of the 144 haematological patients, 77 patients developed Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis (IPA) infection and the remaining 67 patients were not infected. TNFR1(+36(A/G)) and TNFR1(-609(G/T)) were associated with IPA susceptibility (p=0.033 and p=0.018, respectively). A role of TNFR1 genetic variants in the susceptibility of patients to develop IPA was also supported by the significantly lower TNFR1 mRNA expression level in IPA than in IPA-resistant patients and the strong correlation between the TNFR1(-609) genetic variant and the expression levels of TNFR1. There was also a tendency for a higher frequency of galactomannan (GM) positivity in patients with TNFR1(-609G/G) genotype than in patients with TNFR1(-609G/T) (p=0.0909) or TNFR1(-609T/T) (p=0.0913) genotype. Predictive sequence analysis of the effects of TNFR1(-609) promoter polymorphism revealed that this SNP might play a critical role in modifying the affinity of ICSBP/IRF-8, a transcription factor that is involved in the TNFR1-mediated activation of NFkappaB signalling pathway. Taken together, these data suggest that TNFR1 polymorphisms influence the risk of IPA disease and might be useful for risk stratification strategies. These findings need to be confirmed in validation studies with larger samples of haematological patients.",2010,20646338,no
"No interference of the 1,3-β-D-glucan containing nutritional supplement ImunixX with the 1,3-β-D-glucan serum test.","The detection of 1,3-β-D-glucan serum levels may permit establishing the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections more early.

All levels were negative, even in two different dosing regimens.",2011,20637053,no
A retrospective series of gut aspergillosis in haematology patients.,"Gut invasive aspergillosis is an extremely rare infection in immunocompromised patients. The goal of this retrospective multicentre study is to report on cases of gut aspergillosis in haematology patients, including clinical presentation, risk factors, and outcome. Twenty-one patients from nine centres were identified. Eight had isolated gut aspergillosis, with no evidence of other infected sites, and 13 had disseminated aspergillosis. Thirteen patients had acute leukaemia. Nine were allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients. Clinical symptoms and imaging were poorly specific. The galactomannan antigenaemia test result was positive in 16/25 (64%) patients, including in four of the eight cases of isolated gut aspergillosis. Five of 21 patients had a dietary regimen rich in spices, suggesting that, in these cases, food could have been the source of gut colonization, and then of a primary gut Aspergillus lesion. The diagnosis was made post-mortem in six patients. The mortality rate in the remaining patients at 12 weeks was 7/15 (47%). Gut aspergillosis is probably misdiagnosed and underestimated in haematology patients, owing to the poor specificity of symptoms and imaging. Patients with a persistently positive galactomannan antigenaemia finding that is unexplained by respiratory lesions should be suspected of having gut aspergillosis in the presence of abdominal symptoms, and be quickly investigated. In the absence of severe abdominal complications leading to surgery and resection of the lesions, the optimal treatment is not yet defined.",2011,20636423,no
Recombinant allergens combined with biological markers in the diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in cystic fibrosis patients.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a frequent complication in cystic fibrosis patients.

The aim of this study was to analyze the added value of two recombinant antigens, rAspf4 and rAspf6, associated with the detection of specific IgG precipitins",2010,20631331,no
A survey of pre-harvest ear rot diseases of maize and associated mycotoxins in south and central Zambia.,"Maize ear rots reduce grain yield and quality with implication on food security and health. Some of the pathogenic fungi produce mycotoxins in maize grain posing a health risk to humans and livestock. Unfortunately, the levels of ear rot and mycotoxin infection in grain produced by subsistence farmers in sub-Saharan countries are not known. A survey was thus conducted to determine the prevalence of the ear rot problem and levels of mycotoxins in maize grain. A total of 114 farmsteads were randomly sampled from 11 districts in Lusaka and southern provinces in Zambia during 2006. Ten randomly picked cobs were examined per farmstead and the ear rot disease incidence and severity were estimated on site. This was followed by the standard seed health testing procedures for fungal isolation in the laboratory. Results indicated that the dominant ear rots were caused by Fusarium and Stenocarpella. Incidence of Fusarium verticillioides ranged from 2 to 21%, whereas that of Stenocarpella maydis reached 37% on ear rot diseased maize grain. In addition, 2-7% F. verticillioides, and 3-18% Aspergillus flavus, respectively, were recovered from seemingly healthy maize grain. The mean rank of fungal species, from highest to lowest, was F. verticillioides, S. maydis, A. flavus, Fusarium graminearum, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium spp., Botrydiplodia spp., and Cladosporium spp. The direct competitive ELISA-test indicated higher levels of fumonisins than aflatoxins in pre-harvest maize grain samples. The concentration of fumonisins from six districts, and aflatoxin from two districts, was 10-fold higher than 2 ppm and far higher than 2 ppb maximum daily intake recommended by the FAO/WHO. The study therefore suggested that subsistence farmers and consumers in this part of Zambia, and maybe also in similar environments in sub-Saharan Africa, might be exposed to dangerous levels of mycotoxins due to the high levels of ear rot infections in maize grain.",2010,20626099,no
Risk factors associated with invasive fungal disease in children with cancer and febrile neutropenia: a prospective multicenter evaluation.,"Empiric antifungal treatment has become standard of care in children with cancer and prolonged fever and febrile neutropenia (FN), with the downside that it leads to significant over treatment. We characterized epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory features of invasive fungal disease (IFD) in children with cancer and FN with the aim to identify risk factors for IFD that can aid in better selecting children who require antifungal treatment.In a prospective, multicenter study, children admitted with FN at high-risk for sepsis, in 6 hospitals in Santiago, Chile were monitored from admission until the end of the FN episode. Monitoring included periodic evaluation of clinical findings, absolute neutrophil count, absolute monocyte count (AMC), serum C-reactive protein (CRP), bacterial cultures, imaging studies, and galactomannan antigen. A diagnosis of proven, probable, and possible IFD was made after episode resolution based on European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer classification.A total of 646 high-risk FN episodes were admitted during the study period, of which 604 were enrolled. IFD was diagnosed in 35 episodes (5.8%) of which 7 (1.2%) were proven, 10 (1.6%) probable, and 18 (3.0%) possible. Four variables obtained on day 4 were significantly more common in IFD cases, which were presence of fever, absolute neutrophil count < or =500/mm, AMC < or =100/mm, and CRP > or =90 mg/L. The combination of fever, AMC < or =100/mm, and CRP > or =90 at day 4 provided a RR for IFD of 5.4 (99% CI, 3.2-9.2) with a sensitivity of 75%, specificity of 87%, positive and negative predictive values of 13% and 99%, respectively.Fever persisting at day 4 of admission, together with AMC < or =100 and CRP > or =90 significantly increased the risk for IFD in children with cancer.",2010,20616763,no
Developing a vaccine against aspergillosis.,"Although there is considerable experimental data to support the idea, bringing a fungal vaccine to fruition has been elusive. Moreover, vaccinating the immunocompromised, susceptible to an opportunistic disease such as invasive aspergillosis, seems formidable. However, pioneering studies using Aspergillus particulate forms or homogenates, and recently, recombinant proteins, have demonstrated feasibility. Moreover, T cell receptors also recognize glycotopes if presented in the appropriate MHC-binding context. The potential role of induced antibody has been appreciated only recently. Recent studies in our laboratory with heat-killed Saccharomyces (HKY) have raised the possibility of development of a panfungal vaccine. This yeast may be nature's experimental reagent, to show the way to a protective protein-carbohydrate conjugate vaccine. Subcutaneous HKY is an effective vaccine against Aspergillus, Coccidioides or Candida challenge. We have learned the protective moiety is in the cell wall, and proteins, glucan and lipid all seem important. We have also found the cell wall glycans alone, mannan or glucan, as a vaccine each provide significant protection. This leads to consideration of the importance of glycosylated proteins and glycan polymer-protein conjugates in vaccine development. We think the most productive route to a fungal-specific vaccine may be a conjugate vaccine that combines the optimally configured glycan with a specific immunogenic protein. Our work so far suggests that some proteins may be sufficiently cross-immunogenic, such that combined with the appropriate glycan, it may be possible to develop a pan-fungal vaccine.",2012,20608783,no
Aspergillus endocarditis 2003-2009.,"A retrospective study of 35 case reports of Aspergillus endocarditis published between 2003 and 2009 was carried out. Fifteen percent of cases presented with a new cardiac murmur, 38% with an embolus. Eighty percent of cases involved the aortic or mitral valves. Seventy-four percent of cases involved patients with a history of prior surgery, 48% of these involved a heart valve, 20% had other cardiac surgery and 32% had non-cardiac surgery. Galactomannan testing was helpful diagnostically in four out of nine cases, but PCR testing was positive in six out of six cases. Overall mortality was 68%, all eight survivors had heart valve surgery apart from one - an 8-month-old child. Seven out of eight survivors received liposomal amphotericin B, three of these in combination with other antifungals. We need to think more about the possibility of Aspergillus endocarditis, particularly in immunocompromised patients with recent surgery. Galactomannan and PCR testing may be used more vigorously. Valve replacement, or at least vegetectomy, should be carried out in all patients. Liposomal amphotericin B, 3-5mg/kg/day, for at least 4 weeks is the treatment of choice. Oral voriconazole should be used for at least 2 years. Posaconazole may be an alternative, however there have been no prior cases reported to suggest its efficacy. The value of combination antifungal therapy is uncertain, but consideration should be given to the use of a second agent in addition to liposomal amphotericin. While further case reports on this condition will be helpful, more definitive management guidelines will depend on a prospective study.",2012,20608781,no
Determination of Aspergillus fumigatus allergen 1 in poultry farms using the enzyme immunoassay.,"Poultry farms contain high levels of allergenic fungi, and Aspergillus spp. is the most common genus of moulds. Aspergillus fumigatus antigens are responsible for the development of several respiratory diseases including asthma. The aim of this study was to measure the mass fraction of Asp f 1, a major allergen of Asperillus fumigatus in 37 indoor dust samples collected from four poultry farms in a rural area of the Zagreb County (Croatia) using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. More than 62 % of dust samples had detectable Asp f 1 levels (limit of detection 3.6 ng g(-1)). The overall mean Asp f 1 level was 17.9 ng g(-1) [range (3.8 to 72.4) ng g(-1)]. Satisfactory results were obtained for analytical within-run imprecision (6.7 %), between-run imprecision (10.5 %), and accuracy (91 % to 115 %). Microclimate parameters (air temperature, relative humidity, and velocity) were within the recommended ranges in all poultry farms. This study has shown that Asp f 1 settles on dust at poultry farms and that occupational exposure to this allergen deserves monitoring in livestock buildings.",2010,20587390,no
Comparative functional analysis of the OCH1 mannosyltransferase families in Aspergillus fumigatus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"Alpha1,6-linked mannans are an essential component of the Aspergillus fumigatus galactomannan, which is either GPI-anchored to the plasma membrane or covalently bound to the polysaccharide core of the cell wall. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the OCH1 gene encodes an alpha1,6-mannosyltransferase that initiates the synthesis of the alpha1,6 linked-mannan. In the A. fumigatus genome, four orthologous genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ScOCH1 gene were identified. Single deletion and the quadruple deletion mutants (Afoch1-4Delta) were constructed in A. fumigatus. No phenotype different from the wild-type strain was observed in all single and the quadruple mutants. The corresponding cDNAs of the AfOCH1-4 A. fumigatus orthologues were expressed in the S. cerevisiae Scoch1Delta mutant. Among the four orthologues, only AfOCH1 complemented the aggregation phenotype, the growth inhibition, the hypersensitivity to hygromycin and the protein glycosylation defects observed in the Scoch1Deltamutant.",2010,20586114,no
Analysis of the cellular Aspergillus fumigatus proteome that reacts with sera from rabbits developing an acquired immunity after experimental aspergillosis.,"Invasive aspergillosis caused by the mould Aspergillus fumigatus is a life-threatening lung or systemic infection in the immunocompromised host. In this study, a protective immune response against the disease was achieved in two infected rabbits, and the cellular fungal antigenic proteome that mediated such a response was investigated against the background of vaccine development efforts. Altogether, 59 different Aspergillus proteins were found becoming reactive in the course of the developing immunity, many of which are described in this context for the first time. These included proteins related to oxidative stress management, glycolysis and other metabolic pathways. As oxidative stress is suspected to be one of the major defense mechanisms, the results may indicate at least in part a continuous response of the pathogen to evade the host's immune system. In addition, proteins with suspected cell surface association or crucial function for fungal cell development were identified. As these antigens are newly recognized during the process of the developing immunoprotection, they may not only represent valuable infection markers but also importantly broaden the list of possible vaccine candidates.",2010,20564691,no
"[Investigation of West Nile virus in central nervous system infections of unknown etiology in Ankara, Turkey].","Arthropod-borne viral infections have recently gained considerable attention and importance as re-emerging infections in a global scale. West Nile Virus (WNV), a member of Flaviviridae, is an enveloped positive strand RNA virus that is usually transmitted to humans by the bite of Culicine mosquitoes. Although the majority of the human infections are asymptomatic, WNV may also cause febrile and neuro-invasive diseases. Seroprevalence data from Turkey indicate that WNV activity is present in Central Anatolia. In this study performed at Hacettepe University Hospital, paired serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 87 adult patients with the preliminary diagnosis of aseptic meningitis/encephalitis of unknown etiology were evaluated retrospectively to identify WNV-related syndromes. Bacterial, fungal and mycobacterial cultures yielded negative results and Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Herpes simplex virus nucleic acid tests were also negative for the selected patients. Commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)s and indirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT)s were employed for WNV IgM and IgG antibody detection (Anti-WNV Virus IgG/IgM ELISA, Anti-WNV Virus IgG/IgM IIFT Euroimmun, Germany). Additional ELISA/IIFT assays were further performed for WNV antibody reactive samples to identify cross-reactions and/or infections with other flaviviruses and phleboviruses. All WNV antibody positive samples were also evaluated by a WNV real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. WNV IgM and IgG antibodies were detected in %9.2 (8/87) and 3.4% (3/87) of the serum samples, respectively. All IgG reactive samples were negative for IgM. All sera with WNV antibody reactivity (n = 11) and the corresponding CSF samples were negative for viral RNA via RT-PCR. In 5 of the 8 WNV IgM positive subjects, sandfly fever virus IgM antibodies were detected, which was also accompanied by Dengue virus IgM positivity in one sample. In another case, intrathecal antibody synthesis against measles virus was demonstrated. Two cases (2/87",2011,20549960,no
Diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in lung transplant recipients by detection of galactomannan in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.,"Galactomannan (GM) detection in serum samples has been used to diagnose invasive aspergillosis (IA). Limited sensitivity has been observed in lung transplant recipients, for whom bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) testing has been advocated. Because airway colonization with Aspergillus species occurs frequently in these patients, false-positive GM results have been reported if the cutoff validated for sera is used (i.e., 0.5).Herein, we prospectively studied BAL fluid samples from 60 lung transplant patients to determine the optimal cutoff for BAL GM testing. Only one sample per patient was studied. BAL samples were vortexed and processed according to the manufacturer's instructions for serum samples. Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios were calculated in reference to proven or probable IA cases using receiver operating characteristic analysis.Eight patients had IA during the study (incidence 13.3%), including four patients with proven IA. Aspergillosis increased 5-fold the risk of death in lung transplant recipients. The positive predictive value of a positive BAL GM test at the 0.5 cutoff was low (24.2%). Raising the cutoff improved test specificity without compromising sensitivity. The best cutoff was defined at 1.5 (sensitivity 100% and specificity 90.4%).This study reinforces the importance of BAL GM testing in lung transplant recipients, particularly to exclude the diagnosis of IA. To minimize the frequency of false-positive results, a higher test cutoff should be applied to BAL samples, in comparison with serum samples.",2010,20548265,no
The utility of Coccidioides polymerase chain reaction testing in the clinical setting.,"Coccidioidomycosis, the fungal infection caused by dimorphic Coccidioides sp., is typically diagnosed by histopathologic identification of spherules in affected secretions and tissues or by culture. These tests are reliable but time-intensive, delaying diagnosis and treatment. To evaluate a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test developed to detect Coccidioides sp. in clinical specimens, we conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients (N = 145) who underwent Coccidioides PCR at our institution between April 27, 2007, and May 6, 2008, abstracting clinical, microbiologic, serologic, radiographic, treatment, and follow-up data. One hundred fifty-eight PCR tests (153 respiratory 5 cerebrospinal fluid) produced 5 positive and 153 negative findings. Five of nine patients (56%) with confirmed or highly probable pulmonary coccidioidomycosis had a positive PCR on respiratory specimens, and four of nine (44%) had a positive culture. Among two patients with coccidioidal meningitis, none had a positive PCR, whereas Coccidioides sp. in fungal culture grew for one of two. Among six asymptomatic patients with probable coccidioidomycosis, none had a positive culture or PCR. Compared with culture of respiratory specimens, PCR demonstrated a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 75, 99, 60, and 99%, respectively. Coccidioides PCR appears accurate in identifying negative results, and its sensitivity is similar to that of fungal culture.",2011,20535639,no
[Hepatic arterial infusion of liposomal amphotericin B for multiple fungal abscesses in the liver of a patient with chronic granulomatous disease].,"A 26-year-old man with chronic granulomatous disease complicated by multiple liver abscess was admitted to our hospital for hepatic resection and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from an HLA-matched sibling. We diagnosed the patient with Aspergillus liver abscesses based on computed tomographic findings, elevated serum levels of beta-D-glucan, positive test for galactomannan antigen, and the findings of laboratory cultures. Since the liver abscess could not be treated by drainage and administration of antifungals, we resected the posterior segments of the liver, which contained the abscess (S1, S6). However, abscess recurred in the remaining part of the liver 1 month later. The patient received allogeneic BMT from an HLA-matched sibling. During BMT, we continuously administered liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) via the hepatic artery (25 mg/day) to treat the liver abscess. There were no adverse effects during hepatic arterial infusion of L-AMB, and the liver abscess disappeared after BMT. These results suggest that hepatic arterial infusion of L-AMB is effective in treating fungal abscess in the liver.",2010,20534956,no
Invasive aspergillosis in pediatric patients.,"This case-based review examines the growing literature on critical issues related to the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of pediatric invasive aspergillosis. Immunocompromised children are at heightened risk for invasive aspergillosis. Children at highest risk include those with new-onset or relapsed hematologic malignancy and recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplants. Additional risk factors in stem cell transplant recipients include impaired lymphocyte engraftment and graft-versus-host disease. Pediatric invasive aspergillosis is associated with a high mortality rate (generally >50%) and requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent dissemination and death. Tools available for diagnosis include radiologic examinations (primarily computed tomography), the galactomannan assay, bronchoalveolar lavage, and tissue biopsy. Age-related differences in computed tomography and galactomannan assay results have been suggested. Recommended primary therapy for pediatric invasive aspergillosis is voriconazole (7 mg/kg IV q12 hours). Currently approved alternative therapies include liposomal amphotericin B, amphotericin B lipid complex, and caspofungin. Posaconazole and itraconazole are also possibilities, but there is no established pediatric dose for posaconazole, and itraconazole dosing is difficult in children. In patients who do not benefit from initial antifungal therapy, options include switching to another agent with a different mechanism of action or combination therapy. Further research is required to better establish optimal approaches to the management of pediatric patients with invasive aspergillosis recalcitrant to initial primary therapy.",2010,20513209,no
High incidence of false-positive Aspergillus galactomannan test in multiple myeloma.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) remains one of the most significant causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with hematological malignancies undergoing chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), mainly due to the difficulty in its early diagnosis. Monitoring of galactomannan (GM) antigen, an exoantigen of Aspergillus, in the blood by sandwich ELISA is a useful and noninvasive method for early diagnosis of IA. The GM test has a sensitivity of 67-100% with a specificity of 81-99% in neutropenic patients and allogeneic transplant recipients [1-3]. Although it has been widely used as a diagnostic criterion for IA [4,5], one of the major limitations of this assay is false-positivity, particularly in pediatric patients [1], patients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) [6,7], and those taking dietary GM [8,9] or fungus-derived antibiotics, such as piperacillin-tazobactam (PIPC/TAZ) [10-12].",2010,20513124,no
"Difficulties in using 1,3-{beta}-D-glucan as the screening test for the early diagnosis of invasive fungal infections in patients with haematological malignancies--high frequency of false-positive results and their analysis.","We have evaluated the contribution of the 1,3-beta-d-glucan (BG) assay for the screening of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) in patients with haematological malignancies. Serum samples from patients at risk of IFI were collected twice a week and retrospectively tested using the BG assay. BG screening was performed on 1143 samples from 91 patients during 104 anticancer treatment cycles. Proven and probable cases of IFI occurred in 9 (8.7 %) treatment cycles. Depending on the criterion of positivity used (1x >60 pg ml(-1), 1x >80 pg ml(-1), 2x >60 pg ml(-1) or 2x >80 pg ml(-1)) the sensitivity and specificity were 89, 89, 67 and 44 %, and 20, 48, 33 and 56 %, respectively. Although the test was marked as positive in 82, 68, 54 and 45 % of all the treatment cycles, in the majority of cases, these positivities were probably false. The major limit of the BG test was an extremely low positive predictive value (10 to 12 %). We have analysed mucositis, candida colonization, bacteraemia, use of antimicrobials, erythrocyte and thrombocyte filtered blood products, collecting tubes or sampling via venous catheters. Even though no factor is a major source of BG, it could at least partially influence BG assay performance. Thus, BG detection has a limited usefulness as a screening method for IFIs in patients with haematological malignancies.",2010,20488937,no
[Mycoserology--did we move on? Aspergillus].,"Diseases caused by Aspergillus spp. are difficult to diagnose and thus require supplementary serological assays. This is the result of a selective review of the relevant literature with special regard to recent guidelines. In addition to conventional diagnostic tools (radiology, microscopy, culture) the measurement of the following serological markers is recommended, depending on the clinical type of aspergillosis: Invasive and chronic necrotising aspergillosis: Aspergillus-galactomannan antigen. Test format: EIA using the rat MAb EB-A2. Cut-off 0.5 (index). Monitoring of high risk patients: Twice weekly. Aspergillus-IgG (test format EIA) as confirmatory assay after recovery of the leukocyte function under therapy. Aspergilloma: Aspergillus IgG. Test format: EIA. Allergical aspergillosis: Aspergillus IgE. Test format: RAST. Galactomannan antigen detection rates high in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.

Accuracy of BAL galactomannan in diagnosing invasive aspergillosis: a bivariate metaanalysis and systematic review.,"A serum galactomannan (GM) assay has been approved for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis (IA). However, the role of the BAL-GM assay has not been well established. Therefore, we conducted a metaanalysis to determine the overall accuracy of BAL-GM in the diagnosis of IA.After a systematic review of English-language studies, the sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), and positive and negative likelihood ratios (PLR and NLR, respectively) of BAL-GM for the diagnosis of IA were pooled using a bivariate metaanalysis. Hierarchic summary receiver operating characteristic curves were used to summarize overall test performance. Potential between-study heterogeneity was explored by subgroup analyses. We calculated posttest probability to evaluate clinical usefulness.Twelve reports, including 13 studies, met our inclusion criteria. The summary estimates of the BAL-GM assay for proven or probable IA were as follows: SEN, 0.90 (95% CI, 0.79-0.96) SPE, 0.94 (95% CI, 0.90-0.96)BAL-GM determination is a sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of proven and probable IA. The measurement of BAL-GM is thus likely to be a useful tool for diagnosing IA. Further studies focused on the impact of treatment agents are needed.",2010,20453070,no
"Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of amphotericin B deoxycholate, liposomal amphotericin B, and amphotericin B lipid complex in an in vitro model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.","The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic (PK-PD) properties of amphotericin B (AmB) formulations against invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) are not well understood. We used an in vitro model of IPA to further elucidate the PK-PD of amphotericin B deoxycholate (DAmB), liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB) and amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC). The pharmacokinetics of these formulations for endovascular fluid, endothelial cells, and alveolar cells were estimated. Pharmacodynamic relationships were defined by measuring concentrations of galactomannan in endovascular and alveolar compartments. Confocal microscopy was used to visualize fungal biomass. A mathematical model was used to calculate the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in each compartment and estimate the extent of drug penetration. The interaction of LAmB with host cells and hyphae was visualized using sulforhodamine B-labeled liposomes. The MICs for the pure compound and the three formulations were comparable (0.125 to 0.25 mg/liter). For all formulations, concentrations of AmB progressively declined in the endovascular fluid as the drug distributed into the cellular bilayer. Depending on the formulation, the AUCs for AmB were 10 to 300 times higher within the cells than within endovascular fluid. The concentrations producing a 50% maximal effect (EC50) in the endovascular compartment were 0.12, 1.03, and 4.41 mg/liter for DAmB, LAmB, and ABLC, respectively, whereas, the EC50 in the alveolar compartment were 0.17, 7.76, and 39.34 mg/liter, respectively. Confocal microscopy suggested that liposomes interacted directly with hyphae and host cells. The PK-PD relationships of the three most widely used formulations of AmB differ markedly within an in vitro lung model of IPA.",2010,20439615,no
Fungal infections after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,"Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Despite that epidemiology of IFIs has changed notably by evolution in transplantation procedures as well as preventative strategies, the attributable mortality still remains high, mainly because of delayed initiation of treatment due to its diagnostic difficulty. Hence high-resolution computed tomography and non-culture based adjunctive diagnostic tests such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for galactomannan and (1,3)-beta-D: -glucan have been incorporated into clinical practice, and global antifungal prophylaxis has been applied particularly to high-risk patients. Newer mold-active agents with higher efficacy and lower toxicity are currently being introduced as prophylaxis, and the combination of these agents are being evaluated as salvage therapy. This review summarizes recent advances in the diagnosis and management of IFIs in HSCT recipients. Further improvement of clinical outcome will be achieved by optimizing diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic approach based on individual patient's risk and situation.",2010,20432074,no
Ochratoxin A production in aniseed-based media by selected fungal strains and in anise fruits (Pimpinella anisum L.).,"The growth conditions and ochratoxin A (OTA) production of Aspergillus strains were studied in aniseed (Pimpinella anisum L.)-based media. The results showed that methanol/NaHCO3 (50:50, v/v) mixture for extraction and competitive direct ELISA analytical method are capable of detecting low OTA concentrations in this raw material, which were confirmed by HPLC with fluorescence detection (R (2) = 0.994). In aniseed meal extract agar artificially contaminated with selected fungi, the higher OTA values obtained were 283.8 ± 28.1 μg L(-1) for A. carbonarius and between 1.7 ± 0.1 μg L(-1) and 16.5 ± 12.8 μg L(-1) for A. steynii strains. While the optimal conditions of growth for A. carbonarius and A. steynii are 28°C and 0.98 a w, the optimal production of OTA was observed at 0.99 a w for both A. carbonarius and A. steynii but at 22°C and 28°C, respectively. Except in one sample, all the aniseed samples analysed were negative for OTA natural contamination. This study demonstrates that aniseed can be a matrix capable to contamination with OTA, at least produced by A. carbonarius and A. steynii strains, regardless of the antimicrobial properties of aniseed essential oil.",2010,23605311,no

Galactomannan detection from piperacillin-tazobactam brands available in the Brazilian market.,"Piperacillin-tazobactam is a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent that can cause false-positive results in the commercial Platelia Aspergillus EIA test. So far, no study has been performed in Latin America to evaluate the clinical implication of this finding. Here we studied the potential for galactomannan detection in piperacillin-tazobactam batches commercialized in the Brazilian market. Five batches from distinct laboratories were tested in duplicate in the Platelia Aspergillus EIA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Only one drug showed crossreaction at a cut-off of 0.5. Human serum was spiked with this particular drug aiming to mimic achievable piperacillin-tazobactam concentrations in the serum. Results were all negative for galactomannan detection, even at high drug concentrations. Results from this pilot study suggest that piperacillin-tazobactam might not be a clinically significant cause of false-positive results in the Platelia Aspergillus EIA test in Brazil.",2010,20428634,no
Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the diagnostic value of combined serological tests.,"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is increasing in frequency. We conducted this study to find out the approximate incidence of IPA in patients with acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD), and to determine whether using a combination of two tests (galactomannan [GM] antigen and 1,3-beta-glucan [BG] detection) would result in a more specific diagnosis of IPA.The study included 261 patients with AECOPD admitted over two years. The patients were categorized according to the modified definitions for IPA. GM antigen and BG were detected by the Platelia Aspergillus and Glucatell tests.Two patients had proven IPA, three had probable IPA, and two had possible IPA. The rate of proven or probable IPA in patients with AECOPD was 1.91% (5/261). Four patients with proven and probable IPA had been treated with a systemic or inhaled corticosteroid before hospitalization and the typical symptoms and diagnostic signs of IPA were relatively less common in them. Mortality in patients with proven and probable IPA was 80%. The specificity of combined GM and BG detection was 98.8%.Combining two serological tests increased the specificity of diagnosis but further trials are needed to prove the value of this approach.",2011,20427934,no
[Hematological unit invasive aspergillosis epidemiology].,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among the immunocompromised, especially those undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. With spore inhalation the usual infection route, such subjects must be protected from environmental spore contamination, necessitating measures such as high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration. In April 2006, we implemented a new transplantation unit with HEPA filtration. We retrospectively evaluated its efficacy for hospitalized transplantation unit subjects whose sera were tested for aspergillus galactomannan antigen between April 2004 and March 2007. Subjects numbered 265 (973 samples) categorized as definite, probable, or possible. The earliest IA onset date was when symptoms, positive radiological findings, or positive galactomannan antigen tests occurred, based on revised European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) definitions. We classified cases when IA occurred over 10 days after admission as hospital-acquired. No such cases were detected after November 2005 and IA incidence decreased significantly after the new unit began being used.

False-positive Aspergillus real-time PCR assay due to a nutritional supplement in a bone marrow transplant recipient with GVH disease.,"PCR screening for circulating DNA, especially when combined with antigen testing, has shown promise for the definitive diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. False positives for Aspergillus real-time PCR assays have been described in several reports, but no sources of fungal DNA contamination could be clearly identified. We report a false-positive case for both galactomannan (GM) antigenemia and Aspergillus PCR due to nutritional supplement intake in a bone marrow transplant recipient with digestive graft-versus-host disease. Our case report also suggests that fungal DNA can pass into the serum from the intestinal tract in the same way as fungal GM. Clinicians should be aware of this possibility, so that the administration of costly, unnecessary antifungal treatments with potential adverse side-effects can be avoided.",2010,20392146,no
Aspergillus PCR testing: results from a prospective PCR study within the AmBiLoad trial.,"Invasive fungal infection (IFI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in severely immunocompromised patients and is difficult to diagnose. The significance of molecular methods for diagnosis of IFI is still controversial. In a subset of patients treated within the AmBiLoad Trial, samples were investigated prospectively by a nested Aspergillus PCR assay to re-evaluate the significance of PCR in this setting.In the randomized, prospective multicenter AmBiLoad trial, patients with proven or probable IFI were randomized to receive liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) 3 or 10 mg/kg QD for 14 d followed by L-AMB 3 mg/kg QD. From 91 patients, 459 serial samples (98% blood samples) were investigated by a nested PCR assay for Aspergillus DNA. All samples were investigated in our laboratory with a previously described nested and a quantitative PCR assay. As required by the study protocol, serial Aspergillus antigen galactomannan was performed. IFI was defined according to modified EORTC/MSG 2002 criteria as applied in the AmBiLoad trial.Seven and 52 patients had proven and probable IFI according to modified EORTC/MSG criteria, respectively. The median number of samples investigated per patient was 4. Seventy percent of samples were obtained during treatment with antifungal study medication. Forty-three samples gave positive PCR results. Patients with an unfavorable outcome had a significantly higher rate of positive PCR results (48% versus 21%).The sensitivity of Aspergillus PCR testing is limited during antifungal therapy.

"[Utility of galactomannan enzyme immunoassay and (1,3)beta-D-glucan assay in invasive fungal infection].","To evaluate the performance of the galactomannan enzyme immunoassay (GM test) and (1,3)beta-D-glucan assay (G test) for the diagnosis of invasive fungal infection (IFI).A retrospective study was performed in 115 hospitalized patients at Peking University First Hospital who were at risk of IFI. Patients were diagnosed as IFI according to revised definitions of invasive fungal disease from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) Consensus Group. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated at different cutoff values for two assays respectively. Two tests were combined to evaluate the changes of sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV.The best sensitivity (54.5%, 63.6%) and specificity (77.9%, 69.2%) were obtained with the cutoff values of 0.5 and 20 x 10(3) pg/L in GM test and G test respectively. The PPV were 20.7% and 17.9%, and the NPV were 94.2% and 94.7% respectively.

Repeated rhinoscopic and serologic assessment of the effectiveness of intranasally administered clotrimazole for the treatment of nasal aspergillosis in dogs.,"To determine the role of rhinoscopic evaluation and repeated serologic testing in assessing the success rate of intranasally administered clotrimazole for treatment of dogs with nasal aspergillosis.Prospective case series.23 dogs with nasal aspergillosis.Dogs with nasal aspergillosis were treated with an intranasal infusion of 1% clotrimazole solution. Response to treatment was assessed with repeated rhinoscopic evaluation, with histologic examination and fungal culture when available. Results of repeated serologic testing for aspergillosis were monitored throughout the treatment course.11 of the 23 (48%) dogs had no rhinoscopic evidence of disease after the first treatment. Three of 7 dogs were free of disease after the second treatment, and 1 of 3 dogs was free after the third treatment. Presence or absence of nasal discharge and results of repeated serologic testing were not consistent with disease status. Overall, the efficacy of intranasally administered clotrimazole for treatment of nasal aspergillosis could be confirmed in 15 of 17 dogs. Delayed recurrence or reinfection was confirmed in 3 of 15 dogs. When recurrences were taken into account, the success rate was 67% (12/15 dogs).Clinical signs were not predictive of disease state, and follow-up rhinoscopy is recommended to assess response to treatment. The success rate of intranasally administered clotrimazole was similar to rates in previous reports however, the number of dogs with recurrent disease was relatively high. Monitoring of the results of serologic testing is not recommended for use in determining response to treatment.",2010,20367042,no
Impact of bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan on the outcome of patients at risk for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.,"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised patients especially in neutropenic and patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs. New diagnostic tools have been developed to improve treatment and outcome. Compared with serum galactomannan, bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan (BAL GM) detection has higher sensitivity (81% vs. 71%) and comparable specificity (87.6% vs. 89%). No study has correlated this test result to clinical outcome.A prospective non-randomised study was conducted from March to December 2008 in adult patients who were suspected to have invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). Serum galactomannan levels were measured and bronchoscopy was performed to obtained BAL fluid for direct examination, culture, and measurement of galactomannan level. Response to treatment and mortality within 6-weeks of follow-up were compared between positive and negative BAL GM groups. Factors influencing outcome were also analysed.There were 30 patients with 3 probable, 11 possible and 17 no IPA. Other causative organisms can be identified in 8 of 17 patients in the no IPA group. Overall, BAL GM at the 0.5 cut-off yielded a 46% positive result compared with 13% of serum GM (p = 0.005). There was no significant difference in positive result between BAL GM at 1.0 cut-off and serum GM. By using BAL GM as a mycological criteria, 54% of possible IPA was upgraded to probable IPA. Neither BAL GM nor serum GM results were associated with clinical response and mortality. Recovery of neutropenia was the only factor associated with response to treatment and outcome (p = 0.003).BAL GM detection has a higher positive rate than serum GM in patients at risk for IPA. It is helpful in diagnosis and categorization of IPA, but its impact on clinical outcome cannot be demonstrated in this study.",2010,20364562,no
Detection of invasive aspergillosis.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) caused by the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus is a frequent and life-threatening complication of chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation with high rates of mortality and morbidity. Diagnosis of IA is complex and can only be confirmed by identification of the fungus in biopsy samples. Capturing tissue for diagnosis is in itself hazardous, and because of this many patients receive empirical antifungal treatment rather than undergo biopsy. However, the treatment carries with it significant side effects and is prohibitively expensive. Because of this, attempts have been made to develop specific and sensitive diagnostic tests that can be used to track the early onset of infection and permit rational administration of antifungal drugs. Early attempts at nonculture-based diagnosis using human immune serum to detect circulating Aspergillus antigens proved unreliable, and so focus turned to hybridoma technology and the use of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to detect signature molecules of infection. Detection of one such signature molecule, galactomannan (and associated galactomannoprotein molecules), forms the basis of the commercial Platelia enzyme immunoassay (EIA), an assay that has found widespread use in IA diagnosis. Nevertheless, concerns surrounding its accuracy mean that alternative strategies to diagnosis have been sought including detection of the fungal cell wall component (1-->3)-beta-d-glucan and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The poor specificity of ""panfungal"" (1-->3)-beta-d-glucan tests and current lack of standardization of PCR assays have led to the recent development of next-generation MAb-based assays that detect surrogate markers of infection and that have been incorporated into ""point-of-care"" diagnostic devices. This chapter examines the development of antibody-antigen, (1-->3)-beta-d-glucan, and nucleic acid-based approaches to IA detection, current concerns surrounding accurate disease diagnosis, and how animal models of infection can be used to inform assay development and validation.",2010,20359458,no
Early mannan detection in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid with preemptive treatment reduces the incidence of invasive Candida infections in preterm infants.,"Candida colonization is an important predictor for development of invasive fungal infection (IFI). We investigated whether early detection of Candida mannan (Mn) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) reduces IFI among preterm infants.We conducted an observational study of infants with gestational age of < or =28 weeks, where a group undergoing Candida surveillance cultures (pre-Mn detection group) was compared with a group defined after the initiation of routine use of Candida Mn detection in BALF (Mn detection group). Antifungal treatment was started based on positive microbiologic (surveillance culture or Mn-antigen assay) results.No significant differences were detected when the groups were compared for several predictors of IFI. IFI was observed for 12 (23%) of 51 infants in the pre-Mn detection group, and for 0 (0%) of 29 infants in the Mn detection group (P = 0.003). Surveillance cultures in the pre-Mn detection group became positive at 15.0 +/- 7.2 days after birth, whereas the mean age at time of positive Mn antigen results in the Mn detection group was 4.3 +/- 3.1 days (P < 0.0001). Among 16 infants positive for surveillance cultures, 12 (75%) developed IFI (P < 0.0001).This study suggests that Candida Mn detection in BALF may be useful for earlier identification and preemptive therapy targeting preterm infants at high risk of IFI.",2010,20357693,no

Serum samples were obtained both before and after antibiotic infusion on the first, third, seventh and tenth days of a piperacillin/tazobactam treatment course and 4 days after the last dose. GM was determined by Platelia Aspergillus ELISA (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and BDG was assayed using the Fungitell kit (Associates of Cape Cod, East Falmouth, MA) according to manufacturers' specifications.A total of 135 serum samples were collected from 15 patients. When a cut-off level of >or=0.7 was used for GM positivity, there were no false positive results. When a cut-off level of >or=0.5 was used, six serum samples were positive. There were no statistically significant differences between the median GM indices or median BDG levels of the various sampling times. However, 24 of 135 serum samples were positive for BDG for a threshold of 80 pg/mL. After ruling out fungal infections and all known potential causes of false BDG positivity, environmental contamination remained a possible cause of BDG reactivity.No significant interaction was observed between piperacillin/tazobactam administration and Aspergillus GM and BDG assays.

The role of biopsy in the diagnosis of infections of the central nervous system.,"CNS infections require prompt appropriate therapy, but do not usually require tissue biopsy for diagnosis. We performed a 5 year audit of CNS infections which required brain or spinal biopsy to determine or confirm a diagnosis of CNS infection. Sixteen cases were identified in which clinical, radiological or additional investigations including culture, serology or PCR for the suspected specific infective agents were not diagnostic. 6 (37.5%) were bacterial abscesses presenting as space-occupying intracerebral lesions with a differential diagnosis of neoplasm. There were 3 (18.7%) cases of toxoplasmosis and 2 (12.5%) cases of aspergillosis. There was one case (6.2%) of herpes simplex encephalitis, one cysticercosis and one progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy, all biopsied as possible neoplasms. There were 2 (12.5%) cases of spinal tuberculosis, one multifocal, mimicking neurofibromatosis. This review highlights the usefulness of targeted biopsy in the rapid diagnosis of CNS infections.

Chapter 8: Fungal infections in immunocompromised patients.,"Pulmonary complications are the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients, who lack of the basic mechanisms of cellular defense. Regardless of the cause of the immunodeficiency, the most common complications are infections (bacterial, viral or fungal). Among the fungal infections, aspergillosis is the most common (incidence, 1-9% mortality, 55-92%) following organ transplant. Although pulmonary involvement is the most common form of aspergillosis, central nervous system involvement and sinusitis are not uncommon. On CT scans, the halo sign represents an area of low attenuation around the nodule, revealing edema or hemorrhage. The gold standard for the diagnosis is the culture identification of the fungus in sputum, BAL fluid or biopsy samples. Failing this identification, the detection of galactomannan, which is one of the fungal wall components, has shown sensitivity and specificity of 89% and 98%, respectively. Amphotericin B, liposomal amphotericin B, caspofungin and, especially, voriconazole are effective against the fungus. Although Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia can be fatal, the incidence of this disease has decreased due to the prophylactic use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. In immunocompromised patients presenting with dyspnea and hypoxemia, screening for fungi is indicated.

Galactomannan testing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is useful for diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in hematology patients.,"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hematological malignancies in the setting of profound neutropenia and/or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Early diagnosis and therapy has been shown to improve outcomes, but reaching a definitive diagnosis quickly can be problematic. Recently, galactomannan testing of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid has been investigated as a diagnostic test for IPA, but widespread experience and consensus on optical density (OD) cut-offs remain lacking.We performed a prospective case-control study to determine an optimal BAL galactomannan OD cutoff for IPA in at-risk patients with hematological diagnoses. Cases were subjects with hematological diagnoses who met established definitions for proven or probable IPA. There were two control groups: subjects with hematological diagnoses who did not meet definitions for proven or probable IPA and subjects with non-hematological diagnoses who had no evidence of aspergillosis. Following bronchoscopy and BAL, galactomannan testing was performed using the Platelia Aspergillus seroassay in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.There were 10 cases and 52 controls. Cases had higher BAL fluid galactomannan OD indices (median 4.1, range 1.1-7.7) compared with controls (median 0.3, range 0.1-1.1). ROC analysis demonstrated an optimum OD index cutoff of 1.1, with high specificity (98.1%) and sensitivity (100%) for diagnosing IPA.Our results also support BAL galactomannan testing as a reasonably safe test with higher sensitivity compared to serum galactomannan testing in at-risk patients with hematological diseases. A higher OD cutoff is necessary to avoid over-diagnosis of IPA, and a standardized method of collection should be established before results can be compared between centers.",2010,20199673,no
False-positive serum and bronchoalveolar lavage Aspergillus galactomannan assays caused by different antibiotics.,"Our objective was to identify false-positive serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid galactomannan (GM) tests caused by various antibiotics commonly used in general practice. Serum and BAL samples from patients who did not have the diagnostic criteria of invasive aspergillosis and received different antibiotics were prospectively analyzed for GM. Serum and BAL samples were also collected from patients who did not receive antibiotics. At the cut-off index of >or=0.5, false-positive serum results were found in patients who received amoxicillin-clavulanate, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, and cefoperazone-sulbactam (26.7%, 58.3%, 14.3%, and 66.7%, respectively). Fungal colonization in BAL samples had a higher BAL GM than those without fungal colonization. In 71 patients who had a negative BAL culture for fungi, at the cut-off value of >or=1.0, false-positive BAL fluid results were found in patients who received amoxicillin-clavulanate (27.3%), piperacillin-tazobactam (50%), cefepime (16.7%), carbapenem (45.5%), and ceftriaxone (45.5%). False-positive serum and BAL GM assays were also detected in patients who did not receive any antibiotics. In summary, this study demonstrates the false-positive GM levels in serum and BAL caused by beta-lactam antibiotics that are commonly used in general practice. Physicians should be aware of this possible interference.",2010,20192889,no
Healthy human T-Cell Responses to Aspergillus fumigatus antigens.,"Aspergillus fumigatus is associated with both invasive and allergic pulmonary diseases, in different hosts. The organism is inhaled as a spore, which, if not cleared from the airway, germinates into hyphal morphotypes that are responsible for tissue invasion and resultant inflammation. Hyphae secrete multiple products that function as antigens, evoking both a protective (T(H)1-T(H)17) and destructive allergic (T(H)2) immunity. How Aspergillus allergens (Asp f proteins) participate in the development of allergic sensitization is unknown.To determine whether Asp f proteins are strictly associated with T(H)2 responses, or represent soluble hyphal products recognized by healthy hosts, human T cell responses to crude and recombinant products were characterized by ELISPOT. While responses (number of spots producing IFN-gamma, IL-4 or IL-17) to crude hyphal antigen preparations were weak, responses to recombinant Asp f proteins were higher. Recombinant allergens stimulated cells to produce IFN-gamma more so than IL-4 or IL-17. Volunteers exhibited a diverse CD4+ and CD8+ T cell antigen recognition profile, with prominent CD4 T(H)1-responses to Asp f3 (a putative peroxismal membrane protein), Asp f9/16 (cell wall glucanase), Asp f11 (cyclophilin type peptidyl-prolyl isomerase) and Asp f22 (enolase). Strong IFN-gamma responses were reproduced in most subjects tested over 6 month intervals.Products secreted after conidial germination into hyphae are differentially recognized by protective T cells in healthy, non-atopic individuals. Defining the specificity of the human T cell repertoire, and identifying factors that govern early responses may allow for development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics for both invasive and allergic Aspergillus diseases.",2010,20174463,no
Prophylactic and Therapeutic Potential of Asp f1 Epitopes in Naïve and Sensitized BALB/c Mice.,"The present study examines a hypothesis that short allergen-derived peptides may shift an Aspergillus fumigatus (Afu-) specific TH2 response towards a protective TH1. Five overlapping peptides (P1-P5) derived from Asp f1, a major allergen/antigen of Afu, were evaluated for prophylactic or therapeutic efficacy in BALB/c mice.To evaluate the prophylactic efficacy, peptides were intranasally administered to naïve mice and challenged with Afu-allergens/antigens. For evaluation of therapeutic efficacy, the mice were sensitized with Afu-allergens/antigens followed by intranasal administration of peptides. The groups were compared for the levels of Afu-specific antibodies in sera and splenic cytokines evaluated by ELISA. Eosinophil peroxidase activity was examined in the lung cell suspensions and lung inflammation was assessed by histopathogy.Peptides P1-, P2- and P3 decreased Afu-specific IgE (84.5~98.9%) and IgG antibodies (45.7~71.6%) in comparison with Afu-sensitized mice prophylactically. P1- and P2-treated ABPA mice showed decline in Afu-specific IgE (76.4~88%) and IgG antibodies (15~54%). Increased IgG2a/IgG1 and IFN-gamma/IL-4 ratios were observed. P1-P3 prophylactically and P1 therapeutically decreased IL-5 levels and eosinophil peroxidase activity. P1 decreased inflammatory cells' infiltration in lung tissue comparable to non-challenged control.Asp f1-derived peptide P1, prophylactically and therapeutically administered to Balb/c mice, is effective in regulating allergic response to allergens/antigens of Afu, and may be explored for immunotherapy of allergic aspergillosis in humans.",2010,20157606,no
Performance of the galactomannan antigen detection test in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in children with cancer or undergoing haemopoietic stem cell transplantation.,"Serum galactomannan (GM) antigen detection is not recommended for defining invasive aspergillosis (IA) in children undergoing aggressive chemotherapy or allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The ability of the GM test to identify IA in children was retrospectively evaluated in a cohort of children. Test performance was evaluated on samples that were collected during 195 periods at risk of IA. Proven IA was diagnosed in seven periods, all with positive GM test results (true positives, 4%), and possible IA was diagnosed in 15 periods, all with negative GM test results (false negatives, 8%). The test result was positive with negative microbiological, histological and clinical features in three periods (false positives, 1%), and in 170 periods it was negative with negative microbiological, histological and clinical features (true negatives, 87%). The sensitivity was 0.32 and the specificity was 0.98 the positive predictive value was 0.70 and the negative predictive value was 0.92. The efficiency of the test was 0.91, the positive likelihood ratio was 18.3, and the negative likelihood ratio was 1.4. The probability of missing an IA because of a negative test result was 0.03. Test performance proved to be better during at-risk periods following chemotherapy than in periods following allogeneic HSCT. The GM assay is useful for identifying periods of IA in children undergoing aggressive chemotherapy or allogeneic HSCT.",2010,20156215,no
Distinct melanization pathways in the mosquito Aedes aegypti.,"Serine protease cascades are involved in blood coagulation and immunity. In arthropods, they regulate melanization, which plays an important role in immune defense and wound healing. However, the mechanisms underlying melanization pathways are not completely characterized. We found that in the mosquito Aedes aegypti, there are two distinct melanization activation pathways carried out by different modules of serine proteases and their specific inhibitors serpins. Immune melanization proteases (IMP-1 and IMP-2) and Serpin-1 mediate hemolymph prophenoloxidase cleavage and immune response against the malaria parasite. Tissue melanization, exemplified by the formation of melanotic tumors, is controlled by tissue melanization protease (CLIPB8), IMP-1, and Serpin-2. In addition, serine proteases CLIPB5 and CLIPB29 are involved in activation of Toll pathway by fungal infection or by infection-independent manner, respectively. Serpin-2 is implicated in the latter activation of Toll pathway. This study revealed the complexity underlying melanization and Toll pathway in mosquitoes.",2010,20152169,no
Asperfuranone from Aspergillus nidulans inhibits proliferation of human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells via blocking cell cycle progression and inducing apoptosis.,"Asperfuranone, a novel compound of genomic mining in Aspergillus nidulans, was investigated for its anti-proliferative activity in human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells. To identity the anti-cancer mechanism of asperfuranone, we assayed its effect on apoptosis, cell cycle distribution, and levels of p53, p21 Waf1/Cip1, Fas/APO-1 receptor and Fas ligand. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that the G0/G1 phase arrest might be due to p53-dependent induction of p21 Waf1/Cip1. An enhancement in Fas/APO-1 and its two form ligands, membrane-bound Fas ligand (mFasL) and soluble Fas ligand (sFasL), might be responsible for the apoptotic effect induced by asperfuranone. Our study reports here for the first time that the induction of p53 and the activity of Fas/Fas ligand apoptotic system may participate in the anti-proliferative activity of asperfuranone in A549 cells.",2010,20148857,no
Prognostic features of galactomannan antigenemia in galactomannan-positive invasive aspergillosis.,"Prognostic features of serum galactomannan (GM) remain poorly defined in patients with GM-positive invasive aspergillosis (GPA). We identified 93 patients with proven or probable invasive aspergillosis (IA) and GM values of >or=0.50 from January 2005 to March 2009. We used Cox modeling of time to 6- and 12-week mortality for the GM level at the time of diagnosis (GM(0)), GM decay in the week following diagnosis in 72 patients with >or=2 GM values, other predictors of mortality, and antifungal use during the week following diagnosis. Six-week mortality was 55% in the whole cohort and 43% in patients with >or=2 GM determinations. The hazard ratio (HR) of GM(0) per unit increase and 1-week GM decay per unit decline per week were 1.25 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 1.54 P = 0.04) and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.63 to 0.96",2010,20147646,no
Cutaneous model of invasive aspergillosis.,"Cutaneous models have proven useful in studies of the pathogenesis and treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections. Because cutaneous invasive aspergillosis (IA) occurs in the clinical setting, we sought to develop a nonlethal murine cutaneous model of IA. We induced cutaneous IA in cyclophosphamide-treated nude BALB/c mice by subcutaneous injection of Aspergillus fumigatus conidia. Skin lesion areas correlated well with tissue fungal burdens, allowing dynamic visual monitoring of cutaneous infections. The cutaneous model accurately reflected alterations in A. fumigatus pathogenicity resulting from deletions of recognized virulence genes (pabaA, sidA, and pksP). Moreover, analysis of the roles of conidial and mycelial catalases revealed that the former is required for the initiation of cutaneous aspergillosis, whereas the latter contributes to its propagation. Finally, posaconazole treatment reduced skin lesion areas relative to those of untreated and fluconazole-treated controls. This novel cutaneous model system should be applicable to comparative studies of the pathogenesis, treatment, and tissue specificity of IA.",2010,20145078,no
Release of interleukins 6 and 8 induced by zymosan and mediated by MAP kinase and NF-kappaB signaling pathways in human corneal fibroblasts.,"Zymosan is derived from the cell wall of yeast and induces immune responses associated with fungal infection. The effects of zymosan on the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules and on the activity of signaling pathways were examined in cultured human corneal fibroblasts.Release of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, and IL-12 and of the chemokines IL-8, IP-10, and RANTES was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) was evaluated by immunoblot and immunofluorescence analyses. Phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the NF-kappaB inhibitory protein IkappaB-alpha was assessed by immunoblot analysis. Subcellular localization of the p65 subunit of the transcription factor NF-kappaB was determined by immunofluorescence analysis.Zymosan induced the release of IL-6 and IL-8 from corneal fibroblasts without affecting either the release of IL-1beta, IL-12, IP-10, or RANTES or the expression of ICAM-1 or VCAM-1. Zymosan also activated the MAPKs ERK, p38, and JNK and induced the phosphorylation of IkappaB-alpha and the nuclear translocation of p65 in these cells. The zymosan-induced release of IL-6 and IL-8 was attenuated by inhibitors of ERK, p38, JNK, and NF-kappaB signaling.Zymosan induces the release of IL-6 and IL-8 from human corneal fibroblasts in a manner dependent on MAPK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. Corneal fibroblasts may thus modulate the local immune response to fungal infection in the corneal stroma.",2010,20107167,no
Serosurvey and diagnostic application of antibody titers to Aspergillus in avian species.,"A multiyear study was conducted using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure antibody to address the application of the test to the diagnosis of aspergillosis in avian species. In general serostudies (n=1314), four avian groups (psittaciform, raptor, penguin, and zoo) were found to have samples with antibody reactivity. Penguin, raptor, and zoo groups were found to have higher levels of antibody to Aspergillus than the psittaciform group. Additional clinical information was collected on 303 cases, which resulted in the definition of presumptive normal, probable, and confirmed infection groups. Although the confirmed group was more likely to have antibody reactivity, the mean antibody index was not found to be significant between presumptive normal and probable or confirmed cases.",2010,20095147,no
Galactomannan on the stage: prospective evaluation of the  applicability in routine practice and surveillance.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) presents a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma for the physicians who take care of the patients with severe underlying diseases and immunosuppression. This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of serum galactomannan (GM) measurements in the routine practice and surveillance of IA along with possible caveats in diagnosis and treatment. Adult patients with high-risk haematological malignancies admitted to the Internal Medicine wards during the 2-year study period were followed up by daily visits for vital signs, existing or newly developing signs and symptoms, clinical and laboratory findings. Blood samples were analysed for GM levels by the ELISA method at the end of the study period. Data of 58 hospitalisation episodes in 45 patients were analysed. Proven IA was diagnosed in one patient, probable IA was diagnosed in four patients. The sensitivity was 60% and the specificity was 21% when the index cut-off for positivity was accepted as 0.5. The yield of GM testing may be influenced by many variables and each centre should evaluate the usefulness of this test in its own conditions.",2010,20091935,yes
[Update: invasive fungal infections: Diagnosis and treatment in surgical intensive care medicine].,"Fungal infections are of great relevance in surgical intensive care and Candida species represent the predominant part of fungal pathogens. Invasive aspergillosis is also relevant especially in patients with chronic pulmonary diseases. It is crucial for therapy success to begin adequate antifungal treatment at an early stage of the disease. Risk stratification of individual patient symptoms is essential for therapy timing. In case of suspected or proven candida infection, fluconazole is the agent of choice when the patient is clinically stable and no azoles have been administrated in advance and the local epidemiology makes azol resistance unlikely. For clinically instable patients with organ dysfunction the echinocandins serve as primary therapy because of their broad spectrum and reasonable safety profile. Due to a relevant proportion of azole resistant Candida species, susceptibility testing should be done routinely. Depending on the species detected de-escalating to an azole is feasible if organ dysfunctions have resolved. An invasive aspergillosis is primarily treated with voriconazole.",2011,20082061,no
"Co-occurrence of aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, fumonisins, and zearalenone in cereals and feed, determined by competitive direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and thin-layer chromatography.","Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Fusarium species frequently contaminate crops. For this reason mycotoxins such as aflatoxins (AFs), ochratoxin A (OTA), fumonisins (FBs), and zearalenone (ZEA) are found in food and feed in a wide range of concentrations, depending on environmental and storage conditions. Consumption of mycotoxin-contaminated food and feed has been associated with acute and chronic poisoning and carcinoma. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and co-occurrence of AFs (B1+B2+G1+G2), OTA, FBs (B1+B2+B3), and ZEA in 37 samples of cereals and feed randomly collected in 2007 from households of an endemic nephropathy (EN) area in Croatia. The mycotoxins were determined using the competitive direct ELISA test (CD-ELISA) in combination with thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The most frequent mycotoxin was ZEA (92%, mean 318.3 microg kg-1), followed by FBs (27%, 3690 microg kg-1), AFs (24.3%, 4.6 microg kg-1), and OTA (16.2%, 9.8 microg kg-1). Levels of AFs, ZEA, and FBs detected by CD-ELISA significantly correlated with the TLC results. However, only one OTA-positive sample was confirmed by TLC due to its high limit of detection. The levels of these mycotoxins were below the permissible limit for animal feed. Twenty-nine percent of cereals were contaminated with FBs, OTA, or ZEA in mass fractions above the permissible limit for humans. Co-occurrence of two toxins varied between 4.2% and 54% and of three between 4.2% and 7.6%. Prolonged co-exposure to AFs, OTA, FBs, and ZEA might increase the risk of various chronic diseases.",2010,20061243,no
"Molecular cloning, characterization and expression of PmRsr1, a Ras-related gene from yeast form of Penicillium marneffei.","GTP-binding proteins such as Ras act as molecular switches in a large number of signal pathways. In this report, we isolated and characterized a novel Ras small monomeric GTPase Rsr1 gene, designated PmRsr1, from yeast-form Penicillium marneffei. The full-length PmRsr1 cDNA sequence is 1,866 bp in size, and contains an open reading frame of 642 bp encoding 213 amino acids. The predicted molecular mass of PmRsr1 is 24.41 kDa with an estimated theoretical isoelectric point of 9.21. The deduced amino acid sequence of PmRsr1 shows 87% identity with that of Aspergillus fumigatus and A. clavatus. Eight exons and seven introns are identified within the 2,102 bp PmRsr1 genomic DNA sequence of P. marneffei. The open reading frame was subcloned into the pcDNA6-myc-His B expression vector, and the recombinant plasmid was transfected into Vero cell line. The expressed fusion protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting. Differential expression of the PmRsr1 was demonstrated by real-time RT-PCR. The expression of PmRsr1 was the highest in the yeast phase comparing with that in the mycelia and conidia phases.",2011,20058189,no
Role of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) in innate immune response of human immature dendritic cells to Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Dysregulation of the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance and a switch to a Th2 immune response contribute to the development of and the unfavorable outcome from invasive aspergillosis (IA). We explore in this paper the role of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) in human immature dendritic cells (iDCs) relative to infection caused by A. fumigatus by the use of GSK-3 inhibitors (LiCl, SB415286) and RNA interference technology. In iDCs exposed to A. fumigatus germ tubes, inhibition of GSK-3 with LiCl or SB415286, as well as transfection with small interfering RNA, led to markedly elevated expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. In contrast, pro-inflammatory cytokine response was only partially regulated by GSK-3. Screening of patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (with or without IA) for the presence of genetic markers (rs334558, rs6438552) in the GSK-3 gene revealed no significant association with an increased risk for IA. In conclusion, GSK-3 might be involved in the regulation of the anti-inflammatory response of iDCs in the context of infections due to A. fumigatus, albeit the exact mechanisms have to be clarified in future experiments.",2010,20055739,no
Fungal infections in leukemia patients: how do we prevent and treat them?,"Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with acute or chronic leukemia. Advances in the pharmacotherapy of fungal infections and a shift in the epidemiological characteristics of fungal pathogens toward fluconazole-resistant Candida species and saprophytic molds have placed a greater emphasis on selection of broader-spectrum agents for empirical therapy of IFIs in this high-risk population. Newer diagnostic modalities, such as the Aspergillus galactomannan test, the 1,3-beta-d-glucan test, and polymerase chain reaction detection of fungal DNA, may facilitate the earlier diagnosis of IFIs, but their role in detecting breakthrough infection and their usefulness as a marker to withhold antifungal therapy in high-risk leukemia patients with IFI are less obvious, especially in patients who are receiving antifungal prophylaxis. Only 2 strategies have been shown in prospective studies to improve survival from mold infection in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome: (1) preemptive initiation of antifungal therapy at first sign of invasive aspergillosis on computed tomography (CT) scan and (2) antifungal prophylaxis with posaconazole. CT-guided treatment decisions are more complex in patients with advanced leukemia, however, because of concomitant infection or relapsing malignancy. Similarly, posaconazole is often not a viable prophylaxis or treatment option in patients with poor oral intake, gastrointestinal dysfunction, or possible drug interaction (eg, proton pump inhibitor prophylaxis in patients on high-dose glucocorticosteroids). As a result, the management of IFI in patients with leukemia demands an individualized treatment plan.",2010,20047485,no
Successful management of invasive aspergillosis presenting as pericarditis in an adult patient with chronic granulomatous disease.,Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a major cause of death among patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Few cases of cardiac aspergillosis have been published on CGD patients. Diagnosis of IA in CGD patients can be hampered by lack of characteristic symptoms and clinical signs and the serum galactomannan assay is often negative. We report the first CGD patient with IA presenting as pericarditis where combined antifungal therapy resulted in a successful outcome.,2011,20041995,no
Clinical utility and development of biomarkers in invasive aspergillosis.,"The diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis remains very difficult, and there are limited treatment options for the disease. Pre-clinical models have been used to evaluate the diagnosis and treatment of Aspergillus infection and to assess the pathogenicity and virulence of the organism. Extensive efforts in Aspergillus research have significantly expanded the genomic information about this microorganism. The standardization of animal models of invasive aspergillosis can be used to enhance the evaluation of genomic information about the organism to improve the diagnosis and treatment of invasive aspergillosis. One approach to this process has been the award of a contract by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health to establish and standardize animal models of invasive aspergillosis for the development of new diagnostic technologies for both pulmonary and disseminated Aspergillus infection. This work utilizes molecular approaches for the genetic manipulation of Aspergillus strains that can be tested in animal-model systems to establish new diagnostic targets and tools. Studies have evaluated the performance characteristics of assays for cell-wall antigens of Aspergillus including galactomannan and beta-D-glucan, as well as for DNA targets in the organism, through PCR. New targets, such as proteomic and genomic approaches, and novel detection methods, such as point-of-care lateral-flow devices, have also been evaluated. The goal of this paper is to provide a framework for evaluating genomic targets in animal models to improve the diagnosis and treatment of invasive aspergillosis toward ultimately improving the outcomes for patients with this frequently fatal infection.",2011,21686223,no
Dynamics of extracellular release of Aspergillus fumigatus DNA and galactomannan during growth in blood and serum.,"Aspergillus fumigatus is the major cause of invasive aspergillosis (IA), a disease associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing treatment for haematological malignancies. This study investigated A. fumigatus growth in vitro and in a murine model of IA in order to provide insights into the dynamics of extracellular DNA and galactomannan (GM) release and their relevance to early diagnosis of IA. Following inoculation of whole blood with 20 A. fumigatus conidia ml(-1), DNA that corresponded to the inoculum could be detected by PCR but GM was not detected in plasma separated from the blood sample, indicating that the fungus did not grow in whole blood. The quantities of DNA detected by PCR, and GM, were proportional to the amount of fungal biomass present in vitro. Fungal DNA could be detected in the sera of mice experimentally infected with A. fumigatus with maximum detection in cyclophosphamide-treated mice.",2010,20035025,no
Activation of platelets by Aspergillus fumigatus and potential role of platelets in the immunopathogenesis of Aspergillosis.,"Aspergillus fumigatus is the most frequent cause of invasive mold infections worldwide. Platelets contribute to inflammation and promote thrombosis, characteristically seen in aspergillosis, and might be involved both in antifungal defense and in the histopathological process. In the experiments reported here, in vitro activation of platelets by conidia, swollen conidia, and hyphae from A. fumigatus was assessed by flow cytometry and enzyme immunoassays. THP-1 monocytes and human monocytes with and without platelets were cultured with hyphae from A. fumigatus, and the release of interleukin-8 (IL-8) was measured by enzyme immunoassays. A. fumigatus potently induced the expression of CD62-p and CD63 and the release of CD40 ligand, RANTES, and Dickkopf homolog 1 in platelets, with particularly enhancing effects of hyphae compared with conidia. The hypha-mediated activation of platelets further enhanced the release of IL-8 both in THP-1 monocytes and in human adherent monocytes. In conclusion, we have found that A. fumigatus is a potent inducer of platelet-mediated inflammation, potentially promoting protective as well as harmful responses during aspergillosis.",2010,20008537,no
"Anti-Aspergillus human host defence relies on type 1 T helper (Th1), rather than type 17 T helper (Th17), cellular immunity.","Both interferon-gamma-producing type 1 T helper (Th1)- and interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing Th17 cells have been proposed to be involved in anti-fungal host defence. Although invasive aspergillosis is one of the most severe human fungal infections, little is known regarding the relative importance of the Th1 versus Th17 cellular immune pathways for the human anti-Aspergillus host defence. Using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and a system consisting of monocyte-derived macrophages with lymphocytes, we found that Aspergillus fumigatus is a weak inducer of human IL-17 but induces a strong Th1 response. These data were validated by the very low IL-17 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum of patients with invasive aspergillosis. Surprisingly, live A. fumigatus reduced IL-17 production induced by mitogenic stimuli. This effect was mediated through the propensity of A. fumigatus to metabolize tryptophan and release kynurenine, which modulates the inflammatory response through inhibition of IL-17 production. In conclusion, A. fumigatus does not stimulate production of IL-17 and human host defence against aspergillosis may not rely on potent Th17 responses.",2010,20002791,no
Detection of candidaemia in patients with and without underlying haematological disease.,"Diagnosing candidaemia remains difficult despite the development of new diagnostics. We report a direct comparison of three different blood-culture systems and four indirect tests. One hundred and fourteen episodes either with haematological disease and fever despite antibacterials, or with documented invasive candidiasis, were enrolled prospectively. Clinical, para-clinical information and surveillance cultures were obtained. Blood culture was performed using conventional blood-culture bottles, mycosis bottles, and the Isolator 10 lysis centrifugation system. Serum D-arabinitol/L-arabinitol (DA/LA) ratios were determined by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Antigen, mannan-antigen (Ag) and anti-mannan antibody (Ab) were detected by CandTec, Platelia Candida Ag ELISA and Candida AB/AC/AK kits, respectively. Episodes were classified as proven (n = 24), probable (n = 14), possible (n = 52) or unlikely (n = 24) invasive candidiasis. Candidaemia involved C. albicans (17), C. albicans + C. glabrata (3), C. tropicalis (1) and yeast (1). Mycosis bottles yielded two additional positives and the conventional blood culture yielded one positive not identified by other blood-culture methods. Considering proven and unlikely episodes, respectively, sensitivity and specificity were as follows: mannan-Ag and/or anti-mannan Ab: 83.3%, 78.3% DA/LA ratio: 41.7%, 86.4%",2011,20002683,no
Sterigmatocystin: occurrence in foodstuffs and analytical methods--an overview.,"Sterigmatocystin (STC) is a mycotoxin produced by fungi of many different Aspergillus species.

[Circulating galactomannan screening for early diagnosis and treatment of invasive aspergillosis].,"To explore the value of circulating galactomannan (GM) screening for early diagnosis and treatment monitoring of invasive aspergillosis (IA).Serum samples from 141 IA patients for the detection of GM by Platelia Aspergillus (Bia-Rad) were collected before and after systematic anti-fungal therapy.(1) An increase in the clinical diagnosis rate of IA was obtained on the result of GM detection. The GM positivity appeared (10+/-4.1) (8-15) d before positive sputum culture, while (12.6+/-5.7) (6-22) d before the CT positive image. (2) Among the 62 patients with consecutive serum samples, 50 were success in treatment and 12 died. A progressive decrease of GM level was found in the former group, while the rising antigen titres were found in the latter.Compared with other diagnostic test, GM test has an obvious advantage of higher positivity and earlier result.

Therapy of murine pulmonary aspergillosis with antibody-alliinase conjugates and alliin.,"Aspergillus fumigatus is an opportunistic fungal pathogen responsible for invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised individuals. The high morbidity and mortality rates as well as the poor efficacy of antifungal agents remain major clinical concerns. Allicin (diallyl-dithiosulfinate), which is produced by the garlic enzyme alliinase from the harmless substrate alliin, has been shown to have wide-range antifungal specificity. A monoclonal antibody (MAb) against A. fumigatus was produced and chemically ligated to the enzyme alliinase. The purified antibody-alliinase conjugate bound to conidia and hyphae of A. fumigatus at nanomolar concentrations. In the presence of alliin, the conjugate produced cytotoxic allicin molecules, which killed the fungus. In vivo testing of the therapeutical potential of the conjugate was carried out in immunosuppressed mice infected intranasally with conidia of A. fumigatus. Intratracheal (i.t.) instillation of the conjugate and alliin (four treatments) resulted in 80 to 85% animal survival (36 days), with almost complete fungal clearance. Repetitive intratracheal administration of the conjugate and alliin was also effective when treatments were initiated at a more advanced stage of infection (50 h). The fungi were killed specifically without causing damage to the lung tissue or overt discomfort to the animals. Intratracheal instillation of the conjugate without alliin or of the unconjugated monoclonal antibody significantly delayed the death of the infected mice, but only 20% of the animals survived. A limitation of this study is that the demonstration was achieved in a constrained setting. Other routes of drug delivery will be investigated for the treatment of pulmonary and extrapulmonary aspergillosis.",2010,19949059,no
Characterization of a new beta(1-3)-glucan branching activity of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"A new HPLC method was developed to separate linear from beta(1-6)-branched beta(1-3)-glucooligosaccharides. This methodology has permitted the isolation of the first fungal beta(1-6)/beta(1-3)-glucan branching transglycosidase using a cell wall autolysate of Aspergillus fumigatus (Af). The encoding gene, AfBGT2 is an ortholog of AfBGT1, another transglycosidase of A. fumigatus previously analyzed (Mouyna, I., Hartland, R. P., Fontaine, T., Diaquin, M., Simenel, C., Delepierre, M., Henrissat, B., and Latgé, J. P. (1998) Microbiology 144, 3171-3180). Both enzymes release laminaribiose from the reducing end of a beta(1-3)-linked oligosaccharide and transfer the remaining chain to another molecule of the original substrate. The AfBgt1p transfer occurs at C-6 of the non-reducing end group of the acceptor, creating a kinked beta(1-31-6) linear molecule. The AfBgt2p transfer takes place at the C-6 of an internal group of the acceptor, resulting in a beta(1-3)-linked product with a beta(1-6)-linked side branch. The single Afbgt2 mutant and the double Afbgt1/Afbgt2 mutant in A. fumigatus did not display any cell wall phenotype showing that these activities were not responsible for the construction of the branched beta(1-3)-glucans of the cell wall.",2010,19948732,no
[Contribution of molecular biology and Aspergillus galactomannan antigen assay for the diagnosis of histoplasmosis].,"We report a case of a pulmonary histoplasmosis in an HIV-positive patient usually living in Cambodia, with a positive Aspergillus galactomannan antigenemia resulting from a cross-reaction, that decreased after antifungal therapy. We discuss the potential interest of the detection of fungal DNA by PCR and Aspergillus galactomannan antigenemia for the diagnosis of histoplasmosis, especially in countries where Histoplasma capsulatum antigen testing is not available.",2011,19945807,no
Modulation of exaggerated-IgE allergic responses by gene transfer-mediated antagonism of IL-13 and IL-17e.,"Asthma and allergic rhinitis are almost invariable accompanied by elevated levels of immunoglobin E (IgE), and more importantly a genetic link between IgE levels and airway hyper-responsiveness has been established. We hypothesized that expression of soluble receptors directed against interleukin (IL)-13 and IL-17e would prevent the cytokines from engaging the cell-bound receptors and therefore help to attenuate allergic responses in a Cftr(-/-)-dependent mouse model of exaggerated-IgE responses. Cftr(-/-) mice were injected with recombinant adeno-associated virus 1 (rAAV1) intramuscularly expressing soluble receptors to IL-17e (IL-17Rh1fc) or IL-13 (IL-13Ralpha2Fc). Total IgE levels, in mice receiving the IL-17Rh1fc and IL-13Ralpha2Fc therapy, were lower than in the control group. Interestingly Aspergillus fumigatus (Af)-specific IgE levels were undetectable in both the mice receiving the IL-17Rh1fc and IL-13Ralpha2Fc therapies. Further flow cytometry analysis of intracellular gene expression suggests that blocking IL-17e may be interfering with signaling upstream of CD4+ and CD11b+ cells and reducing IgE levels by affecting signaling on these cell populations. In contrast it appears that IL-13 blockade acts downstream to reduce IgE levels probably by directly affecting B-cell maturation. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of targeting T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines with rAAV-delivered fusion proteins as a means to treat aberrant immune responses.",2010,19935781,no
Post-surgical invasive aspergillosis: an uncommon and under-appreciated entity.,"Post-surgical invasive aspergillosis (PSIA) is an unusual and underestimated complication of surgery. It may occur after colonization of surgical sites by airborne Aspergillus conidia during surgery, or in the immediate postoperative.We reviewed 7 cases of PSIA (1997-2006) and checked the air levels of Aspergillus conidia in the operating rooms and/or areas surrounding 5/7 patients.PSIA accounted for 8.4% (n = 83) of all cases of invasive aspergillosis. Patients had no classic predisposing conditions (wound infection (n = 4), mediastinitis (n = 2), and endotipsitis with endocarditis (n = 1)). PSIA occurred sporadically after heart, thoracic, and vascular prosthetic surgery. Aspergillus fumigatus was involved in all cases. Median time from surgery to diagnosis was 25 days. Galactomannan was only positive (> or =1 ng/mL) in 2 patients (endotipsitis with endocarditis and mediastinitis). Mortality was 100% in cases of organ/space post-surgical infections. Although the air of operating rooms taken before surgery was free of Aspergillus, airborne Aspergillus conidia levels were high (>95 CFU/m(3)) in the rooms of 2 patients.PSIA represented almost 10% of all cases of invasive aspergillosis. Our cases were not linked to high levels of Aspergillus conidia in the operating rooms but to postoperative contamination by environmental isolates present in high counts.",2010,19932132,no
Intranasally delivered siRNA targeting PI3K/Akt/mTOR inflammatory pathways protects from aspergillosis.,"Innate responses combine with adaptive immunity to generate the most effective form of anti-Aspergillus immune resistance. Although some degree of inflammation is required for protection, progressive inflammation may worsen disease and ultimately prevents pathogen eradication. To define molecular pathways leading to or diverting from pathogenic inflammation in infection, we resorted to dendritic cells (DCs), known to activate distinct signaling pathways in response to pathogens. We found that distinct intracellular pathways mediated the sensing of conidia and hyphae by lung DCs in vitro, which translate in vivo in the activation of protective Th1/Treg responses by conidia or inflammatory Th2/Th17 responses by hyphae. In vivo targeting inflammatory (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) or anti-inflammatory (STAT3/IDO) DC pathways by intranasally delivered small interfering RNA (siRNA) accordingly modified inflammation and immunity to infection. Thus, the screening of signaling pathways in DCs through a systems biology approach may be exploited for the development of siRNA therapeutics to attenuate inflammation in respiratory fungal infections and diseases.",2010,19924119,no
"Cloning, expression in Pichia pastoris, and characterization of a thermostable GH5 mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidase from Aspergillus niger BK01.","Mannans are key components of lignocellulose present in the hemicellulosic fraction of plant primary cell walls. Mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidases (1,4-beta-D-mannanases) catalyze the random hydrolysis of beta-1,4-mannosidic linkages in the main chain of beta-mannans. Biodegradation of beta-mannans by the action of thermostable mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidase offers significant technical advantages in biotechnological industrial applications, i.e. delignification of kraft pulps or the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass rich in mannan for the production of second generation biofuels, as well as for applications in oil and gas well stimulation, extraction of vegetable oils and coffee beans, and the production of value-added products such as prebiotic manno-oligosaccharides (MOS).A gene encoding mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidase or 1,4-beta-D-mannan mannanohydrolase (E.C. 3.2.1.78), commonly termed beta-mannanase, from Aspergillus niger BK01, which belongs to glycosyl hydrolase family 5 (GH5), was cloned and successfully expressed heterologously (up to 243 microg of active recombinant protein per mL) in Pichia pastoris. The enzyme was secreted by P. pastoris and could be collected from the culture supernatant. The purified enzyme appeared glycosylated as a single band on SDS-PAGE with a molecular mass of approximately 53 kDa. The recombinant beta-mannanase is highly thermostable with a half-life time of approximately 56 h at 70 degrees C and pH 4.0. The optimal temperature (10-min assay) and pH value for activity are 80 degrees C and pH 4.5, respectively. The enzyme is not only active towards structurally different mannans but also exhibits low activity towards birchwood xylan. Apparent Km values of the enzyme for konjac glucomannan (low viscosity), locust bean gum galactomannan, carob galactomannan (low viscosity), and 1,4-beta-D-mannan (from carob) are 0.6 mg mL-1, 2.0 mg mL-1, 2.2 mg mL-1 and 1.5 mg mL-1, respectively, while the kcat values for these substrates are 215 s-1, 330 s-1, 292 s-1 and 148 s-1, respectively. Judged from the specificity constants kcat/Km, glucomannan is the preferred substrate of the A. niger beta -mannanase. Analysis by thin layer chromatography showed that the main product from enzymatic hydrolysis of locust bean gum is mannobiose, with only low amounts of mannotriose and higher manno-oligosaccharides formed.This study is the first report on the cloning and expression of a thermostable mannan endo-1,4-beta-mannosidase from A. niger in Pichia pastoris. The efficient expression and ease of purification will significantly decrease the production costs of this enzyme. Taking advantage of its acidic pH optimum and high thermostability, this recombinant beta-mannanase will be valuable in various biotechnological applications.",2010,19912637,no
The effects of antifungal therapy on severe asthma with fungal sensitization and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"Very little is known about the response rates to or appropriateness of treatment for patients with allergic fungal diseases of the lung. This study assessed the effect of antifungal therapy in patients with severe asthma with fungal sensitization (SAFS) and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA).A retrospective cohort study of 33 adult patients who fulfilled the criteria for either SAFS (n = 22) or ABPA (n = 11) was conducted. All patients had received antifungal therapy for at least 6 months. The primary study end point was the effect of antifungal therapy on patients' lung function.Overall, total IgE values and radioallergosorbent test (RAST) for A. fumigatus markedly decreased after 6 months of therapy in both SAFS and ABPA patients (P = 0.004 and P = 0.005, respectively). Reduction was seen in the eosinophil count (P = 0.037), dose of oral steroids (P = 0.043) and courses of systemic steroids required (P = 0.041). Lung function also improved (P = 0.016). Four of 10 patients discontinued oral steroids after 6 months of therapy. Reduction in IgE levels (P = 0.015) and RAST for A. fumigatus was also observed (P = 0.006) for those patients treated for at least 1 year with antifungal drugs.Both ABPA and SAFS patients benefited from oral antifungal therapy. The antifungal therapy may act by reducing the antigenic load, interacting with corticosteroids or by a direct immunological effect.",2010,19909460,no
Comparison of three antigenic extracts of Eurotium amstelodami in serological diagnosis of farmer's lung disease.,"In France and Finland, farmer's lung disease (FLD), a hypersensitivity pneumonitis common in agricultural areas, is mainly caused by Eurotium species. The presence of antibodies in patients' serum is an important criterion for diagnosis. Our study aimed to improve the serological diagnosis of FLD by using common fungal particles that pollute the farm environment as antigens. Fungal particles of the Eurotium species were observed in handled hay. A strain of Eurotium amstelodami was grown in vitro using selected culture media and antigen extracts from sexual (ascospores), asexual (conidia), and vegetative (hyphae) forms were made. Antigens were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which was used to test for immunoglobulin G antibodies from the sera of 17 FLD patients, 40 healthy exposed farmers, and 20 nonexposed controls. The antigens were compared by receiver operating characteristic analysis, and a threshold was then established.

"Pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: incidence, risk factors, and outcome.","We describe a large series of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), and the risk factors and incidence of the disease in patients with isolation of Aspergillus from lower respiratory tract samples. From 2000 to 2007, we retrospectively studied all patients admitted with COPD and isolation of Aspergillus (239 16.3/1000 admissions). Multivariate logistic regression and survival curves were used. Fifty-three patients had probable IPA (3.6 cases of IPA per 1000 COPD admissions). IPA affects at least 22.1% of patients with COPD and isolation of Aspergillus in culture. In 33 of the 53 patients with probable IPA, serum galactomannan was determined",2011,19906275,no
Current status and future perspectives on molecular and serological methods in diagnostic mycology.,"Invasive fungal infections are an important cause of infectious morbidity. Nonculture-based methods are increasingly used for rapid, accurate diagnosis to improve patient outcomes. New and existing DNA amplification platforms have high sensitivity and specificity for direct detection and identification of fungi in clinical specimens. Since laboratories are increasingly reliant on DNA sequencing for fungal identification, measures to improve sequence interpretation should support validation of reference isolates and quality control in public gene repositories. Novel technologies (e.g., isothermal and PNA FISH methods), platforms enabling high-throughput analyses (e.g., DNA microarrays and Luminex xMAP) and/or commercial PCR assays warrant further evaluation for routine diagnostic use. Notwithstanding the advantages of molecular tests, serological assays remain clinically useful for patient management. The serum Aspergillus galactomannan test has been incorporated into diagnostic algorithms of invasive aspergillosis. Both the galactomannan and the serum beta-D-glucan test have value for diagnosing infection and monitoring therapeutic response.",2010,19895220,no
[Diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis: value of bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan for immunocompromised patients].,"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is an emerging disease associated with high mortality. The diagnosis is difficult, based on a combination of elements that are clinical, radiological and biological. For early detection of cases of IPA, during 25 months, we have systematically carried out on the LBA (N=355) of immunocompromised patients (N=313) a determination of Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) by ELISA (PlateliaAspergillus, BioRad). We observed 14 cases of probable API. The sensitivity of GM compared to direct examination (DE) and culture is, respectively, 64% versus 29% and 57%.

Onsite infectious agents and toxins monitoring in 12 May Sichuan earthquake affected areas.,"At 14:28 on 12 May 2008, Sichuan Province of China suffered a devastating earthquake measuring 8.0 on the Richter scale with more than 80 000 human lives lost and millions displaced. With inadequate shelter, poor access to health services, and disrupted ecology, the survivors were at enormous risk of infectious disease outbreaks. This work, believed to be unprecedented, was carried out to contain a possible outbreak through onsite monitoring of airborne biological agents in the high-risk areas. In such a mission, a mobile laboratory was developed using a customized vehicle along with state-of-art bioaerosol and molecular equipment and tools, and deployed to Sichuan 11 days after the earthquake. Using a high volume bioaerosol sampler (RCS High Flow) and Button Inhalable Aerosol Sampler equipped with gelatin filters, a total of 55 air samples, among which are 28 filter samples, were collected from rubble, medical centers, and camps of refugees, troops and rescue workers between 23 May and 9 June, 2008. After pre-treatment of the air samples, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), gel electrophoresis, limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were applied to detect infectious agents and to quantify environmental toxins and allergens. The results revealed that, while high levels of endotoxin (180 approximately 975 ng/m3) and (1,3)-beta-d-glucans (11 approximately 100 ng/m3) were observed, infectious agents such as Bacillus anthracis, Bordetella pertussis, Neisseria meningitidis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, influenza A virus, bird flu virus (H5N1), enteric viruses, and Meningococcal meningitis were found below their detection limits. The total bacterial concentrations were found to range from 250 to 2.5 x 10(5) DNA copies/L.

Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid galactomannan for the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with hematologic diseases.,"Prompt diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) remains a challenge. Galactomannan (GM) detection in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid by the Platelia enzyme immunoassay aims to further improve upon the test's utility by applying it directly to specimens from the target organ.A retrospective analysis of the Platelia assay was performed on BAL samples from 99 evaluable high-risk hematology patients, including 58 with proven or probable IPA.BAL GM demonstrated an improved sensitivity profile (91.3% with an optical density [OD] index cutoff of >or=1.0) in comparison with culture and microscopy (50% and 53.3%, respectively). The diagnostic accuracy as given by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.93 (95% confidence interval, 0.88-0.99) further decreasing the OD index cutoff to 0.5 compromised specificity more than it improved sensitivity. Estimates of the positive and negative predictive value of the Platelia assay on BAL samples (OD index, >or=1.0) were 76% and 96%, respectively. The mean BAL GM OD index was not different in neutropenic versus nonneutropenic case patients (3.9 and 4.5, respectivelyBAL GM is a valuable adjunctive diagnostic tool to other conventional microbiologic and radiologic studies.",2010,19886801,no
Aspergillus and the paediatric lung.,"Aspergillus spp produce a wide range of saprophytic and invasive syndromes in the lungs, including allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), aspergilloma and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). ABPA results from hypersensitivity to the fungus, and mainly affects patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis (CF). The treatment of choice consists of systemic corticosteroids and itraconazole. Aspergilloma is managed by observation or surgery. IPA is predominantly seen in patients with haematological malignancies, chronic granulomatous disease or immunosuppressive treatment. With the use of aggressive therapies for end-stage CF, such as heart-lung transplantation, the potential for a patient to convert from colonization or ABPA to IPA has increased. Suggestive clinical and radiological findings, supplemented with mycological data using serology and molecular biology, have enhanced the capacity to diagnose IPA in paediatric patients. While voriconazole is considered the first-line therapy in IPA, several other antifungal agents may be appropriate alternatives.",2010,19879507,no
Paracoccidioidomycosis.,"Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic fungal infection caused by Paracoccidoides brasiliensis. The infection is endemic in subtropical areas of Latin America and has a high prevalence in Brazil. The disease is acquired by airborne inhalation of conidia and is frequently observed in adult male rural workers. The juvenile type of this mycosis is less prevalent (5-10% of clinical cases) and attacks both sexes. This clinical form occurs in children and adolescents and has a subacute course with fever, toxemia, loss of weight, adenopathy, hepatoesplenomegaly, anaemia and eosinophilia. Radiologic abnormalities in the lung fields may be seen. Mucous membrane lesions occasionally occur. The clinical presentation resembles severe tuberculosis, leukaemia or lymphoma. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding yeast-like elements of P. brasiliensis in microscopic examinations of wet preparations of specimens submitted for mycologic studies. The fungus grows slowly (20-30 days) and its isolation is difficult. Histologic and serologic studies may also assist in the diagnosis of this mycosis. Sulfonamides, ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole and amphotericin B have been successfully used in the treatment of paracoccidioidomycosis. Itraconazole is the treatment of choice, being effective in more than 95% of cases. Co-trimoxazole is still frequently used especially in chronic progressive disease and as maintenance after a course of amphotericin B in severe cases of this mycosis.",2010,19879504,no

Prospective monitoring for invasive aspergillosis using galactomannan and polymerase chain reaction in high risk pediatric patients.,"The diagnosis of invasive aspergillus remains a challenge in the care of high-risk patients. Outcomes are improved when invasive aspergillus is diagnosed early, prompting the initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy. We evaluated the utility of prospective monitoring for invasive aspergillosis (IA) using biomarkers such as serum galactomannan (GM) and/or blood polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in high-risk pediatric patients.Patients with high-risk leukemia (HRL) or allogenic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients were prospectively monitored twice weekly for IA using GM and PCR for Aspergillus species.Sixty-eight patients had collected >or=2 specimens. The 1086 specimens were collected 627 from HRL (58%) and 459 (42%) from HCT recipients. Median specimens/patient was 11.0 (2 to 58), and median follow-up/patient was 98.5 days (14 to 437). Fifty-six percent of samples were obtained from patients receiving mold-active agentsThe prospective use of GM and PCR in this high-risk pediatric population did not identify cases of proven IA. A high false positive rate was not detected. It is speculated that changes in clinical practice, such as early use of empiric and/or prophylactic mold-active agent and frequent imaging studies have impacted the epidemiology of IA. In a population with low incidence of IA, the use of these assays as a screening device on blood may not further enhance current outcomes.",2010,19855303,no
Clinically driven diagnostic antifungal approach in neutropenic patients: a prospective feasibility study.,"Preemptive strategies in neutropenic patients based on serum galactomannan (GM) -guided triggering of diagnostic work-up may be time-consuming and expensive when applied to the entire population. We have assessed the feasibility of a clinically driven diagnostic strategy without GM screening.Patients with neutropenic fever underwent a baseline diagnostic work-up (BDWU three blood cultures and other examinations as indicated). An intensive diagnostic work-up (IDWUOf 220 neutropenia episodes, fever occurred in 159 cases and recurred in 28 cases. Overall, 49 IFDs were diagnosed (two by BDWU and 47 by IDWU) during 48 episodes (21.8%). Diagnostic-driven therapy was administered to 48 patients with IFDs one patient with zygomycosis died without treatment. Only one patient received empirical therapy. IDWU was required in 40% of neutropenia episodes, and only 1.4 mean blood samples per neutropenia episode were tested for GM. Our strategy allowed a 43% reduction in antifungal treatments compared with a standard empirical approach. At 3-month follow-up, 63% of patients with IFD survived, and no undetected IFDs were found.A clinically driven diagnostic approach in selected neutropenia episodes offered effective antifungal control and reduced the exposure to unnecessary antifungal treatment.",2010,19841328,no
A single UDP-galactofuranose transporter is required for galactofuranosylation in Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Galactofuranose (Galf) containing molecules have been described at the cell surface of several eukaryotes and shown to contribute to the virulence of the parasite Leishmania major and the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. It is anticipated that a number of the surface glycoconjugates such as N-glycans or glycolipids are galactofuranosylated in the Golgi apparatus. This raises the question of how the substrate for galactofuranosylation reactions, UDP-Galf, which is synthesized in the cytosol, translocates into the organelles of the secretory pathway. Here we report the first identification of a Golgi-localized nucleotide sugar transporter, named GlfB, with specificity for a UDP-Galf. In vitro transport assays established binding of UDP-Galf to GlfB and excluded transport of several other nucleotide sugars. Furthermore, the implication of glfB in the galactofuranosylation of A. fumigatus glycoconjugates and galactomannan was demonstrated by a targeted gene deletion approach. Our data reveal a direct connection between galactomannan and the organelles of the secretory pathway that strongly suggests that the cell wall-bound polysaccharide originates from its glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored form.",2009,19840949,no

Association of mannose-binding lectin deficiency with acute invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients.,"Invasive aspergillosis is a devastating infection with attributable mortality of 40% despite antifungal therapy. In animal models of aspergillosis, deficiency of mannose-binding lectin (MBL), a pattern recognition receptor that activates complement, is a susceptibility factor. MBL deficiency occurs in 20%-30% of the population. We hypothesized that MBL deficiency may be a susceptibility factor for invasive aspergillosis in humans.Serum MBL concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 65 patients with proven or probable acute invasive aspergillosis and 78 febrile immunocompromised control subjects. MBL concentrations and the frequency of MBL deficiency were compared.The median serum MBL level was significantly lower in patients with aspergillosis than in control subjects (281 ng/mL vs 835 ng/mL P = .007). MBL deficiency (MBL concentration, <500 ng/mL) was significantly more common in patients with aspergillosis than control subjects (62% vs 32%This study is the first, to our knowledge, to show an association between MBL deficiency and acute invasive aspergillosis in humans. Further study is required to investigate the causal nature of this association and to define whether diagnosis of MBL deficiency may identify immunocompromised patients at increased risk of invasive aspergillosis.",2010,19827955,no

Contribution of galactomannan antigen detection in BAL to the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with hematologic malignancies.,"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is difficult to diagnose. The detection of galactomannan (GM) in serum samples is useful for diagnosing IPA. A positive test for GM antigen in BAL has also been proposed as a criterion of IPA, although it has not been fully validated. The aim of our study was to evaluate the contribution of GM antigen detection in BAL to the diagnosis of IPA in hematologic patients.One hundred one consecutive patients treated for hematologic malignancy were explored by bronchoscopy and BAL for new pulmonary infiltrates. Both BAL fluid and serum samples were evaluated for GM using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test, with an optical density index >or= 0.5 considered positive. Respiratory samples were also examined for the presence of fungi.IPA was diagnosed in 33 patients according to European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and Mycoses Study Group consensus group criteria (six proven, 23 probable, four possible). Nineteen of these 33 patients had a positive BAL GM test, whereas three patients without IPA had false-positive results. GM detection in BAL had a sensitivity of 57.6% (95% CI, 40.8%-72.8%) and a specificity of 95.6% (95% CI, 87.8%-98.5%). Among the 19 patients with IPA whose BAL was positive for GM, 15 also had a positive serum GM test. In 11 of these 19 patients, Aspergillus was identified in the respiratory samples.Detection of GM in BAL is complementary of serum GM testing and mycologic evaluation of the respiratory samples for the diagnosis of IPA. Positive GM BAL was the sole microbiologic criterion in two of 33 patients studied.",2010,19801584,no
Identification of salivary components that induce transition of hyphae to yeast in Candida albicans.,"Candida albicans, the major human fungal pathogen, undergoes a reversible morphological transition from single yeast cells to pseudohyphae and hyphae filaments. The hyphae form is considered the most invasive form of the fungus. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of saliva on hyphae growth of C. albicans. Candida albicans hyphae were inoculated in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium with whole saliva, parotid saliva or buffer mimicking the saliva ion composition, and cultured for 18 h at 37 degrees C under aerobic conditions with 5% CO(2). Whole saliva and parotid saliva induced transition to yeast growth, whereas the culture with buffer remained in the hyphae form. Parotid saliva was fractionated on a reverse-phase C8 column and each fraction was tested for inducing transition to yeast growth. By immunoblotting, the salivary component in the active fraction was identified as statherin, a phosphoprotein of 43 amino acids that has been implicated in remineralization of the teeth. Synthetically made statherin induced transition of hyphae to yeast. By deletion of five amino acids at the negatively charged N-terminal site (DpSpSEE), yeast-inducing activity and binding to C. albicans were increased. In conclusion, statherin induces transition to yeast of C. albicans hyphae and may thus contribute to the oral defense against candidiasis.",2009,19799638,no
Comparison of lateral flow technology and galactomannan and (1->3)-beta-D-glucan assays for detection of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.,"We compared a lateral flow device to galactomannan and (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan assays to detect invasive aspergillosis in an established guinea pig model of pulmonary disease. The lateral flow device became positive earlier (day 3) than the (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan and galactomannan assays (day 5), with all samples positive by each assay on day 7.",2010,19793899,no
Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome associated with Aspergillus terreus pulmonary infection in an autologous stem cell transplant recipient.,We describe an autologous stem cell transplant recipient who developed immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) associated with Aspergillus terreus invasive pulmonary infection after recovery from neutropenia. Clinical and radiological worsening of pulmonary invasive aspergillosis coincident with a robust decline of serum galactomannan values and rising neutrophil counts should be interpreted as IRIS and should not require changes to antifungal therapy.,2010,19793067,no
Differential toxicity of antifungal protein AFP against mutants of Fusarium oxysporum.,"Antifungal protein (AFP) from Aspergillus giganteus was assayed for toxicity against the Fusarium oxysporum wild-type strain and mutants in genes involved in cell signaling (DeltapacC, pacCc Deltafmk1) or cell-wall biogenesis (DeltachsV, Deltachs7, Deltagas1). The mutants were classified into two groups according to their sensitivity to AFP: DeltapacC, Deltagas1 and Deltachs7, which were significantly more resistant to AFP than the wild-type, and pacCC, Deltafmk1 and DeltachsV, which were more sensitive. Western blot analysis revealed increased binding of AFP to the three resistant mutants, DeltapacC, Deltagas1 and Deltachs7, but also to DeltachsV, indicating that differential binding may not be a key determinant for sensitivity. Addition of Ca2+ or K+ dramatically reduced antifungal activity and binding of AFP, suggesting that these cations compete for the same targets as AFP at the surface of the fungal cell.",2009,19784931,no
Patulin-induced oxidative DNA damage and p53 modulation in HepG2 cells.,"Patulin (PAT) is a mycotoxin produced by certain species of Penicillium and Aspergillus. The aim of this study was to assess PAT-induced DNA damage and to clarify the mechanisms, using human hepatoma G2 (HepG2) cells. PAT caused significant increase of DNA migration in single cell gel electrophoresis assay. To elucidate the role of glutathione (GSH), the intracellular GSH level was modulated by pre-treatment with buthionine-(S, R)-sulfoximine, a specific GSH synthesis inhibitor. It was observed that PAT significantly induced DNA damage in GSH-depleted HepG2 cells at lower concentrations. PAT induced the increased levels of reactive oxygen species and depletion of GSH in HepG2 cells using 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate and 0-phthalaldehyde, respectively. PAT significantly increased the levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances in HepG2 cells. Also, PAT-induced p53 protein accumulation was observed in HepG2 cells, suggesting that the activation of p53 appeared to have been a downstream response to the PAT-induced DNA damage. These results demonstrate that PAT causes DNA strand breaks in HepG2 cells, probably through oxidative stress. Both GSH, as a main intracellular antioxidant, and p53 protein are responsible for cellular defense against PAT-induced DNA damage.",2010,19744505,no
Disseminated aspergillosis following resolution of Pneumocystis pneumonia with sustained elevation of beta-glucan in an Intensive Care Unit: a case report.,"Invasive aspergillosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients receiving intensive care. The double-sandwich ELISA for galactomannan is reported to have a high sensitivity (96.5%) for the detection of invasive aspergillosis when a cut-off value of 0.8 ng/ml is used. However, we have experienced a case of lethal disseminated aspergillosis in a patient that presented with a negative galactomannan (GM) test and persistent elevation of beta-D glucan (BG) levels. A 63-year-old female was admitted to our Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in acute respiratory failure and elevated BG. She had been receiving medication for Good-pasture syndrome based on anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies and myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies for 9 months and was receiving long-term prednisolone therapy (20 mg/day). On admission, her trachea was immediately intubated, and a PCR analysis of the bronchoalveolar lavage sample revealed Pneumocystis jiroveci. Trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole therapy was started for Pneumocystis pneumonia. The levels of BG remained elevated (> 100 pg/ml) during the treatment period despite the clinical resolution of Pneumocystis pneumonia, raising concerns of another complicated invasive fungal disease consequently, fosfluconazole was administered empirically. The serum BG levels, however, did not decrease. Blood cultures did not detect a fungal infection. Serum GM levels measured by a double-sandwich ELISA on the 6th, 11th, and 24th days in the ICU were negative (< 0.2 ng/ml). The patient ultimately died of multiple organ failure on the 45th ICU day. Postmortem examination revealed a disseminated fungal infection with aggressive vascular invasion of the lungs, heart, and brain. In situ hybridization with a 568-bp probe of the alkaline proteinase sequence of Aspergillus fumigatus showed specific positive staining within the fungus present in the infected lung tissue, revealing that this patient may have had a systemic infection by A. fumigatus or A. flavus. This is a case of serum GM-negative disseminated aspergillosis pathologically proven by autopsy. Persistent elevated BG levels (> 100 pg/ml) refractory to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and fosfluconazole may suggest possible Aspergillus infection and should prompt the initiation of empiric anti-aspergillosis therapies in patients at risk for fungal infection.",2010,19730788,no
Dectin-2 is a Syk-coupled pattern recognition receptor crucial for Th17 responses to fungal infection.,"Innate immune cells detect pathogens via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which signal for initiation of immune responses to infection. Studies with Dectin-1, a PRR for fungi, have defined a novel innate signaling pathway involving Syk kinase and the adaptor CARD9, which is critical for inducing Th17 responses to fungal infection. We show that another C-type lectin, Dectin-2, also signals via Syk and CARD9, and contributes to dendritic cell (DC) activation by fungal particles. Unlike Dectin-1, Dectin-2 couples to Syk indirectly, through association with the FcRgamma chain. In a model of Candida albicans infection, blockade of Dectin-2 did not affect innate immune resistance but abrogated Candida-specific T cell production of IL-17 and, in combination with the absence of Dectin-1, decreased Th1 responses to the organism. Thus, Dectin-2 constitutes a major fungal PRR that can couple to the Syk-CARD9 innate signaling pathway to activate DCs and regulate adaptive immune responses to fungal infection.",2009,19703985,no
"[Diagnostic value of plasma (1, 3)-beta-D glucan assay for invasive fungal infections in patients with hematological disorders].","The invasive fungal infections (IFI) in immunocompromised patients are associated with a high mortality rate and diagnostic difficulty. Serological methods such as aspergillus galactomannan assay (GM test) and (1, 3)-beta-D glucan (BG) assay (G test) can be used as an adjunctive method for IFI diagnosis based on their characteristics of easy-operating, rapidness and high sensitivity. Compared with GM test, G test can be more widely used except for the diagnosis of aspergillosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of G test in the diagnosis of IFI in patients with hematological disorders. The plasma was collected from 162 suspected IFI patients with hematological disorders in Beijing Daopei Hospital, including 85 patients after chemotherapy and 77 patients after stem cell transplantation from May 2007 to May 2008, BG level was measured with MB-80 Microbiology Kinetic Rapid Reader and the measured results together with the clinical characteristics were retrospectively analyzed. According to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria, there were 2 patients diagnosed as proven IFI, 18 as probable IFI, 75 as possible IFI and 67 as no IFI. The results showed that at a cutoff of 20 pg/ml, the sensitivity and specificity of G test were 75% and 91% respectively, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 71.4% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 92.4%. 51 out of the 75 possible IFI patients with elevated BG level were responsive to antifungal treatment but non responsive to broad-spectrum antibiotics, retrospectively were diagnosed as IFI, suggesting that G test improved the IFI diagnostic rate by 31.4%. In conclusion, G test is a rapid and simple method for early diagnosis of IFI in patients with hematological disorders.",2011,19698256,no
Identification of a putative Crf splice variant and generation of recombinant antibodies for the specific detection of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Aspergillus fumigatus is a common airborne fungal pathogen for humans. It frequently causes an invasive aspergillosis (IA) in immunocompromised patients with poor prognosis. Potent antifungal drugs are very expensive and cause serious adverse effects. Their correct application requires an early and specific diagnosis of IA, which is still not properly achievable. This work aims to a specific detection of A. fumigatus by immunofluorescence and the generation of recombinant antibodies for the detection of A. fumigatus by ELISA.The A. fumigatus antigen Crf2 was isolated from a human patient with proven IA. It is a novel variant of a group of surface proteins (Crf1, Asp f9, Asp f16) which belong to the glycosylhydrolase family. Single chain fragment variables (scFvs) were obtained by phage display from a human naive antibody gene library and an immune antibody gene library generated from a macaque immunized with recombinant Crf2. Two different selection strategies were performed and shown to influence the selection of scFvs recognizing the Crf2 antigen in its native conformation. Using these antibodies, Crf2 was localized in growing hyphae of A. fumigatus but not in spores. In addition, the antibodies allowed differentiation between A. fumigatus and related Aspergillus species or Candida albicans by immunofluorescence microscopy. The scFv antibody clones were further characterized for their affinity, the nature of their epitope, their serum stability and their detection limit of Crf2 in human serum.Crf2 and the corresponding recombinant antibodies offer a novel approach for the early diagnostics of IA caused by A. fumigatus.",2010,19675673,no
"Trends in invasive fungal infections, with emphasis on invasive aspergillosis.","Patterns of invasive fungal infections are changing in many ways. Although yeast infections appear to have reached a stable incidence, the number of infections as a result of Aspergillus species appears to be increasing. Especially for mould infection, the diagnosis remains difficult and the detection and identification of clinically relevant isolates to the species level requires new validated techniques. Diagnostic tests are becoming more accurate, with biological markers such as PCR, galactomannan and 1,3 beta-D-glucan undergoing clinical validation. This is of importance because an early diagnosis is associated with increased survival. Correct diagnosis and in vitro susceptibility testing are becoming imperative for guidance of therapy in the context of changing epidemiology and the emergence of acquired resistance to antifungal drugs, as is insight into host factors that increase susceptibility to invasive mould infection and into the risks associated with new treatment modalities of underlying diseases. Despite improvements in the survival rates of patients with invasive fungal infection in recent years, continued research is required to meet the challenges associated with changes in epidemiology and resistance development.",2009,19673973,no
Galactomannan assay and plasma protein electrophoresis findings in psittacine birds with aspergillosis.,"In psittacine birds, the antemortem diagnosis of aspergillosis is usually based on the clinical signalment combined with the results of diagnostic tests such as radiography, routine hematologic and biochemical analysis, and biopsy. For several years, plasma protein electrophoresis has been used as an ancillary diagnostic technique in forming a diagnosis and treatment plan in avian species. More recently, a commercially available assay to measure galactomannan, an Aspergillus species antigen, has been described for clinical use in humans, cattle, horses, dogs, and gyr falcons. This report describes several confirmed cases of aspergillosis, with accompanying clinical data, including plasma protein electrophoresis and galactomannan assay results, in addition to results of traditional evaluations by hematology, radiography, and biopsy. In clinical cases in psittacine birds, the galactomannan assay appears useful for detecting circulating Aspergillus antibody.",2009,19673459,no
High efficiency opsonin-independent phagocytosis of Candida parapsilosis by human neutrophils.,"Candida species are associated with invasive fungal infections, and C. parapsilosis has become increasingly prevalent. As key antifungal effector cells, the function of human neutrophils confronting C. parapsilosis was investigated. We hypothesized that interaction between neutrophils and Candida species may not be uniform. Opsonins were omitted from these studies to understand the antifungal mechanisms at their most basic level. Human neutrophils underwent phagocytosis of C. parapsilosis with much higher efficiency than with C. albicans. Immunofluorescence assays with ss-glucan specific antibody detected more surface exposed ss-glucan on C. parapsilosis than C. albicans. However, blockade of the ss-glucan receptor Dectin-1, reduced phagocytosis of C. albicans but not C. parapsilosis. Inclusion of excess beta-glucan, mannan, or chitin also had no effect on phagocytosis of C. parapsilosis. Consistent with the differences noted in phagocytosis, neutrophils mediated damage to C. parapsilosis but not C. albicans in assays of residual metabolic activity. C. parapsilosis was more sensitive to oxidative stress, and inclusion of antioxidant in toxicity assays decreased neutrophil mediated damage, suggesting that generation of reactive oxygen species contributes to the toxicity mechanism. These data suggest that the interaction between neutrophils and Candida species is not uniform and may partially account for differences observed in the epidemiology and natural history of infections caused by these species.",2010,19672781,no
Logic networks based on immunorecognition processes.,"The biochemical system logically processing biochemical signals using immune-specific and biocatalytic reactions was designed, and the generated output signals were analyzed by AFM and optical means. Different patterns of immune signals resulted in the formation of various interfacial structures followed by biocatalytic reactions activated by the next set of biochemical inputs. The developed approach to multisignal biosensing allows qualitative evaluation of the biochemical information in terms of YES-NO, providing the base for novel molecular-level logic analysis of complex patterns of biochemical signals. Application of AFM to read out the structures generated on the interface could potentially lead to substantial miniaturization of the immune logic systems.",2009,19663516,no
Comparison of Aspergillus galactomannan antigen testing with a new cut-off index and Aspergillus precipitating antibody testing for the diagnosis of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis.,"The usefulness of two tests in the serodiagnosis of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) was compared. The tests were the serum Aspergillus galactomannan antigen test (Platelia (R) Aspergillus) by enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) using old and new cut-off indexes, and the Aspergillus precipitating antibody test.Both Aspergillus-precipitating antibody and Platelia Aspergillus EIA positivity were measured in the sera of 28 patients at the time of diagnosis of CPA.Serum Aspergillus precipitating antibody positivity was 89.3% (25/28) in CPA patients. Serum Platelia Aspergillus EIA positivity was 21.4% (6/28) using the old cut-off index (> or =1.5) and 50% (14/28) using the new cut-off index (> or =0.5)-still less than that for Aspergillus precipitating antibody. Three of the 28 CPA patients had positive reactions in the Platelia Aspergillus EIA using the old cut-off index but not in the Aspergillus precipitating antibody test. Positivity for (1,3) beta-d glucan was 15.4%, and that for culture on CHROMagar Candida was 17.9%. One patient with pulmonary actinomycosis had a false-positive reaction in the Platelia Aspergillus test with the new cut-off index.For the diagnosis of CPA, Aspergillus precipitating antibody testing is more sensitive than the Platelia Aspergillus EIA, even with the new cut-off index. False-positive reactions are observed with the Platelia Aspergillus EIA in patients with conditions such as pulmonary actinomycosis. Results should be interpreted with care when patients are positive for the Platelia Aspergillus EIA but negative for Aspergillus precipitating antibody.",2010,19659648,no
Endochitinase CHI2 of the biocontrol fungus Metarhizium anisopliae affects its virulence toward the cotton stainer bug Dysdercus peruvianus.,"Chitinases have been implicated in fungal cell wall remodeling and play a role in exogenous chitin degradation for nutrition and competition. Due to the diversity of these enzymes, assigning particular functions to each chitinase is still ongoing. The entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae produces several chitinases, and here, we evaluate whether endochitinase CHI2 is involved in the pathogenicity of this fungus. We constructed strains either overexpressing or lacking the CHI2 chitinase. These constructs were validated by Southern, Northern and Western blot analysis, and chitinase production. To access the effects of CHI2 chitinase in virulence, the cotton stainer bug Dysdercus peruvianus was used as a host. CHI2 overexpression constructs showed higher efficiency in host killing suggesting that the production of this chitinase by a constitutive promoter reduces the time necessary to kill the insect. More significantly, the knock out constructs showed decreased virulence to the insects as compared to the wild type strain. The lack of this single CHI2 chitinase diminished fungal infection efficiency, but not any other detectable trait, showing that the M. anisopliae family 18, subgroup B endochitinase CHI2 plays a role in insect infection.",2009,19649636,no
Separation of chitooligosaccharides and the potent effects on gene expression of cell surface receptor CR3.,"Chitooligosaccharides were prepared through hydrolysis of colloidal chitosan by enzyme source from Aspergillusfumigatus BSF114. Chitosan pentamer (COS5) and chitosan hexamer (COS6) were isolated and purified from COS by the ultra-filtration, nano-filtration, ethanol precipitation and the CM-Sephadex C-25 column. COS5 consisted of (GlcN)4 (59.84%) and (GLcN)5 (40.16%). COS6, however, mainly consisted of (GLcN)6 (93.11%) and (GLcN)(5) (6.89%). Effects of COS5 and COS6 in vivo and in vitro on gene expression of cell surface CR3 receptor were investigated by relatively quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA. The results showed that the expression of CR3 mRNA could be promoted by both COS5 and COS6. The promotion effect caused by COS6 was greater than that of COS5.",2010,19635497,no
A food-grade enzyme preparation with modest gluten detoxification properties.,"Celiac sprue is a life-long disease characterized by an intestinal inflammatory response to dietary gluten. A gluten-free diet is an effective treatment for most patients, but accidental ingestion of gluten is common, leading to incomplete recovery or relapse. Food-grade proteases capable of detoxifying moderate quantities of dietary gluten could mitigate this problem.We evaluated the gluten detoxification properties of two food-grade enzymes, aspergillopepsin (ASP) from Aspergillus niger and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) from Aspergillus oryzae. The ability of each enzyme to hydrolyze gluten was tested against synthetic gluten peptides, a recombinant gluten protein, and simulated gastric digests of whole gluten and whole-wheat bread. Reaction products were analyzed by mass spectrometry, HPLC, ELISA with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an immunodominant gluten epitope, and a T cell proliferation assay.ASP markedly enhanced gluten digestion relative to pepsin, and cleaved recombinant alpha2-gliadin at multiple sites in a non-specific manner. When used alone, neither ASP nor DPPIV efficiently cleaved synthetic immunotoxic gluten peptides. This lack of specificity for gluten was especially evident in the presence of casein, a competing dietary protein. However, supplementation of ASP with DPPIV enabled detoxification of moderate amounts of gluten in the presence of excess casein and in whole-wheat bread. ASP was also effective at enhancing the gluten-detoxifying efficacy of cysteine endoprotease EP-B2 under simulated gastric conditions.Clinical studies are warranted to evaluate whether a fixed dose ratio combination of ASP and DPPIV can provide near-term relief for celiac patients suffering from inadvertent gluten exposure. Due to its markedly greater hydrolytic activity against gluten than endogenous pepsin, food-grade ASP may also augment the activity of therapeutically relevant doses of glutenases such as EP-B2 and certain prolyl endopeptidases.",2009,19621078,no
"Invasive Aspergillus infections in allo-SCT recipients: environmental sampling, nasal and oral colonization and galactomannan testing.","A study was performed to investigate the air quality of a haematopoietic SCT ward, colonization of the upper airways with Aspergillus spp. and the role of galactomannan (GM) ELISA testing in serum in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA). In 102 allo-SCT recipients, two cases of IA (one proven and one probable) were seen. Of 2071 serum samples, 12 were positive, two in a patient with proven IA and 10 in patients without IA. Of the 2059 negative samples, 22 were taken from the patient with probable IA. Of the 245 environmental samples, 20 (8.2%) were positive for filamentous fungi. Aspergillus fumigatus was seen in 14 samples. A total of 657 oral and nasal swabs were taken. Seven nasal samples and one oral sample were positive for Aspergillus species (A. fumigatus 4, A. niger 4) in four patients, one of whom had probable IA. In summary, most environmental samples were negative, colonization of the oral and nasal cavities was rare and IA was diagnosed in only 2% of patients. The GM ELISA test remained negative in one of two patients with IA and does not seem useful in a population of patients with a low incidence of IA.",2010,19617902,yes

Expression and potential role of major inflammatory cytokines in experimental keratomycosis.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and regulation of the four major inflammatory cytokines in fungal keratitis (FK) with the goal of further understanding its pathogenesis in order to develop more effective therapeutic approaches.Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans were the corneal pathogens selected for this study to establish murine FK using epikeratophakia with the aid of corneal epithelium erasion. One, three, five, and seven days post-infection, the corneal lesions and inflammatory responses were observed by slit-lamp and histopathology, and the expressions of the four inflammatory cytokines, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (KC), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), in the infected corneas were determined using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For the intervention experiment with neutralizing antibodies, the experimental mice were then injected subconjunctivally with 5 microl (2 ng/microl) MIP-2 or IL-1beta polyclonal antibody 1 h before and 24 h after surgery. Reestablishment of the FK murine model was performed following injection. Effects of MIP-2 or IL-1beta polyclonal antibody on the corneal diseases were observed by slit-lamp microscopy, histopathology, and ELISA.Expression of MIP-2, KC, IL-1beta, and IL-6 was upregulated significantly in the infected group one, three, five, and seven days after surgery. Following treatment with an MIP-2 polyclonal antibody, the corneal clinical scores and inflammatory responses decreased, the MIP-2 protein levels were downregulated significantly (p<0.01), and the KC protein levels decreased slightly (p>0.05). Upon administration of IL-1beta polyclonal antibodies, the decrease in clinical scores, inflammatory responses, and protein levels of MIP-2 and KC was apparent at 1 and 3 days after infection (p<0.01).A persistent, high level expression of MIP-2 and IL-1beta is an important and even major factor in the corneal pathogenesis of FK. Specific polyclonal neutralizing antibodies may be administered to inhibit the major chemokines and cytokines responsible for corneal damage thus effectively relieving the injury caused by FK.",2009,19590756,no
Mycobiota and concentration of ochratoxin A in concentrated poultry feed from Venezuela.,"The main objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency distribution of mycobiota and the concentration of Ochratoxin A (OTA) in 50 samples from one company of commercial brand poultry feed produced in Venezuela. The concentration of OTA in the samples analyzed was determined using the competitive ELISA method. The most frequently isolated genera of moulds were Aspergillus (36%) and Penicillium (20%). Of these genera, the most frequently isolated species were Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus terreus and Penicillium citrinum. Ochratoxigenic species such as Eurotium herbariorum, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus ochraceus and Aspergillus glaucus, were also found with lower frequency. Rhodotorula mucilaginosa was the only yeast isolated. 94% of the samples presented contamination by OTA in a range between 2.558 and 31.978 microg kg(-1) feed and 42% of them presented OTA levels from 10 up to 20 microg kg(-1).

[The role of galactomannan detection in the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in critically ill patients].,"To evaluate the usefulness of serum galactomannan (GM) for the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in critically ill patients.Study was conducted between February 2007 and July 2008. Included patients on admission ICU who suffer from suspected IPA. GM test and culture were collected 2 weekly. Clinical feature, mycological evidence and optical density index (ODI) were noted. Clinically invasive fungal infection (IFI) were defined proven, probable and possible. The patients were classified into neutropenia, non-neutropenia and treated with immunosuppressive agents, non-neutropenia and non-immunosuppressive agents. To compared of the sensitivity and specificity of GM in different patients.94 patients were included, 4 patients were proven, 29 patients were probable, 34 patients were possible IFI, 27 patients were non-IPA. The positive rate of the GM was 31.9% (30/94). The sensitivity and specificity of GM in proven cases and probable cases are 66.7% and 92.6%. GM assay tended to become positive earlier than the culture 2 - 10 (5.33 +/- 2.17) d. We found that differences in patient diagnosis and selection might account for the disparities seen for positive rate for the GM test. There was positive in three of the four patients with proven, the positive rate of GM was 65.5% for probable cases, for possible cases was 17.6%, for non-IPA cases was 7.4% (P = 0.001). For patient with neutropenia, treated with immunosuppressive agents and without immunosuppressive agents, the positive rate of GM was 52.9% vs 41.7% vs 34.6% (P = 0.015) the sensitivity was 80.0% vs 70.0% vs 53.8% (P = 0.011), the ODI was 1.365 (0.582 - 6.736) vs 1.123 (0.623 - 6.868) vs 0.554 (0.522 - 0.823), P = 0.005, respectively.These results show that GM test is useful for early diagnosis IPA in critically ill patients. Differences in patient selection and diagnosis might account for the disparities seen for positive rate and sensitivity for the GM test. It has been higher sensitivity and ODI in the patient treated by immunosuppressive agents.",2009,19576092,yes
NAC is associated with additional alleviation of lung injury induced by invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in a neutropenic model.,"Neutropenic individuals are at high risk for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), a life-threatening infection. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of antioxidants, IPA was induced in neutropenic mice and the effect of N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) on oxidative stress levels and lung injury was analyzed.Mice were pretreated with three daily intraperitoneal injections of 150 mg/kg cyclophosphamide, followed by intratracheal inoculation with 4.5x10(6) conidia of Aspergillus fumigatus. The infected mice were then randomly assigned to an amphotericin B (AMB) group, an AMB plus NAC group, or an untreated control (C) group. In each group, the duration of treatment was 24, 48, or 72 h, and activities such as appearance, feeding, and dermal temperature were observed throughout the experiment. Sera and lung tissues were collected and analyzed by quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for total protein, superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels. The wet/dry weight ratio of the lung was also calculated and lung sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin for pathological examination and with methenamine silver stain for fungus detection.Compared with the mice untreated with NAC, mice in the AMB plus NAC group had increased SOD and reduced MDA levels both systemically and locally at 24, 48, and 72 h after inoculation with conidia. NAC treatment also decreased the pulmonary protein content at 48 and 72 h and the lung wet/dry weight ratio at 24 and 48 h. Additionally, NAC enhanced pulmonary production of TNF-alpha and IL-10 at 24 h and 48 h.In combination with antifungal therapy, NAC treatment can alleviate oxidative stress and lung injury associated with IPA in neutropenic mice.Acta Pharmacologica Sinica (2009) 30: 980-986 doi: 10.1038/aps.2009.83.",2009,19575001,no
[Value of serum galactomannan assay in the diagnosis of pediatric invasive pulmonary aspergillosis].,"Galactomannan (GM) is a major aspergilli cell-wall constituent released into circulation during the early stage of invasive disease, and can be detected. Many studies suggest that serum galactomannan assay has an excellent sensitivity and specificity for the early diagnosis of adult invasive aspergillosis (IA). However, there have been few studies on serum galactomannan assay in pediatric patients. Therefore, we evaluate the value of serum galactomannan assay in the diagnosis of pediatric invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in this study.Blood samples were obtained from 88 children, of whom 14 had definitive or possible invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), 16 had other invasive pulmonary fungal infection and 58 had pulmonary non-fungal infection. Of the 58 patients, 23 had bacterial pneumonia, 20 had mycoplasma pneumonia and 15 had pulmonary tuberculosis. A double-direct sandwich ELISA was employed to detect GM optical density index (ODI) in the serum sample. GM ODI were observed before and after treatment in six children with IPA. Measurement data followed the Gaussian distribution were expressed as x(-) +/- s differences among groups were tested using a single factor analysis of variance. If the s>1/3 x(-), measurement data were expressed as M [minimum, maximum], and the differences among groups were tested by a rank sum test. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.The serum GM ODI in IPA group [1.03 (0.16 - 3.73)] was significantly higher than that in the other invasive pulmonary fungal infection group [0.30 (0.04 - 1.28)] and pulmonary non-fungal infection group [0.24 (0.08 - 0.69)] (P < 0.05). If the cut-off GM ODI was set at 0.5, the sensitivity and specificity of the assay for IPA were 71.4% and 91.9% respectively. The accuracy rate for IPA was 88.6%. If the cut-off GM ODI was set at 0.8, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy rate for IPA were 64.2%, 98.6% and 93.2% respectively. Of 6 children whose GM were observed serially, GM ODI declined consistently with the clinical remission in 3 children. GM ODI raised in 2 children corresponding to clinical exacerbation. Whereas GM ODI elevated paradoxically regardless of clinical remission in the remaining one patient.Serum GM detection was an effective method for the diagnosis of pediatric IPA.",2011,19573449,yes
[Current status of invasive fungal infections. New diagnostic techniques and antifungal agents].,"In the last few years, major advances in the treatment of transplant recipients, with hemato-oncological diseases or admitted to the intensive care unit, has been accompanied by an increase in classical fungal infections and by the emergence of uncommon fungal infections. Despite the development of new diagnostic techniques such as galactomannan detection and the availability of new antifungal agents, these opportunistic infections continue to pose a diagnostic challenge, prolong length of hospital stay, and increase costs. In addition, mortality from these infections is high. The present chapter provides a brief review of the epidemiology of these infections, diagnostic advances, and the new antifungal agents that have been developed in the last few years.",2009,19572428,no
Diagnosing invasive fungal diseases - limitations of microbiological diagnostic methods.,"Invasive fungal infections (IFD) are a principal cause of morbidity and mortality in immunosuppressed patients, with case fatality rates ranging from 30 - 80% in neutropenic patients. This results at least partly from difficulties in obtaining a reliable and early diagnosis. Conventional methods, for example culture-based methods, may be difficult and are often delayed. Serological tests such as the galactomannan enzyme immunoassay are at present most promising for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis however, sensitivity and specificity vary within the studies. Similar data are shown for Aspergillus detection by polymerase chain reaction.The aim of this article is to review classical and new diagnostic tools for the identification of invasive fungal infections and to summarize current limitations of these methods.The early diagnosis of IFD still remains a problem as existing tools lack sensitivity or specificity. Therefore, the combination of microscopy, culture-based methods, and serological and molecular techniques is necessary to allow early detection of IFD.",2009,23485213,no
RIOK3 interacts with caspase-10 and negatively regulates the NF-kappaB signaling pathway.,"RIOK3 was initially characterized as a homolog of Aspergillus nidulans sudD and showed down-regulation at the invasive front of malignant melanomas, but the molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report that overexpression of RIOK3 inhibits TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation, but down-regulation of endogenous RIOK3 expression by siRNA potentiates it. A yeast two-hybrid experiment revealed that RIOK3 interacted with caspase-10, and further, a GST pull-down assay and endogenous coimmunoprecipitation validated the interaction. We subsequently showed that the interaction was mediated by the RIO domain of RIOK3 and each death effector domain of caspase-10. Interestingly, our data demonstrated that RIOK3 suppressed caspase-10-mediated NF-kappaB activation by competing RIP1 and NIK to bind to caspase-10. Importantly, the kinase activity of RIOK3 was confirmed to be relevant to NF-kappaB signaling. Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that RIOK3 negatively regulates NF-kappaB signaling pathway activated by TNFalpha dependent on its kinase activity and NF-kappaB signaling pathway activated by caspase-10 independent of its kinase activity.",2010,19557502,no
Biosensor-based screening method for the detection of aflatoxins B1-G1.,"Aflatoxins are extremely toxic metabolites from Aspergillus species that can adulterate a wide range of human foodstuff. Herein, we propose a novel assay designed as an analytical test for aflatoxin B1 and G1 (AFB1 and AFG1, respectively) that could represent an alternative screening technique for this class of mycotoxins. The approach for the determination of these toxins is based on surface plasmon resonance using neutrophil porcine elastase as a ""bait"" for these aflatoxins. The selection and optimization of the analytical procedure involved a preliminary investigation on the type of inhibition by AFB1: the level of the protease inhibition exerted by AFB1 depended upon the incubation time and the concentration of the binding partners, showing the competitiveness and the reversibility of the inhibition. A posteriori, the nature of the interaction granted a rapid analysis, a single detection test requiring only a few minutes. For the development of the assay, the experimental conditions were evaluated and optimized with both calibration solution and aflatoxin-spiked samples. To apply this method to aflatoxin-contaminated maize, a rapid solid-phase extraction treatment was developed. The proposed assay for AFB1 and AFG1 was validated by comparison with both a chromatographic reference method and a standard enzyme linked immunosorbent assay procedure. This enzyme-based biosensor represents a new approach for the detection of aflatoxins based on the reversible interaction between a blocked macromolecule and a soluble ligand, having the major advantages in the relative rapidity, the reusability of the capturing surface, and low cost per single test.",2009,19551989,no
[A preliminary investigation on early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in patients with blood diseases by using circulating galactomannan test].,"The objective of this study was to explore the useful value of circulating galactomannan (GM) for early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. All 141 patients were classified as 103 patients of clinical and possible diagnosis, and 38 non-Aspergillus patients. 209 serum samples for the detection of GM by Platelia Aspergillus were collected before anti-fungal vaccine therapy. ELISA method was used in detection of GM. The results showed that (1) the sensitivity of 87.5%, specificity of 81.6%, positive prediction of 66.7% and negative prediction of 93.9% were determined by using cut-off value. According to the result of ELISA, the clinical diagnosed patients was up to 48, while the possible diagnosed patients were 55. (2) Among 62 patients with consecutive examinations of serum samples, 50 patients were successfully diagnosed and treated, while 12 patients died. A progressive reduction of GM level was found in survivors, however, the patients of poor prognosis showed higher antigen titres. It is concluded that GM test has more significance for earlier diagnosis of aspergillosis, the concentration of GM is related to prognosis of disease.",2011,19549404,no
Chronic myelogenous leukemia in a great horned owl (Bubo virginianus).,"A free-ranging adult female great horned owl (Bubo virginianus) was presented to the Wildlife Medical Clinic at the University of Illinois after being observed with anorexia and decreased activity. A severe leukocytosis (212 400 cells/microl), primarily comprised of mature heterophils, was found at presentation. Results of various diagnostic tests including radiographs, Chlamydophila serologic testing, measurement of Aspergillus antibody and antigen titers, plasma protein electrophoresis, fecal culture and acid-fast staining, coelioscopy, endoscopy, tracheoscopy, exploratory coelomotomy, nuclear scintigraphy, tissue cultures, bone marrow biopsy, and histopathology revealed no underlying cause for the persistent leukocytosis. No response to treatment with antibiotics or antifungal agents was observed, although a transient, significant decrease in the leukocyte count (6200 cells/microl) was observed after treatment with fenbendazole. A presumptive diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia was made based on 3 factors: disease duration of greater than 3 months, a lack of identifiable foci of inflammation, and a lack of response to conventional therapy. The diagnosis was confirmed based on postmortem examination and testing 177 days after initial presentation.",2009,19530405,no
"Stray dogs as reservoirs of the zoonotic agents Leptospira interrogans, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Aspergillus spp. in an urban area of Chiapas in southern Mexico.","This investigation determined the presence and prevalence of the zoonotic agents Leptospira interrogans, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Aspergillus spp. in the stray dog population (a total of 224 stray dogs) in an urban area of Southern Mexico. Blood serum samples were taken from all dogs, and root hair samples were taken from dogs with skin lesions and partial alopecia. IgG antibodies for L. interrogans from 10 serovars were detected using the microscopic agglutination test. Immunofluorescence antibody test and Western blot assay were used for serologic diagnosis of T. cruzi. The Sabouraud medium was used to isolate Aspergillus spp. Prevalence of L. interrogans was 4.9%, which was determined by identifying only serovars Pyrogenes, which accounted for 3.6%, and Tarassovi, which constituted 1.3%, with titers from 1:100 to 1:800. Additionally, T. cruzi antibodies were detected in 4.5% of the dogs. Skin lesions were found in 43% of the dogs (98/224), and 35 cultures were positive for Aspergillus spp. (35.7%, p < 0.05, 95% confidence interval 2.45-3.67), identified as A. niger (82.8%), A. flavus (14.3%), and A. terreus (2.9%). This study demonstrates the presence of certain zoonotic agents (bacteria, protozoa, and fungi) in stray dogs living within the studied area. Dogs play an important role in the transmission of diseases that are potentially harmful to humans. Although the prevalence of canine leptospirosis and trypanosomiasis is not high in Southern Mexico compared with other tropical regions of Mexico, the presence of these zoonotic agents in the stray dog population demonstrates that the stray dog population in this region is a significant reservoir and potential source of infection in humans. Special care should be taken when handling stray dogs that exhibit skin lesions with partial alopecia, since a pathological Aspergillus sp. fungus may be present.",2010,19514808,no
Prevention and treatment of invasive fungal diseases in neutropenic patients.,"Despite advances in the diagnosis and management, invasive fungal diseases contribute substantially to the morbidity and mortality of patients with prolonged neutropenia.Major advances in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of invasive fungal diseases have occurred with the introduction of fungal markers and new antifungal agents over the past decade. The newer broad-spectrum azoles and echinocandins, due to their acceptable safety profiles and efficacy, have emerged as valuable options as antifungal prophylaxis and therapy. Empirical antifungal therapy, a strategy in which persistent neutropenic fever triggers the addition of an antifungal agent, remains a common practice. However, the development of fungal diagnostic markers (e.g. galactomannan and beta-glucan assays) combined with radiologic imaging has given potential to more targeted preemptive antifungal strategies.With the validation of preemptive strategies in clinical trials, we will likely have evidence-based targeted use of antifungals. PCR-based techniques are also promising tools for preemptive strategies and are undergoing evaluation. Knowledge of host genetic factors may be important in stratifying the risk for fungal disease during periods of high risk.",2009,19506476,no
Invasive mould infections in the setting of hematopoietic cell transplantation: current trends and new challenges.,"Invasive mould infections remain major causes of infection-related mortality following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the diagnosis, prevention, and management of invasive mould infections in HSCT recipients.The evolving epidemiologic characteristics of post-HSCT invasive mould infections, specifically the rising incidence of Aspergillus and non-Aspergillus mould infections in the postengraftment period, necessitate the development of preventive strategies. The efficacy of prophylactic broad-spectrum triazoles against invasive mould infections in HSCT recipients has now been demonstrated in two large prospective studies. However, concerns over drug absorption, interactions, and costs may shift attention from universal prophylaxis to risk stratification and preemptive strategies. In this regard, recent studies have highlighted the potential of genetic polymorphism analysis to identify HSCT recipients at risk for invasive aspergillosis, and efforts are underway to improve the predictive values of antigen and nucleic acid detection assays. Emerging data on risk factors for invasive aspergillosis relapse after HSCT, antifungal drug monitoring, and the use of galactomannan testing to monitor treatment response may help inform therapeutic decisions for HSCT recipients.Evidence-driven management of invasive mould infections in HSCT recipients is becoming increasingly individualized, integrating host factors and pharmacologic and epidemiologic considerations. However, the optimal approach to invasive mould infection prevention in HSCT recipients remains to be resolved by prospective clinical studies.",2009,19491674,no
"[Detection of 1,3-beta-D glucan for diagnosis of invasive fungal infections in hematooncological patients: usefulness for screening of invasive mycosis and for confirmation of galactomannan positive results].","1,3-beta-D glucan (BG) -- the antigen of fungal cell wall can be detected by a commercially available test for early detection of invasive fungal infections (IFI). The main advantage of this test is its broad coverage of fungal species. The aim of our study was to evaluate usefulness of BG detection for screening of IFI and for confirmation of galactomannan (GM) positive blood samples. Combination of the results of both tests could lead to correct and early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA).Between January 2005 and July 2007 blood samples were collected in patients from intermediate to high risk of IFI. Moreover, between February and October 2007 all patients that had consecutive positive results of GM had their positive symplex tested also for BG.In BG screening study, 1154 of blood samples from 104 treatment cycles were tested for BG. The incidence of IFI was 17.3 % (n = 18) and probable or proven IFI was detected in 9 cases (8.6%). The highest sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV (88.9 %, 40.7 %, 13.6 % and 97.2 %) were obtained when as criteria for positivity cut off 80 pg/ml and one positive result were used. When consecutive positivity of the test was applied as criterium, cut off 60 pg/ml was found more useful (sensitivity 66.7 %, specificity 47.7 %, PPV 11.8 % and NPV 93.2 %). Low PPV, caused by frequent false positive results, was identified as main limitation of this assay. 65 treatment cycles were positive if 1 sample above 80 pg/ml was used as a cut of for positivity. If consecutive positivity with cut off 60 pg/ml was used, 58 treatment cycles were positive. But in 51 (78.4 %) and 45 (77.5 %) cases, respectively, the positivity was not associated with IFI (false positivity). We did not find any correlation between positive BG assay result and frequency of empirical antifungal treatment, mucositis, yeast colonization, administration of selected antibiotics or infusion solutions or bacteriaemia. In our confirmation study, 40 GM positive episodes in 39 patients were identified. In 31 (78 %) GM positivity was false and was not associated with clinical signs and symptoms of IA. Sensitivity of GM detection in IA was 100 % but PPV only 18 %. Confirmation of consecutive GM positive samples (using cut off index positivity 0,5) by consecutive positivity of BG (with cut off 60 pg/ml) was found very useful for diagnosis of IA -- most of GM false positive results were eliminated and PPV increased to 88 %.Our analysis focused on routine use of BG test for panfungal screening of IFI in patients with hematological malignancy and confirmed limited usefulness of this test in such setting. Low sensitivity together with low PPV are major limits of this test. On the other hand, BG testing seems to be a promising tool for confirmation of consecutive GM positive result in serum in patients with IA. Positivity of both tests could increase their PPV of tests and eliminate false positive results.",2009,19488961,no
Diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy of lung infiltrates in febrile neutropenic patients: Guidelines of the infectious diseases working party of the German Society of Haematology and Oncology.,"Patients with neutropenia lasting for more than 10d, who develop fever and pulmonary infiltrates, are at risk of treatment failure under conventional broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy. Filamentous fungi are predominant causes of failure, however, multi-resistant gram-negative rods such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Stenotrophomonas maltophilia may be involved. Prompt addition of mould-active systemic antifungal therapy, facilitated by early thoracic computed tomography, improves clinical outcome. Non-culture-based diagnostic procedures to detect circulating antigens such as galactomannan or 1,3-beta-d-glucan, or PCR techniques to amplify circulating fungal DNA from blood, bronchoalveolar lavage or tissue specimens, may facilitate the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. CT-guided bronchoalveolar lavage is useful in order to identify causative microorganisms such as multidrug-resistant bacteria, filamentous fungi or Pneumocystis jiroveci. For pre-emptive antifungal treatment, voriconazole or liposomal amphotericin B is preferred. In patients given broad-spectrum azoles for antifungal prophylaxis, non-azole antifungals or antifungal combinations might become first choice in this setting. Antifungal treatment should be continued for at least 14 d before non-response and treatment modification are considered. Microbial isolates from blood cultures, bronchoalveolar lavage or respiratory secretions must be critically interpreted with respect to their aetiological relevance for pulmonary infiltrates.",2009,19467584,no
Combination therapy with micafungin and amphotericin B for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in an immunocompromised mouse model.,"Antifungal monotherapy with polyenes, azoles or echinocandins is not always effective for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a combination of micafungin and amphotericin B for the primary treatment of IPA in an immunocompromised mouse model.Female ICR mice were used in all experiments. An immunosuppressive state was induced in mice by an intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide. Mice were intratracheally inoculated with Aspergillus fumigatus conidia, treated with micafungin, amphotericin B or both for 7 days, and were tested for their survival 20 days after the Aspergillus inoculation. Fungal burden in lungs, serum galactomannan index (GMI) and histopathology of lungs, spleen and kidneys were also evaluated.Combination therapy with micafungin and amphotericin B gave excellent survival of infected mice compared with monotherapy with micafungin or amphotericin B alone. Combined therapy reduced the fungal burden in the lungs and the serum GM levels compared with monotherapy or untreated controls, resulting in a significant histological improvement with disappearance of fungi in the lungs.These findings suggest that combination therapy with micafungin and amphotericin B is more effective compared with monotherapy with either of them alone for IPA treatment.",2009,19465436,no
Ochratoxigenic Aspergillus species on grapes from Chilean vineyards and Aspergillus threshold levels on grapes.,"This study reports the incidence of ochratoxigenic strains of Aspergillus on Chilean grapes (Vitis vinifera) and wineries, and production of OTA levels in wines with grapes having different levels of contamination with OTA-producing Aspergillus carbonarius was studied. A. carbonarius, A. niger, A. niveus, A. paradoxus, A. versicolor, A. wentii, and A. westerdijkiae were identified on apparently healthy clusters of red and white grape cultivars. However, A. carbonarius and A. niger were the most frequently identified species, more abundant on red than white grape cultivars. Aspergillus spp. populations increased between veraison and harvest, but the isolation frequencies were relatively low over the entire growing season. At the winery, A. carbonarius, A. niger and A. westerdijkiae were occasionally found in the air, exclusively during winemaking. OTA-producing strains were only found among isolates of A. carbonarius, A. niger, A. wenti, and A. westerdijkiae, producing 2 to 17 microg/L of OTA in liquid medium however, A. westerdijkiae produced the highest OTA concentration in vitro. Red wines elaborated with 0.5% of grapes infected with an OTA-producing strain of A. carbonarius (Aspuc-SB36) exceeded the 2 microg/L of OTA tolerance established for wines by the European Community. Therefore, a threshold below 0.5% infected berries is proposed for red wines. ELISA tests proved to be useful for detecting OTA in broth culture as in wine samples.",2009,19464066,no
"Molecular and immunological characterization of Asp f 34, a novel major cell wall allergen of Aspergillus fumigatus.","Although fungal spores have been recognized as triggers of respiratory allergy and asthma, only two allergenic fungal cell wall components have so far been described.Eighty-one sequences derived from an Aspergillus fumigatus cDNA library encoding putative allergens were examined for the presence of cell wall components. A new allergen (Asp f 34) was evaluated by Western blots, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation assays, and skin prick test (SPT).The cDNA encoding Asp f 34 contained an open reading frame predicting a protein of 185 amino acids with a molecular weight of 19.38 kDa, showing sequence homology to phiA, an essential protein for the formation of conidia in the genus Aspergillus. The recombinant Asp f 34 was binding IgE from sensitized individuals in Western blots. An ELISA survey showed that 94% of the ABPA and 46% of the A. fumigatus-sensitized individuals tested had Asp f 34-specific serum IgE. Asp f 34 induced allergen-specific proliferation exclusively of PBMCs from patients sensitized to the allergen. Eight patients with anti-Asp f 34 serum IgE tested reacted positively in SPT, whereas four A. fumigatus-sensitized individuals without Asp f 34-specific IgE and eight healthy controls scored negatively.A cell wall protein of the phialides of A. fumigatus was identified as a major allergen. Asp f 34 belongs to the Aspergillus-specific proteins of the phiA family and has relevant potential for a specific diagnosis of Aspergillus sensitization.",2009,19416144,no
Fatal Aspergillus rhinosinusitis during induction chemotherapy in a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"Invasive fungal infections are a major problem in patients treated for hematologic malignancies. We report a 3-year-old girl who suffered from febrile neutropenia during induction therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Initial chest computed tomography revealed no evidence of intrapulmonary fungal lesions, however, plasma galactomannan ratio was positive. Aspergillus flavus was cultured from nasal swab and endoscopic biopsy confirmed Aspergillus rhinosinusitis. After an initially good response to voriconazole and extensive debridement, she developed late intracranial hemorrhage and infarction with fatal outcome. This case stresses the importance of early suspicion and aggressive treatment of Aspergillus rhinosinusitis in patients with febrile neutropenia.",2009,19415022,no
"Protection by anti-beta-glucan antibodies is associated with restricted beta-1,3 glucan binding specificity and inhibition of fungal growth and adherence.","Anti-beta-glucan antibodies elicited by a laminarin-conjugate vaccine confer cross-protection to mice challenged with major fungal pathogens such as Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Cryptococcus neoformans. To gain insights into protective beta-glucan epitope(s) and protection mechanisms, we studied two anti-beta-glucan monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with identical complementarity-determining regions but different isotypes (mAb 2G8, IgG2b and mAb 1E12, IgM). C. albicans, the most relevant fungal pathogen for humans, was used as a model.Both mAbs bound to fungal cell surface and to the beta1,3-beta1,6 glucan of the fungal cell wall skeleton, as shown by immunofluorescence, electron-microscopy and ELISA. They were also equally unable to opsonize fungal cells in a J774 macrophage phagocytosis and killing assay. However, only the IgG2b conferred substantial protection against mucosal and systemic candidiasis in passive vaccination experiments in rodents. Competition ELISA and microarray analyses using sequence-defined glucan oligosaccharides showed that the protective IgG2b selectively bound to beta1,3-linked (laminarin-like) glucose sequences whereas the non-protective IgM bound to beta1,6- and beta1,4-linked glucose sequences in addition to beta1,3-linked ones. Only the protective IgG2b recognized heterogeneous, polydisperse high molecular weight cell wall and secretory components of the fungus, two of which were identified as the GPI-anchored cell wall proteins Als3 and Hyr1. In addition, only the IgG2b inhibited in vitro two critical virulence attributes of the fungus, hyphal growth and adherence to human epithelial cells.Our study demonstrates that the isotype of anti-beta-glucan antibodies may affect details of the beta-glucan epitopes recognized, and this may be associated with a differing ability to inhibit virulence attributes of the fungus and confer protection in vivo. Our data also suggest that the anti-virulence properties of the IgG2b mAb may be linked to its capacity to recognize beta-glucan epitope(s) on some cell wall components that exert critical functions in fungal cell wall structure and adherence to host cells.",2009,19399183,no
Fungal disease of the Western hemisphere: a patient with coccidioidomycosis.,"We report the case of a 58 year old male patient with nonproductive coughing, fever, vomiting and loss of appetite, beginning at the moment that he returned back home from a 2 week holiday in California. His symptoms were accompanied by increased inflammatory markers in his blood (leucocytosis, high CRP) and pulmonary sequelae, becoming more prominent shortly after admission. Eventually, the final diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis was made by histopathology and confirmed by serology. Coccidioidomycosis is a rare infectious disease. However, the incidence in the endemic areas of this fungal infection is increasing and the population travelling towards its specific endemic regions in the United States and Southern America is considerably growing. Clinicians facing patients with pulmonary infection with the appropriate travel history and persistent pulmonary or systemic infection (with or without eosinophilia) should be alert to the possibility of coccidioidomycosis. Therefore, we present an up to date overview of the epidemiology, microbiology, clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of patients with coccidioidomycosis.",2009,19393501,no
"The cell wall galactomannan antigen from Malassezia furfur and Malassezia pachydermatis contains beta-1,6-linked linear galactofuranosyl residues and its detection has diagnostic potential.","Lipophilic yeasts of the genus Malassezia are associated with several skin diseases, such as pityriasis versicolor, Malassezia folliculitis, seborrhoeic dermatitis and atopic dermatitis, and are also increasingly associated with catheter-related fungaemia. The cell wall components of pathogenic micro-organisms behave as an antigen and/or ligand of the innate immune response. Live cells of Malassezia furfur and Malassezia pachydermatis did not react with an anti-alpha-1,2-mannoside antibody. However, they showed a strong hydrophobicity and reactivity with an anti-beta-1,3-glucan antibody compared to those of C. albicans. The cell wall polysaccharides of M. furfur and M. pachydermatis were isolated and their structures analysed by (1)H and (13)C NMR experiments. Both polysaccharides were shown to be beta-1,6-linked linear galactofuranosyl polymers with a small amount of mannan. The presence of galactomannan on cells of Malassezia species has not been described previously. The galactomannan did not react with an anti-Aspergillus fumigatus monoclonal antibody which has specificity for beta-1,5-linked galactofuranosyl residues. An anti-M. furfur antibody strongly reacted with the galactomannans of M. furfur and M. pachydermatis, but did not react with the galactomannans of Trichophyton rubrum, A. fumigatus or Fonsecaea pedrosoi. The characteristics of the anti-M. furfur antibody suggest that there is potential for diagnosis of Malassezia infections by antigen detection.",2009,19389777,no
Approach to the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis and candidiasis.,"Detection of galactomannan antigen in serum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is useful for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis, but the current serologic tests are not useful. (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan can be detected in the serum of patients who have aspergillosis, candidiasis, and a few other mold infections, but false-positive results limit its reliability for diagnosis. None of these methods is useful for diagnosis of zygomycosis and certain other less common mold infections.

Application of galactomannan analysis and protein electrophoresis in the diagnosis of aspergillosis in avian species.,"Previous studies support the possible application of galactomannan, a major antigen of Aspergillus sp., to aspergillosis diagnosis in avian and other animal species. An assay is commercially available for use with human serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples. In the current study, galactomannan results from plasma samples were compared between birds with histologically confirmed aspergillosis and those that were clinically normal presumptively non-Aspergillus infected birds per submitting practitioners' responses to a questionnaire. It was observed that infected birds demonstrated a 2.6-fold increase in galactomannan over birds without evidence of aspergillosis. With the use of a galactomannan index of 0.5 as a cutoff, the sensitivity and specificity of the test were found to be 67% and 73%, respectively. In addition, plasma samples were analyzed for abnormalities in protein electrophoretic patterns. Infected birds had a higher incidence of increased beta and/or gamma globulin concentrations. Test sensitivity and specificity were 73% and 70%, respectively. If the 2 tests were used as a panel, then the sensitivity was 89% and specificity was 48%. These data indicate that both galactomannan and protein electrophoresis may be valuable tools in the diagnosis of avian aspergillosis.",2009,19368241,no
Molds and mycotoxin content of cereals in southeastern Romania.,"Fungal species and toxin contamination were determined in 110 cereal samples (54 maize, 35 wheat, and 21 barley) collected in the southeastern part of Romania from 2002 to 2004. The most frequent fungal contaminants belonged to Aspergillus and Fusarium, and maize was the most contaminated cereal. The main toxigenic species identified were Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Fusarium graminearum, and Fusarium culmorum in all cereals and Fusarium verticillioides in maize. The presence of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEA), fumonisins, and ochratoxin A was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. More than 90% of the samples were contaminated with at least one toxin. Around 30% of maize samples were contaminated with AFB1, and in 20% of these samples the level of toxin exceeded that allowed by European Union regulations. In 48 and 42% of samples, levels of DON and ZEA, respectively, exceeded those allowed by the European Union. Neither fumonisins nor ochratoxin A were found in samples from any year or cereal. These results indicate that cereals produced in Romania have a particular pattern of mycoflora and mycotoxin contamination because DON and ZEA in addition to AFB1 were found.",2009,19343960,no
Innate responses of corneal epithelial cells against Aspergillus fumigatus challenge.,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key components of the innate immune system that detects microbial infection and triggers host defensive responses. To determine the roles of TLR2 and TLR4 in corneal epithelial cells in mediating innate responses against Aspergillus fumigatus, telomerase-immortalized human corneal epithelial cells (THCE) were challenged by TLR2 ligand zymosan, TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide and A. fumigatus hyphae, respectively. Culture media were collected at different time points and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to detect the levels of inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and IL-6. We found that THCE responded to the challenge of TLR2 or TLR4 ligand by expressing and secreting inflammatory cytokines into the culture media. And exposure of THCE to A. fumigatus hyphae resulted in the upregulation of IL-1beta and IL-6. Treatment with TLR2- or TLR4-siRNA plasmid reduced TLR2 or TLR4 expression level in THCE when compared with controls, and caused a significant decrease in A. fumigatus-induced IL-1beta and IL-6 production. Our results suggested that THCE can respond to TLR2 and TLR4 ligand challenge by secreting IL-1beta and IL-6. They recognize A. fumigatus hyphae via TLR2 and TLR4 and initiate innate immune responses. Corneal epithelial cells play a role in innate defense against fungal infection through the mediation of inflammatory cytokines production.",2009,19341426,no
Invasive mold infections: recent advances in management approaches.,"An increasing number of patients are undergoing transplantation procedures or receiving aggressive immunosuppression and chemotherapy. The growing population of immunocompromised hosts has led to a rise in the prevalence of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) due to yeasts and molds. Recent trends suggest that patients are acquiring infections with non-Candida albicans species, non-Aspergillus fumigatus species and non-Aspergillus molds such as Fusarium species, Scedosporium species and Zygomycetes. There are also a few reports of resistance to standard azole and echinocandin therapy, and some Aspergillus (A. ustus, A. terreus) and Scedosporium species are inherently resistant to polyenes. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of mold infections are important to improve outcomes. The use of high-resolution computed tomography scanning and new diagnostic tools such as the galactomannan and beta-glucan tests help early detection of IFIs. With the changing epidemiology of fungal infections and emergence of rare pathogens, and with the availability of a larger number of antifungal drugs, new management strategies are evolving to effectively treat invasive mold infections.",2009,19337880,no
Tracking the emerging human pathogen Pseudallescheria boydii by using highly specific monoclonal antibodies.,"Pseudallescheria boydii has long been known to cause white grain mycetoma in immunocompetent humans, but it has recently emerged as an opportunistic pathogen of humans, causing potentially fatal invasive infections in immunocompromised individuals and evacuees of natural disasters, such as tsunamis and hurricanes. The diagnosis of P. boydii is problematic since it exhibits morphological characteristics similar to those of other hyaline fungi that cause infectious diseases, such as Aspergillus fumigatus and Scedosporium prolificans. This paper describes the development of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG1 kappa-light chain monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific to P. boydii and certain closely related fungi. The MAbs bind to an immunodominant carbohydrate epitope on an extracellular 120-kDa antigen present in the spore and hyphal cell walls of P. boydii and Scedosporium apiospermum. The MAbs do not react with S. prolificans, Scedosporium dehoogii, or a large number of clinically relevant fungi, including A. fumigatus, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Fusarium solani, and Rhizopus oryzae. The MAbs were used in immunofluorescence and double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (DAS-ELISAs) to accurately differentiate P. boydii from other infectious fungi and to track the pathogen in environmental samples. Specificity of the DAS-ELISA was confirmed by sequencing of the internally transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1)-5.8S-ITS2 rRNA-encoding regions of environmental isolates.",2009,19321690,no
Combination therapy in treatment of experimental pulmonary aspergillosis: in vitro and in vivo correlations of the concentration- and dose- dependent interactions between anidulafungin and voriconazole by Bliss independence drug interaction analysis.,"We studied the antifungal activity of anidulafungin (AFG) in combination with voriconazole (VRC) against experimental invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in persistently neutropenic rabbits and further explored the in vitro and in vivo correlations by using Bliss independence drug interaction analysis. Treatment groups consisted of those receiving AFG at 5 (AFG5 group) and 10 (AFG10 group) mg/kg of body weight/day, VRC at 10 mg/kg every 8 h (VRC group), AFG5 plus VRC (AFG5+VRC group), and AFG10 plus VRC (AFG10+VRC group) and untreated controls. Survival throughout the study was 60% for the AFG5+VRC group, 50% for the VRC group, 27% for the AFG10+VRC group, 22% for the AFG5 group, 18% for the AFG10 group, and 0% for control rabbits (P < 0.001). There was a significant reduction of organism-mediated pulmonary injury, measured by infarct scores, lung weights, residual fungal burdens, and galactomannan indexes, in AFG5+VRC-treated rabbits versus those treated with AFG5 and VRC alone (P < 0.05). In comparison, AFG10+VRC significantly lowered only infarct scores and lung weights in comparison to those of AFG10-treated animals (P < 0.05). AFG10+VRC showed no significant difference in other outcome variables. Significant Bliss synergy was found in vivo between AFG5 and VRC, with observed effects being 24 to 30% higher than expected levels if the drugs were acting independently. These synergistic interactions were also found between AFG and VRC in vitro. However, for AFG10+VRC, only independence and antagonism were observed among the outcome variables. We concluded that the combination of AFG with VRC in treatment of experimental IPA in persistently neutropenic rabbits was independent to synergistic at a dosage of 5 mg/kg/day but independent to antagonistic at 10 mg/kg/day, as assessed by Bliss independence analysis, suggesting that higher dosages of an echinocandin may be deleterious to the combination.",2009,19307368,no
Fungal infections after lung transplantation.,"Lung transplant's Achilles heel is chronic rejection. This is the reason why high immunosuppression is used, which leads to the development of infections. Fungal infections are a great obstacle in lung transplant patients' progress, not only because of their impact on patient survival, but also because fungal infections indirectly have an influence on the graft's progress. This review highlights the changing spectrum of invasive fungal infections as well as the most recent developments in diagnosis, prophylaxis, treatment and monitoring of lung transplantation.Fungal infections have a bimodal presentation: early onset, in relation to difficult postsurgeries and prior colonizations, and late onset, primarily in relation to chronic rejection and terminal renal insufficiency. The clinical impact of non-Aspergillus moulds is still unknown. Recent efforts have focused on nonculture-based methods to establish a rapid diagnosis. However, multicentre studies are needed to establish the diagnostic value of galactomannan antigen assay in invasive aspergillosis in lung transplantation. In addition, studies of the sensitivity and specificity of PCR assays are required to establish their diagnostic value. Unfortunately, only some advances in the diagnosis of aspergillosis have been achieved.Prophylaxis should be tailored according to the different individual patient's risk status. Combined treatments, including surgical therapy, may be useful in some patients.",2009,19305348,no
A case of disseminated histoplasmosis following autologous stem cell transplantation for Hodgkin's lymphoma: an initial misdiagnosis with a false-positive serum galactomannan assay.,Systemic histoplasmosis is uncommonly reported in patients who have undergone bone marrow or solid organ transplantation. Diagnosis of systemic histoplasmosis in recipients of transplants may be hampered by lack of consideration of this infection in the differential diagnosis and may be confounded by conflicting information from other testing performed to evaluate for opportunistic infections in this population. We report successful treatment of a case of disseminated histoplasmosis in a patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma who had undergone autologous stem cell transplantation. The diagnosis was delayed by the finding of a positive serum galactomannan assay.,2009,19302274,no
Early NK cell-derived IFN-{gamma} is essential to host defense in neutropenic invasive aspergillosis.,"Invasive aspergillosis is among the most common human fungal infections and occurs in patients with severe and complex defects in immune responses. NK cells have previously been found to be important in host defense against this infection, but the mechanism of this effect is not known. We hypothesized that NK cells mediate their protective effect in invasive aspergillosis by acting as the major source of IFN-gamma during early infection. We found that, in the lungs of neutropenic mice with invasive aspergillosis, NK cells were the major population of cells capable of generating IFN-gamma during early infection. Depletion of NK cells resulted in reduced lung IFN-gamma levels and increased lung fungal load that was independent of T and B cell subsets. Depletion of NK cells and absence of IFN-gamma resulted in a similar increase in susceptibility to the infection, but depletion of NK cells in IFN-gamma-deficient hosts did not result in further increase in severity of the infection. NK cell-derived IFN-gamma caused enhanced macrophage antimicrobial effects in vitro and also resulted in greater expression of IFN-inducible chemokines in the lungs. Finally, transfer of activated NK cells from wild-type, but not IFN-gamma-deficient hosts, resulted in greater pathogen clearance from the lungs of both IFN-gamma-deficient and wild-type recipients. Taken together, these data indicate that NK cells are the main source of early IFN-gamma in the lungs in neutropenic invasive aspergillosis, and this is an important mechanism in the defense against this infection.",2009,19299730,no
"Histoplasma capsulatum cell wall {beta}-glucan induces lipid body formation through CD18, TLR2, and dectin-1 receptors: correlation with leukotriene B4 generation and role in HIV-1 infection.","Histoplasma capsulatum (Hc) is a facultative, intracellular parasite of worldwide significance. Infection with Hc produces a broad spectrum of diseases and may progress to a life-threatening systemic disease, particularly in individuals with HIV infection. Resolution of histoplasmosis is associated with the activation of cell-mediated immunity, and leukotriene B(4) plays an important role in this event. Lipid bodies (LBs) are increasingly being recognized as multifunctional organelles with roles in inflammation and infection. In this study, we investigated LB formation in histoplasmosis and its putative function in innate immunity. LB formation in leukocytes harvested from Hc-infected C57BL/6 mice peaks on day 2 postinfection and correlates with enhanced generation of lipid mediators, including leukotriene B(4) and PGE(2). Pretreatment of leukocytes with platelet-activating factor and BLT1 receptor antagonists showed that both lipid mediators are involved in cell signaling for LB formation. Alveolar leukocytes cultured with live or dead Hc also presented an increase in LB numbers. The yeast alkali-insoluble fraction 1, which contains mainly beta-glucan isolated from the Hc cell wall, induced a dose- and time-dependent increase in LB numbers, indicating that beta-glucan plays a signaling role in LB formation. In agreement with this hypothesis, beta-glucan-elicited LB formation was inhibited in leukocytes from 5-LO(-/-), CD18(low) and TLR2(-/-) mice, as well as in leukocytes pretreated with anti-Dectin-1 Ab. Interestingly, human monocytes from HIV-1-infected patients failed to produce LBs after beta-glucan stimulation. These results demonstrate that Hc induces LB formation, an event correlated with eicosanoid production, and suggest a role for these lipid-enriched organelles in host defense during fungal infection.",2009,19299700,no
"Empirical versus preemptive antifungal therapy for high-risk, febrile, neutropenic patients: a randomized, controlled trial.","Empirical antifungal therapy is the standard of care for neutropenic patients with hematological malignancies who remain febrile despite broad-spectrum antibacterial treatment. Recent diagnostic improvements may ensure the early diagnosis of potentially invasive fungal disease. Reserving antifungals for this stage may achieve similar survival rates and reduce treatment toxicity and costs.In this multicenter, open-label, randomized noninferiority trial, we compared an empirical antifungal strategy with a preemptive one. Empirical treatment was defined as antibacterial treatment of patients who have persistent or recurrent fever. Preemptive treatment was defined as treatment of patients who have clinical, imaging, or galactomannan-antigen-assay evidence suggesting fungal disease. First-line antifungal treatment was amphotericin B deoxycholate (1 mg/kg/day) or liposomal amphotericin (3 mg/kg/day), depending on daily renal function. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients alive at 14 days after recovery from neutropenia.The median duration of neutropenia (neutrophil count, <500 cells/mm3) for the 293 patients enrolled was 18 days (range, 5-69 days). By intention-to-treat analysis, survival was 97.3% with empirical treatment and 95.1% with preemptive treatment. The lower 95% confidence limit for the difference in mortality was -5.9%, which was within the noninferiority margin of -8%. Probable or proven invasive fungal infections were more common among patients who received preemptive treatment than among patients who received empirical treatment (13 of 143 vs. 4 of 150 P < .05), and most infections occurred during induction therapy (12 of 73 patients in the preemptive treatment group vs. 3 of 78 patients in the empirical treatment group were infected during induction therapyPreemptive treatment increased the incidence of invasive fungal disease, without increasing mortality, and decreased the costs of antifungal drugs. Empirical treatment may provide better survival rates for patients receiving induction chemotherapy.",2009,19281327,no
New therapies for fungal pneumonia.,"This review summarizes recent developments in the diagnosis and treatment of fungal pneumonia, with an emphasis on invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.Improvements in nonculture-based fungal diagnostics, early implementation of pulmonary high resolution, or spiral computed tomography scanning and a recent expansion of the antifungal armamentarium have greatly improved the outcome of immunocompromised patients with invasive aspergillosis. However, the field is changing: new pathogens (such as Zygomycetes) are emerging, and novel risk groups (ICU patients in particular) are being identified.Galactomannan antigen detection is a valuable tool for evaluating patients at risk for invasive aspergillosis (as a screening assay on serum samples from neutropenic patients or as a confirmatory assay on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples, in general), but should be used in conjunction with modern imaging techniques. beta-D-Glucan and PCR assays are still investigational. Voriconazole is the drug of choice for invasive aspergillosis, whereas liposomal amphotericin B at 3 mg/kg per day is the preferred alternative in case of contraindication, drug-related side-effects, or intolerance. Whenever possible, optimal antifungal therapy should be complemented by surgical debridement of necrotic tissue. The added value of combination therapy is still unproven. Therapeutic drug monitoring of mold-active azoles should be implemented in order to minimize toxicity and maximize efficacy. Lipid-based formulations of amphotericin B, and to a lesser extent voriconazole, are the drugs of choice for non-Aspergillus related fungal pneumonia. Although active in prophylaxis, the efficacy of posaconazole in confirmed infections remains controversial.",2009,19276884,no
Phaeohyphomycosis in a tertiary care cancer center.,"Phaeohyphomycosis is a rare opportunistic fungal infection. To assess the range of clinical presentations and outcomes of phaeohyphomycosis in patients with cancer, we reviewed cases diagnosed at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX).We searched the microbiology laboratory records for dematiaceous molds that had been isolated during the period from January 1989 through March 2008. Demographic and clinical data were abstracted from patients' medical records. Invasive phaeohyphomycosis was defined according to the criteria of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycosis Study Group for proven or probable invasive fungal disease. Archived dematiaceous mold isolates were tested for antifungal drug susceptibility.Of 348 isolates of dematiaceous fungi recovered, only 39 isolates (11%), recovered from 39 patients, were associated with proven or probable invasive fungal disease (33 proven and 6 probable). The incidence rate of phaeohyphomycosis increased from 1.0 to 3.1 cases per 100,000 patient-days during the study period (P = .006). Of these 39 patients, 14 (36%) had a breakthrough infection while receiving prophylactic or empirical antifungal therapy. Sites of infection were the lungs (15 [38%] of 39 patients), skin (15 [38%]), sinuses (14 [36%]), and bloodstream (7 [18%]). Thirteen patients (33%) had a disseminated infection. Values of the serum galactomannan index were measured for 11 (28%) of 39 patients. The galactomannan index value was elevated (>0.5) in 5 (45%) of these 11 patients. The mortality rate at 12 weeks was 33%. Cox regression analysis revealed a significantly higher risk of death for patients with disseminated infection (hazard ratio, 5.7 P = .03) and a lower risk for patients who recovered from neutropenia within 30 days (hazard ratio, 0.2Although rare, dematiaceous molds are increasingly encountered in immunosuppressed patients with cancer. The propensity of these fungi for dissemination and for resistance to antifungal drugs presents management challenges.",2009,19267655,no
Paradoxical echinocandin activity: a limited in vitro phenomenon?,"The echinocandins have been a welcome addition for the treatment of invasive fungal infections. Despite their excellent safety profile and clinical efficacy, concerns exist regarding an attenuation of activity at higher concentrations, known as the paradoxical effect. In vitro studies have reported this phenomenon against both Candida and Aspergillus species. Recent data have also demonstrated this effect to be species-related and echinocandin specific. Although not completely understood, studies have pointed towards involvement of the protein kinase C cell wall integrity pathway as well as increases in cell wall chitin content as potential mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon. Increases in galactomannan have been reported in vitro and in vivo following echinocandin exposure. Although some in vivo studies of invasive aspergillosis have also reported a paradoxical increase in other markers of invasive disease and fungal burden with echinocandin therapy, these observations are inconsistent. The paradoxical effect has also not been demonstrated clinically. Thus, the clinical implications of the paradoxical attenuation of echinocandin activity at elevated concentrations remain unknown. A complete understanding of this effect may further our knowledge of fungal responses to echinocandin cell wall damage and potentially improve treatment strategies.",2009,19255904,no
Diagnostic imaging of experimental invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.,"Pulmonary infiltrates in neutropenic hosts with invasive aspergillosis are caused by organism-mediated tissue injury, vascular invasion, and hemorrhagic infarction. Ultrafast computed tomography (UFCT) scanning reproducibly measures these lesions in experimental invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in persistently neutropenic rabbits. The pulmonary lesion score from UFCT scanning is a useful outcome variable for measuring differences in efficacy of antifungal compounds alone and in combination, as well as the virulence of different strains and species of Aspergillus. Several studies demonstrate that the course of pulmonary lesions treated with amphotericin B, lipid formulations of amphotericin B, triazoles, echinocandins, and combination therapy measured by serial UFCT scans correlate with those measured by survival, histopathological resolution of lesions, microbiological clearance of Aspergillus fumigatus, and resolution of galactomannan index. We further developed a multidimensional volumetric imaging (MDVI) method for analysis of the volume of pulmonary infiltrates over time in response to antifungal therapy. Volumetric data by MDVI correlate with UFCT pulmonary lesion scores and validated biological endpoints. A recent pilot clinical study demonstrated the applicability of MDVI to human pulmonary fungal infections. MDVI also improves objectivity of radiological assessment of therapeutic response to antifungal therapy and merits more extensive evaluation in patients with invasive aspergillosis, as well as other fungal and bacterial pneumonias.",2009,19253145,no
Risk stratification for invasive aspergillosis: early assessment of host susceptibility.,"Outcomes of invasive aspergillosis are substantially improved with early initiation of therapy. Unfortunately, the diagnosis remains difficult to establish so that early suspicion of infection is imperative. Identification of high risk patients and use of non-culture-based diagnostics and radiographic studies can facilitate earlier recognition of infection. It is important to realize that the timing and spectrum of risk for invasive aspergillosis have expanded. While patients with hematological malignancies and hematopoietic stem cell transplants make up the highest risk groups, patients such as those receiving steroids and other immunosuppressive therapies are also at risk. Non-culture-based methods (including galactomannan, 1,3-beta-D-glucan, and PCR-based methods) are actively being pursued to improve early diagnosis. Thus, identifying patients at high risk for infection and utilizing non-culture-based methods and radiologic studies to assist in establishing a likely diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis will further enhance the role of new agents in the early, effective treatment and prophylaxis of invasive aspergillosis.",2009,19253143,no
Recognizing therapeutic failure.,"Cases are presented that raise the issue of how to recognize treatment failure, including radiologic, serologic, and/or clinical definitions with special attention to assessment when available information is conflicting or ambiguous. Just as the diagnosis of invasive aspergillus (IA) remains difficult to secure for many patients, so too is the assessment of a patient for possible treatment failure. Specifically the absence of a sensitive surrogate marker to monitor response leaves clinicians with several insensitive, non-specific and often conflicting pieces of information. For example, CT evidence of response is well-described to lag at least a week behind patient improvement and so this modality cannot be relied upon to assess daily or even weekly patient response. The clinical assessment of the patient is complicated by the presence or absence of neutropenia since patients may appear to worsen as their neutropenia recovers conversely, patients with advanced infection may exhibit only subtle signs of IA if profoundly immunosuppressed. Finally, IA does not respond to any antifungal quickly",2009,19247870,no
The role of bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan in the diagnosis of pediatric invasive aspergillosis.,": Molecular biomarkers such as the galactomannan assay are of increasing interest in clinical settings for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA). The use of bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan (BAL GM) is being validated in adult populations, but has not been systematically evaluated in pediatric patients.: A retrospective analysis was performed of patients for whom GM assays from BAL were submitted between November 1, 2006 and November14, 2007 at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles. Medical charts were reviewed and patients were categorized as having no, possible, probable, and proven IA, per established definitions.: Of 85 pediatric patients who had a BAL GM submitted during the study, 59 were immunocompromised. Three patients were identified as having proven IA, 6 had probable IA, 37 had possible IA, and 39 had no evidence of IA 38 had a concurrent serum GM performed. A positive, linear correlation was established between BAL and serum GM, using OD index values (rho = 0.48, P = 0.002). Among immunocompromised patients, receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated an optimal BAL GM OD cut-off value of 0.87, that yielded a sensitivity for probable/proven IA of 78% and a specificity of 100%. At 0.87, the positive and negative predictive values among immunocompromised patients were 58% and 96%, respectively.: We found a correlation between BAL GM values and a diagnosis of IA. We also noted a linear relationship between serum and BAL GM values. Receiver operating characteristic curves obtained from our pediatric data validate the current cut off for serum and suggest a possible cut off for BAL specimens.",2009,19238113,no
Combination therapy of advanced invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in transiently neutropenic rats using human pharmacokinetic equivalent doses of voriconazole and anidulafungin.,"At present, voriconazole (VOR) is the drug of first choice for treating invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). However, particularly in advanced stages of disease and in the severely immunocompromised host, the mortality remains substantial. The combination of VOR with an echinocandin may improve the therapeutic outcome. We investigate here whether combining VOR and anidulafungin (ANI) in advanced IPA in transiently neutropenic rats results in a higher therapeutic efficacy. Since VOR is metabolized more rapidly in rodents than in humans, dosage adjustment for VOR is necessary to obtain an area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) in rodents that is equivalent to that of humans. In this study, the pharmacokinetics of VOR and ANI in rats were elucidated, and dosage schedules were applied that produced AUCs similar to those of humans. The developed dose schedules were well tolerated by the rats, without effects on renal and hepatic functions. VOR showed excellent efficacy in early IPA (100% rat survival). In advanced IPA, VOR was less efficacious (50% rat survival), whereas a significant decrease in galactomannan concentrations in lungs and sera was found in surviving rats. ANI administered in advanced IPA resulted in 22% rat survival, and the serum concentrations of fungal galactomannan were slightly but not significantly decreased. The addition of ANI to VOR did not result in significantly increased therapeutic efficacy in advanced IPA, resulting in 67% rat survival and a significant decrease in galactomannan concentration in serum. In conclusion, VOR monotherapy is therapeutically effective in the treatment of advanced-stage IPA and superior to the use of ANI. Combining both agents does not significantly improve the therapeutic outcome.",2009,19237647,no
"Development and characterization of oral lipid-based amphotericin B formulations with enhanced drug solubility, stability and antifungal activity in rats infected with Aspergillus fumigatus or Candida albicans.","To develop an oral formulation of Amphotericin B (AmpB) with: (A) medium chain triglycerides, fatty acids and nonionic surfactants as a self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS) or (B) glyceryl mono-oleate (Peceol) with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-phospholipids.SEDDS formulations were prepared by simple mixing at 40 degrees C. Peceol/DSPE-PEG-lipid formulations were prepared by solvent evaporation. Parameters evaluated included: miscibility, solubility and emulsion droplet size after incubation in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) or simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) via dynamic light scattering. The stability of AmpB in Peceol/DSPE-PEG was evaluated in SGF and SIF. Phase stability of AmpB in Peceol+/-DSPE-PEG following thermal cycling was evaluated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Aspergillus fumigatus (2.9-3.45 x 10(7) colony forming units per mL [CFU]) or Candida albicans (3-3.65 x 10(6) CFU per mL) were injected via the jugular vein 48 h later male albino Sprague-Dawley rats (350-400 g) were administered either a single oral gavage of a Peceol-DSPE/PEG2000-based AmpB (10 mg AmpB/kg and 5 mg AmpB/kg for the Candida albicans study only) twice daily for 2 consecutive days, a single intravenous (i.v.) dose of Abelcet (5mg AmpB/kg), or physiologic saline (non-treated controlsMean diameter of SEDDS after 30 min in 150 mM NaCl at 37 degrees C was 200-400 nm. However, the Peceol/DSPE-PEG, where PEG MW was 350, 550, 750 or 2000, showed a greater solubilization of AmpB (5 mg/mL) compared to SEDDS formulations (100-500 microg/mL). Upon dispersion in SIF, Peceol/DSPE-PEG formulations generated submicron emulsion particle sizes varying slightly with PEG MW. Stability of the AmpB in Peceol/DSPE-PEG formulations in SGF or SIF was >80% after 2 h, and best for formulations containing DSPE-PEG 750 or 2000 compared to 350, 550 or Peceol only. Monoglyceride-Peceol-DSPE/PEG2000-based oral AmpB treatment significantly decreased total fungal CFU concentrations recovered in all the organs added together by >80% compared to non-treated controls without significant changes in plasma creatinine levels in the A. fumigatus infected rats. In addition, this formulation significantly decreased kidney fungal CFU concentrations by >75% at the 5 mg/kg dose and by >95% at the 10 mg/kg dose compared to non-treated controls without significant changes in the plasma creatinine levels in the Candida albicans-infected rats.Novel lipid-based AmpB oral formulations were prepared that provide excellent drug solubilization, drug stability in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids and antifungal activity without renal toxicity in rats infected with A. fumigatus and C. albicans.",2010,19236839,no
Functional expression and sub-cellular localization of the early aflatoxin pathway enzyme Nor-1 in Aspergillus parasiticus.,"Aflatoxin biosynthesis in Aspergillus parasiticus requires at least 17 enzyme activities (from acetate). Although the activities of most aflatoxin biosynthetic enzymes have been established, the mechanisms that govern transport and sub-cellular localization of these enzymes are not clear. We developed plasmid constructs that express Nor-1 fused to a green fluorescent protein reporter (EGFP) to monitor transport and localization of this early pathway enzyme in real time in Aspergillus parasiticus. Plasmids expressing EGFP fused to Nor-1 were introduced into A. parasiticus B62 (carries non-functional Nor-1). Transformants were screened for increased aflatoxin accumulation (restored Nor-1 activity) on coconut agar medium and for EGFP expression using fluorescence microscopy. Increased aflatoxin accumulation was confirmed by TLC and ELISA. Nor-1 fused to EGFP at either the N- or C- terminus functionally complemented non-functional Nor-1 in B62 and increased aflatoxin synthesis to wild-type (N-terminus) or lower levels (C-terminus). We detected full-length Nor-1 fusion proteins in transformants with increased aflatoxin accumulation (Western blot) and determined that the expression plasmid integrated at the nor-1 locus in these cells (Southern blot). Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) demonstrated that Nor-1 fusion proteins localized in the cytoplasm and vacuoles of fungal hyphae grown on aflatoxin-inducing solid media for 48h control EGFP (no Nor-1) did not localize to vacuoles until 72h. The highest rate of aflatoxin synthesis coincided with the highest rate of transport of Nor-1 fusion proteins to the vacuole strongly suggesting that Nor-1 is synthesized in the cytoplasm and transported to the vacuole to carry out an early step in aflatoxin synthesis.",2010,19217941,no
Invasive aspergillosis in two liver transplant recipients: diagnosis by SeptiFast.,"We report the clinical features, diagnosis, and monitoring findings of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in 2 liver transplant recipients. Blood/serum samples and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids were analyzed by a novel commercial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (SeptiFast) and an Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA). The diagnosis of IA could be performed in <6 h with the detection of Aspergillus fumigatus DNA in blood and BAL fluid. High GM values (mean: 9.1, range: 7.3-10.8) in serum and BAL fluid confirmed the SeptiFast result. Follow-up of the SeptiFast findings and GM index correlated with the clinical course. The molecular detection of A. fumigatus-specific DNA and GM test in blood/serum and BAL samples appears to be a useful tool for prompt diagnosis of IA. Further prospective clinical trials are necessary to evaluate the accuracy of SeptiFast and the GM test in diagnosing IA.",2009,19210691,no
Inducible expression of beta defensins by human respiratory epithelial cells exposed to Aspergillus fumigatus organisms.,"Aspergillus fumigatus, a saprophytic mould, is responsible for life-threatening, invasive pulmonary diseases in immunocompromised hosts. The role of the airway epithelium involves a complex interaction with the inhaled pathogen. Antimicrobial peptides with direct antifungal and chemotactic activities may boost antifungal immune response.The inducible expression of defensins by human bronchial epithelial 16HBE cells and A549 pneumocyte cells exposed to A. fumigatus was investigated. Using RT-PCR and real time PCR, we showed an activation of hBD2 and hBD9 defensin genes: the expression was higher in cells exposed to swollen conidia (SC), compared to resting conidia (RC) or hyphal fragments (HF). The kinetics of defensin expression was different for each one, evoking a putative distinct function for each investigated defensin. The decrease of defensin expression in the presence of heat-inactivated serum indicated a possible link between defensins and the proteins of the host complement system. The presence of defensin peptide hBD2 was revealed using immunofluorescence that showed a punctual cytoplasmic and perinuclear staining. Quantification of the cells stained with anti hBD2 antibody demonstrated that SC induced a greater number of cells that synthesized hBD2, compared to RC or HF. Labelling of the cells with anti-hBD-2 antibody showed a positive immunofluorescence signal around RC or SC in contrast to HF. This suggests co-localisation of hBD2 and digested conidia. The HBD2 level was highest in the supernatants of cells exposed to SC, as was determined by sandwich ELISA. Experiments using neutralising anti-interleukine-1beta antibody reflect the autocrine mechanism of defensin expression induced by SC. Investigation of defensin expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels demonstrated the requirement of transcription as well as new protein synthesis during A. fumigatus defensin induction. Finally, induced defensin expression in primary culture of human respiratory cells exposed to A. fumigatus points to the biological significance of described phenomena.Our findings provide evidence that respiratory epithelium might play an important role in the immune response during Aspergillus infection. Understanding the mechanisms of regulation of defensin expression may thus lead to new approaches that could enhance expression of antimicrobial peptides for potential therapeutic use during aspergillosis treatment.",2009,19208266,no
"IgE influences the number and function of mature mast cells, but not progenitor recruitment in allergic pulmonary inflammation.","Studies performed using cultured cells indicate that IgE functions not only to trigger degranulation of mast cells following allergen exposure, but also to enhance their survival. Such an influence of IgE on mast cell homeostasis during allergic responses in vivo has not been established. In this study, we show that inhalation of Aspergillus fumigatus extract in mice induced a dramatic rise in IgE accompanied by an increase in airway mast cells. These had an activated phenotype with high levels of FcepsilonRI. Plasma mast cell protease-1 was also increased, indicating an elevated systemic mast cell load. In addition, enhanced levels of IL-5 and eosinophils were observed in the airway. Both mast cell expansion and activation were markedly attenuated in IgE(-/-) animals that are incapable of producing IgE in response to A. fumigatus. The recruitment of eosinophils to the airways was also reduced in IgE(-/-) mice. Analyses of potential cellular targets of IgE revealed that IgE Abs are not required for the induction of mast cell progenitors in response to allergen, but rather act by sustaining the survival of mature mast cells. Our results identify an important role for IgE Abs in promoting mast cell expansion during allergic responses in vivo.",2009,19201896,no
[Evaluation of galactomannan antigen and beta-D-glucan value for diagnosis of chronic necrotizing pulmomary aspergillosis].,"In order to establish the reliable cut-off value of galactomannan (GM) antigen as well as that for beta-D-glucan for CNPA diagnosis, we conducted the following study. From 2001 to 2008, in a total of 1511 patients we measured GM and anti-aspergillus antibody simultaneously. These patients had chronic pulmonary disease including old tuberculosis, nontuberculous mycobacteriosis, COPD, and had bullous lung, interstitial lung disease or were suspected to have suspected to have interstitial lung disease. We designated cases as probable CNPA when the sample represented a positive anti-aspergillus antibody. We then analyzed the sensitivity and specificity according to various GM antigen values. When using the GM antigen cut-off value at 0.5, the sensitivity and specificity for CNPA were 63.4% and 68.6% respectively. Using 1.0 for cut-off value resulted in the better specificity for CNPA diagnosis. Similar analysis was performed on beta-D-glucan for CNPA diagnosis. When using D-glucan cut-off value as 20 pg/ml, the sensitivity and specificity for CNPA. These results indicate that the cut-off value of serological examination for infectious disease should be considered by the type of disease.",2009,19198228,no
Rapid decrease of anti-beta-glucan antibody as an indicator for early diagnosis of carinii pneumonitis and deep mycotic infections following immunosuppressive therapy in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis.,"Deep mycosis (aspergillus pneumonia (AsP)) and carinii pneumonitis (PCP) are complications of immunosuppressive treatment for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV). The objective was to clarify the clinical significance of plasma titer of antibody against beta-glucans (anti-BG antibody) as a predictor of complications such as AsP or PCP and the prognosis of patients. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the plasma titer of antibodies against beta-glucans (BG) from Candida albicans in 22 healthy subjects and 52 patients with various stages of AAV. The mean plasma titer of the anti-BG antibody was 2,677 +/- 1,686 U in healthy subjects, 691 +/- 522 U in patients with untreated active vasculitis (n = 14), and 547 +/- 416 U in patients soon after immunosuppressive treatment (n = 24). Healthy subjects had significantly higher antibody titers than the other two groups (P < 0.05). Repeated measurements over the clinical course of AAV revealed an increase during remission to 1,180 +/- 130 U (n = 11), while there was a significant rapid decrease to 369 +/- 441 U (P < 0.01) concomitantly with elevation in plasma C-reactive protein and BG levels in patients with AAV that had AsP or PCP infection. Antifungal therapy resulted in a rapid rise of anti-BG antibody titer. Experiments in mice suggested that the anti-BG antibody neutralizes BG. Rapid decrease of the anti-BG antibody titer may be a useful indicator for diagnosis of the presence of AsP or PCP and for estimating the prognosis of patients with these opportunistic infections during immunosuppressive treatment of AAV.",2009,19190977,no
Value of a single galactomannan determination (Platelia) for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in non-hematological patients with clinical isolation of Aspergillus spp.,"We studied 75 patients with non-hematological conditions from whom Aspergillus spp. were recovered from clinical specimens during the period March 2003 to August 2006. The patients were classified according to EORTC criteria and the presence of galactomannan (Platelia Aspergillus) in their sera was evaluated. Ten of these patients (13.3%) had proven or probable invasive aspergillosis, i.e., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in five (50%), HIV infection in one (10%), lymphoma in one (10%), liver transplant in one (10%), solid malignancies in one (10%), and corticosteroid treatment in one (10%). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for the detection of galactomannan, using cut-offs of > or =0.5 ng/ml and > or =1 ng/ml were 60%/50%, 89.23%/100%, 46.15%/100%, and 93.55%/92.86% (p=0.001 and p<0.001), respectively. The determination of galactomannan in the sera of non-neutropenic patients could prove to be a useful microbiological finding when diagnosing invasive aspergillosis.",2009,19180751,no
Occurrence of aflatoxins in mahua (Madhuca indica Gmel.) seeds: synergistic effect of plant extracts on inhibition of Aspergillus flavus growth and aflatoxin production.,"Occurrence of aflatoxin in Madhuca indica Gmel. seeds was determined by competitive ELISA. Eighty percent of mahua seed samples were found to be contaminated with aflatoxin. Total aflatoxin content ranged from 115.35 to 400.54ppb whereas the concentration of AFB(1) was in the range of 86.43 to 382.45ppb. Mahua oil was extracted by cold press expeller and analysed for contamination of aflatoxin in both the oil and cake samples. Total aflatoxin and aflatoxin B(1) were 220.66 and 201.57ppb in oil as compared to that in cake samples where it was 87.55 and 74.35ppb, respectively. Various individual and combined plant extracts were evaluated for their efficacy against growth of Aspergillus flavus and aflatoxin production in vitro. Combination of botanicals were found to be more effective in controlling fungal growth and aflatoxin production than individual extracts. Results of the present study suggests that synergistic effect of plant extracts can be used for control of fungal growth and aflatoxin production. These natural plant products may successfully replace synthetic chemicals and provide an alternative method to protect mahua as well as other agricultural commodities of nutritional significance from toxigenic fungi such as A. flavus and aflatoxin production.",2009,19167450,no
False-positive results of Aspergillus galactomannan antigenemia in liver transplant recipients.,"Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) antigenemia is an early marker of invasive aspergillosis (IA), but may yield false-positive results. A prospective study, testing GM periodically in serum samples of liver transplant recipients, was performed.An index more than or equal to 0.5 were considered positive. Positive GM in samples from patients without any other criteria of proven or probable IA was considered as false-positive. The test was performed weekly during the first month after transplantation.Three patients developed IA. In total, 414 serum samples from 85 liver transplant recipients were analyzed. Mean number of samples per patient (out of those who could be assessed) was 4.8. The number of false-positive GM samples was 40 (9.6%), corresponding to 28 patients. The frequency of false-positive results in samples obtained during the first week posttransplantation was 36% (27 of 75), significantly higher than the number of false-positive samples obtained after the first week (3.8% 13 of 339The present study suggests that the administration of ampicillin as antibacterial prophylaxis during the first days after transplantation could be a possible cause of false-positive GM results.",2009,19155981,no
Correlation between galactomannan antigen levels in serum and neutrophil counts in haematological patients with invasive aspergillosis.,"The detection of circulating galactomannan (GM) in serum samples is an important step in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA). The assay has been mainly explored in neutropenic patients, and is now used to monitor patients at high risk for IA. However, the performance of the assay varies greatly among studies. The objective of this study was to explore the impact of the neutrophil count on the GM serum index at the time of IA diagnosis. Ninety-nine episodes of proven or probable, microbiologically documented IA in 91 patients with haematological malignancies were studied retrospectively. Three groups were identified: groups 1-3, with <100 polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN)/mm(3) (n = 18), between 100 and 500 PMN/mm(3) (n = 21), or >500 PMN/mm(3) (n = 60), respectively. The mean GM index was significantly higher in group 1 than in the other groups (p <0.05). This finding did not change after stratifying the analysis with regard to the use of antibiotics likely to give false-positive GM results or with regard to treatment effective against fungi before the diagnosis of IA. This finding could be considered in the routine use of the GM antigenaemia test in non-neutropenic patients a negative result or a low GM index should not eliminate the diagnosis of IA. This limitation calls for other microbiological tests, including analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, to establish a definitive diagnosis of IA.",2009,19154482,no
[A clinical study of 49 cases of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis].,"Studying the proven and probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) cases of some hospitals in Shanghai to provide evidence for the improvement of IPA clinical diagnosis and therapy.Forty-nine IPA cases were retrospectively analyzed for demography data, host factors, underlying conditions, chest CT, microorganism and histopathology examination, as well as therapy and clinical outcome.Of 49 subjects including 19 (38.8%) proven and 30 (61.2%) probable IPA, 3 patients (6.1%) had no host factors, 25 patients (51.0%) had IPA associated host factors and underlying conditions, while 21 patients (42.9%) had uncertain fundamental diseases. Chest CT evaluation demonstrated that radiological lesions include nodules in 29 patients, patching in 15, mass in 12, consolidation in 10, cavitation in 34, Halo sign in 19, air bronchogram in 18, crescentic sign in 6, bilateral in 33 and multifocal lesions in 38. The yielding rate of fungus culture in sputum was 26.5% (13/49), and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was 66.7% (10/15). Eleven of thirty-six patients (30.6%) had positive results of serum galactomannan antigen tests. Nineteen of twenty-one patients (90.5%) were proven as IPA by lung histologic examinations. Aspergillus fumigatus was the most common pathogen 81.0% (17/21). The responding rate to initial anti-fungus therapy was 50% (21/42).Our study suggests that in IPA patients, bilateral, multifocal and nodular lesion could be the most common radiological characteristic, while Halo and crescentic sign occur occasionally. Invasive technologies are more valuable to IPA diagnosis.",2009,19134308,no
A novel monoclonal antibody recognizing beta(1-3) glucans in intact cells of Candida and Cryptococcus.,"The cell walls of all medically important fungi contain a unique polyglucose compound, beta(1-3) glucan. In the present study, murine monoclonal antibodies were produced against linear and beta(1-6) branched beta(1-3) glucans, and their specificities were characterized for reactivity to other beta glucans, fungal cell wall fragments, and fungal cells. Their reactivity was also compared with that of rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the same immunogens. Two mouse monoclonal antibodies (AG and BG) recognized immunoreactive epitopes in beta(1-3)(1-6) glucan by ELISA. In an inhibition assay of the anti-beta(1-3)(1-6) activity of the monoclonals, the homologous antigen effectively inhibited the activity as expected, while beta(1-3) also inhibited the assay but to a much lesser extent. No inhibition was obtained by beta(1-3)(1-4) or beta(1-6), while a cell wall extract of Candida albicans (PPM) effectively inhibited both monoclonals. Cell wall fragments of C. albicans (CaCW) and Cryptococcus neoformans (CnCW) inhibited the anti-beta(1-3)(1-6) activity of AG, while BG was much less or not inhibited at all. Immunofluorescence confirmed the unique antibody specificity of AG by its recognition of a beta(1-3)(1-6)-associated epitope on the cell surfaces of C. albicans,C. krusei, C. glabrata, and nonencapsulated C. neoformans. The epitope for the AG antibody is suggested to be present in the branching point of beta(1-3)(1-6), or in the randomly coiled beta(1-3) polyglucan due to the presence of branches. Thus, monoclonal antibodies to beta(1-3)(1-6) glucans may have potential as tools in the laboratory diagnosis of invasive yeast infections.",2009,19132980,no
Effects of conidia of various Aspergillus species on apoptosis of human pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells.,"Aspergillus species can cause mycoses in human and animals. Previously, we demonstrated that A. fumigatus conidia from a human isolate inhibited apoptosis in human pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells. In the current study, we studied the effects of A. fumigatus conidia non-human origin and A. flavus, A. nidulans, A. niger and A. oryzae conidia on human cells apoptosis. Human pneumocytes or bronchial epithelial cells were simultaneously exposed to apoptotic inductors and aspergilli conidia. The cell cultures were analyzed by flow cytometry, immunoblotting, and examination of nuclear morphology. Similar to A. fumigatus conidia, A. flavus conidia inhibited cellular apoptosis while A. nidulans, A. niger and A. oryzae conidia did not affect apoptosis. We further studied the species specificity of conidia: there were no differences in the inhibition of apoptosis by A. fumigatus conidia from either human or bird isolates. In order to determine whether the inhibition of apoptosis by conidia is limited to certain strains, the effect on human cell apoptosis of different A. fumigatus human clinical isolates and A. fumigatus of environmental origin was evaluated. All A. fumigatus isolates inhibited apoptosis an anti-apoptotic factor was released by conidia. For TNF-induced apoptosis, the anti-apoptotic effect of conidia of all isolates was found to be associated with a reduction of caspase-3 in human cells. The results suggest that suppression of apoptosis may play a role in reducing the efficacy of host defense mechanisms during infection with Aspergillus species.",2009,19117118,no
Galactomannan serves as a surrogate endpoint for outcome of pulmonary invasive aspergillosis in neutropenic hematology patients.,"A noninvasive, objective, reproducible, and quantitative Aspergillus-specific surrogate marker is needed for a more accurate assessment of the outcome of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in patients with a hematologic disorder. The quantitative serum galactomannan index (GMI) assay seems to fulfill the requirements of surrogacy for outcome evaluation.Kappa statistics were used to determine the strength of correlation between GMI outcome and clinical outcome (survival or death), autopsy data, and response outcome of IA in 70 adults with prolonged neutropenia. All patients underwent serial GMI monitoring until discharge or death.The overall correlation between GMI and clinical outcome was good at 6 weeks (kappa=0.5882 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.4023-0.7741) and was excellent at 12 weeks (kappa=0.8857In neutropenic patients with seropositive IA, serum galactomannan index outcome strongly correlates with survival, autopsy findings, and response outcome. This finding may have implications for patient management and for clinical trial design.",2009,19117035,no
Value of serial quantification of fungal DNA by a real-time PCR-based technique for early diagnosis of invasive Aspergillosis in patients with febrile neutropenia.,"A study was designed to assess the reliability of the serial detection of Aspergillus sp. DNA to diagnose invasive aspergillosis (IA) in patients with febrile neutropenia. Two blood and two serum samples were taken weekly from 83 patients. A total of 2,244 samples were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. Twelve (14.4%) patients were diagnosed with IA. Taking two consecutive positive results as the diagnostic criterion, PCR detected 11 cases, with 4 false positives, giving sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values of 91.6%, 94.4%, 73.3%, and 98.5%, respectively. On analyzing in conjunction with high-resolution chest tomography (HRCT) and galactomannan (GM) testing, the combination of serial PCR and GM detected 100% of aspergillosis cases, with a positive predictive value of 75.1%. This diagnostic strategy presented, according to CART analysis, a receiver-operator curve with an area under the curve of 0.97 (95% confidence interval, 0.895 to 1.032 P < 0.01), with a relative risk of IA 6.92 times higher than the control population and with predictive success of 95.2%. As regards early diagnosis, the serial detection of Aspergillus DNA took on average 21 days less than HRCT and 68 days less than GM. The serial detection of Aspergillus DNA using real-time quantitative PCR has great diagnostic applicability, which increases when combined with GM quantification.",2009,19109479,no
[Case of orbital apex syndrome caused by invasive aspergillosis successfully treated during the diagnostic procedure by the use of voriconazole].,"A 75-year-old woman developed loss of vision and decreased ocular motility in all directions. She exhibited a left orbital apex syndrome, accompanied by sphenoiditis and hypertrophic pachymeningitis. Voriconazole treatment was initiated on the basis of clinical suspicion, although use of the serum beta-D glucan had negative results and a biopsy was not performed. Five days later, the left eye movements started to improve, and at that time the use of the serum aspergillus galactomannan antigen proved to have positive results. Six months later, the patient was neurologically intact and stable, except for a lack of visual acuity in counting fingers. Earlier prognoses of invasive sino-orbital aspergillosis were dismal, especially when corticosteroid therapy was done before diagnosis. This case suggests the usefulness of antifungal agents during the diagnostic procedure even when localized invasive aspergillosis is not ruled out.",2009,19086432,no
Fungal pan-sinusitis with severe visual loss in uncontrolled diabetes.,"Invasive fungal pan-sinusitis can present atypically with severe acute visual loss with minimal anterior orbital inflammation. We describe 2 such cases with a background of uncontrolled diabetes.Respective clinical presentations of orbital apex and cavernous sinus syndromes were associated with isolation of Aspergillus galactomannan and Rhizopus.Urgent extensive surgical debridement and systemic antifungal is necessary.Clinical improvement of the ocular motor nerves can be expected within 2 months of treatment but visual loss is usually permanent.Underlying pansinusitis is an important differential for acute visual loss, especially in uncontrolled diabetics.

[The value of real-time PCR analysis of serum samples for early diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in organ transplant recipients].,"To study the value of Aspergillus real-time PCR as a tool for diagnosing invasive pulmonary aspergillosis(IPA) from serum samples in organ transplant recipients.From Jan.2004 to Mar.2006, 59 organ transplant recipients from Shanghai First People's Hospital with high possibility of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis were evaluated. Of the 59 patients, 5 had proven, 6 had probable, and 18 had possible invasive Aspergillus infection according to European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycosis Study Group definitions. A total of 274 serum samples were analyzed using real-time PCR.Seven of these immunocompromised patients were PCR positive, correlating with positive sputum cultures, positive histology, and positive signs of CT scans. False negative results were found in 2 patients. They had positive PCR results without any correlation to clinical or other diagnostic criteria. Twenty-eight immunocompromised patients with a negative PCR result showed no evidence of invasive fungal disease. Compared with sputum culture, CT scan and galactomannan test, PCR positivity preceded diagnosis by a mean of 7.9 d, 6.0 d, 1.5 d, respectively.Aspergillus real-time PCR is a helpful test for the early diagnosis of IPA in high-risk organ transplant recipients.",2010,19080569,no
Isolation of Aspergillus lentulus in Spain from a critically ill patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"Aspergillus lentulus was first described in the year 2005, and since it cannot be phenotypically distinguished from Aspergillus fumigatus, it is conceivable that earlier descriptions (before 2005) could be attributed to this new species. Currently invasive infections caused by A. lentulus are rare and very few cases have been previously published in neutropenic patients, all of them with fatal outcome. Here we report a critically ill non neutropenic patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted to the medical intensive care unit with an exacerbation of COPD and who had been treated with long term corticosteroids. A. fumigatus was cultured from two bronchial aspirates and in a third bronchial aspirate both A. lentulus and A. fumigatus were isolated. On two consecutive days detection of galactomannan in serum was negative whilst detection of (1-3) beta-D glucan was positive (> 518 pg/ml). Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for itraconazole, voriconazole, caspofungin and amphotericin B were high for this strain of A. lentulus. Given the high MIC values of A. lentulus to available antifungals, the accurate identification of this new species is warranted. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the isolation of A. lentulus in a non-neutropenic critically ill patient, although we note that since it was isolated only once from respiratory specimens, its implication as an etiologic agent of infection for this patient remains to be established.",2009,19071895,no
[Serologic diagnosis of fungal infections].,"Serologic markers such as fungal antigens and beta-D-glucan are becoming increasingly important for early diagnosis of invasive fungal infections (IFI). Fungal antigens detected with commercially available kits include mannan from Candida spp., galactomannan from Aspergillus spp., and galactoxylomannan from Cryptococcus spp. Measurement of (1,3)-beta-D-glucan in blood may be useful as a preliminary screening tool for IFI, despite the fact that beta-D-glucan can be detected in a number of other fungi. The clinical sensitivity and specificity of serologic assays for diagnosing IFI are somewhat variable. These variations are mainly related to the patient population examined, the test conditions and the frequency of the serologic survey. A large number of cases should be evaluated to clarify the characteristics of the assay kits.",2009,19069098,no
[Clinically documented fungal infections].,"Proven fungal infections are diagnosed by histological/microbiological evidence of fungi at the site of infection and positive blood culture (fungemia). However, invasive diagnosing examinations are not always applied for all of immunocompromised patients. Clinically documented invasive fungal infections are diagnosed by typical radiological findings such as halo sign on chest CT plus positive serological/molecular evidence of fungi. Serological tests of Aspergillus galactomannan antigen and beta-glucan for aspergillosis and cryptococcal glucuronoxylomannan antigen for cryptococcosis are useful. Hence, none of reliable serological tests for zygomycosis are available so far. In this article, risk factors, sign and symptoms, and diagnostic methods for clinically documented cases of invasive aspergillosis, pulmonary cryptococcosis, and zygomycosis with diabates, are reviewed.",2009,19069096,no
[Clinical features of chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis treated with voriconazole in patients with chronic respiratory disease].,"We analyzed clinical features of chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis (CNPA) in patients with underlying chronic respiratory disease, and evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of voriconazole against CNPA in those patients. Voriconazole therapy was indicated in 45 CNPA patients between October 2005 and September 2007, in 23 patients as first-line treatment and in 22 after lack of response to or intolerance of prior antifungal agent. The most common underlying respiratory disease was sequelae of tuberculosis (n = 23) followed by COPD (n = 13). Cavitary lesions were found in 32 patients. Galactomannan antigen test was positive in 29 patients while 28 patients out of 36 were positive for anti-Aspergillus serum antibody. The antibody-negative group had significantly higher levels of galactomannan antigen than the antibody-positive group. Mycological culture or hyphae were positive in 15 patients. Beta-D glucan level was within the normal limit in 27 patients. Clinical, radiological improvement, or both was obtained in 30 patients after an average voriconazole treatment of 4.8 months, with the main adverse effects being visual disturbance and hepatotoxicity. During the observation period 14 patients died due to CNPA or other causes. Although voriconazole demonstrated good efficacy against CNPA, the outcome is still unsatisfactory.",2009,19068757,no
Update on the epidemiology and diagnosis of invasive fungal infection.,"In recent years, the most important advances in the treatment of transplant recipients, patients with haematological neoplasm and critically ill patients have been accompanied by an increase in the incidence of common fungal diseases and the emergence of some less common ones. Although new techniques (e.g. galactomannan detection) and new antifungals have appeared, these opportunistic infections remain difficult to diagnose and have a high mortality. New diagnostic techniques could improve this outlook, although they are far from becoming available in daily practice.",2008,19013339,no
Fungal ascending aortic aneurysm after cardiac surgery.,"A 52-year-old diabetic male was admitted due to 1-month history of fever, fatigue, and mild shortness of breath. Three months prior to admission, he had undergone aortic valve replacement, with a prosthetic one, because of streptococcus viridans endocarditis complicated by severe aortic regurgitation. Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed prosthetic valve endocarditis with dehiscence of the aortic valve and an abscess cavity extending from the aortic root into the ascending aorta. Blood cultures and serology were negative. Due to clinical deterioration, despite antibiotic therapy, the patient was reoperated on and the aortic valve and ascending aorta were replaced with a homograft. Valve culture grew Aspergillus flavus. This case is an example of a rare but of increasing frequency complication after cardiac surgery. Considering the high mortality from this complication, early recognition is of paramount importance.",2008,19054035,no
Diagnosis and therapy of fungal infection in patients with leukemia--new drugs and immunotherapy.,"Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a common problem in immunocompromised patients. Patients with leukemia, especially those undergoing stem cell transplantation, are at increased risk for IFIs, particularly invasive aspergillosis (IA). Serial monitoring with the recently approved Aspergillus galactomannan antigen test has helped to improve the diagnosis and the monitoring of treatment of IA in cancer patients. There are several new options to treat cancer patients with fungal infections. These include new antifungal agents, such as the mould-active triazoles (itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole), the echinocandins (anidulafungin, caspofungin and micafungin), and the lipid formulations of amphotericin B. Immunotherapy with hematopoietic growth factors and interferon-gamma has been effective in some patients. Finally, donor-stimulated granulocyte transfusions may be useful in this patient population, but further research is required.",2008,19041608,no
Auto- and cross-reactivity to thioredoxin allergens in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"Thioredoxins are cross-reactive allergens involved in the pathogenesis of atopic eczema and asthma. Cross-reactivity to human thioredoxin can contribute to the exacerbation of severe atopic diseases.Human thioredoxin, Asp f28 and Asp f29, two thioredoxins of Aspergillus fumigatus, and thioredoxin of Malassezia sympodialis were cloned and produced as recombinant proteins. Allergenicity and cross-reactivity to thioredoxins in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis patients were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), inhibition ELISA, immunoblot analysis, proliferation assays and skin tests. Molecular homology modelling was used to identify conserved, surface-exposed amino acids potentially involved in immunoglobulin E (IgE)-binding.All thioredoxins, including the human enzyme, bind IgE from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and induce allergen-specific proliferation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and positive skin reactions in thioredoxin-sensitized patients. Inhibition experiments showed that the thioredoxins are cross-reactive indicating humoral immune responses based on molecular mimicry. To identify structural surface elements involved in cross-reactivity, the three-dimensional structures were modelled based on solved thioredoxin structures. Analysis of the molecular surfaces combined with sequence alignments allowed identification of conserved solvent exposed amino acids distantly located in the linear sequences which cluster to patches of continuous surface areas. The size of the surface areas conserved between human and fungal thioredoxins correlates well with the inhibitory potential of the molecules in inhibition ELISA indicating that the shared amino acids are involved in IgE-binding.Conserved, solvent exposed residues shared between different thioredoxins cluster to continuous surface regions potentially forming cross-reactive conformational B-cell epitopes responsible for IgE-mediated cross-reactivity and autoreactivity.",2008,19032234,no
[A day in Spanish microbiology. Descriptive study of the activity of the clinical microbiology departments].,"The laboratory is an essential part of the work in the Clinical Microbiology Department. This study has aimed to measure the activity of these laboratories.A survey was self-administered on the activity occurring during one work day by each hospital in October 2007.Thirty six hospitals reported 14,076 tests. Serology was the most frequently reported test (30.3%) followed by urine culture (27.8 %), blood tests (13.2 %), respiratory tract samples (8%), feces (7.1%), urethral (5.8%), skin (5.3%) and cerebrospinal fluid (2.6%). According to species, 73.2% of the isolates were bacteria (22.9 % were positive), 8.9% were virus (17% positive), fungi 8.1% (25.2% positive), and 5.5% mycobacterias (5.9% were positive) and parasite 4.5% (12.5% positive). Susceptibility test were performed by automatic methods (62.3%) followed by diffusion test (27.1%) and E-test (9.1%). A total of 5.6% of the susceptibility tests showed in vitro resistance to antibiotics. Fungi were identified in 108 isolates. Candida and Aspergillus were the most frequent genus (85.1% and 8.3%, respectively). Origins of the samples were: lower respiratory tract (32.4 %), genital tract (24.1 %), urine (10.2 %), blood (10.2 %) and skin (10.2 %). Twelve identification techniques were used, the most frequent being the morphological test (54.8%) and biochemical test (39.7%). Broken down by departments, 20.4% were sent from the ICU, 16.7% from surgery, 29.6% from medicine and 18.5% from primary care.Although the workload of the laboratories has been measured in this work, aspects such as specimen manipulation, clinical advice and research were not considered.",2008,19031120,no
Detection of Aspergillus spp. and aflatoxin B1 in rice in India.,"Twelve hundred rice samples consisting of paddy (675) and milled rice (525) were collected from 20 states across India. These samples were assessed for Aspergillus spp. infection on selective medium and aflatoxin B(1) (AFB1) by indirect competitive ELISA. In this investigation, Aspergillus flavus contamination dominated in all the seed samples. The other major contaminants were Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus ochraceus and Aspergillus parasiticus. Out of 1200 rice samples, 67.8% showed AFB1 ranging from 0.1 to 308.0 microg/kg. All the paddy samples from Chattishgarh, Meghalaya and Tamil Nadu showed AFB1 contamination. Milled rice grains from different states showed below the permissible levels of AFB1 (average 0.5-3.5 microg/kg). Eighty-two percent of samples from open storage that were exposed to rain showed AFB1 contamination followed by one-year-old seed. Out of 1200 samples, 2% showed AFB1 contamination above the permissible limits (>30 microg/kg). This is the first comprehensive report of aflatoxin contamination in rice across 20 states in India.",2008,19028301,no
In vitro allergy tests compared to intradermal testing in horses with recurrent airway obstruction.,"Recurrent airway obstruction (RAO) is a common condition in stabled horses characterised by small airway inflammation, airway neutrophilia and obstruction following exposure of susceptible horses to mouldy hay and straw and is thus regarded as a hypersensitivity reaction to mould spores. However, the role of IgE-mediated reactions in RAO remains unclear. The aim of the study was to investigate with a serological IgE ELISA test (Allercept), an in vitro sulfidoleukotriene (sLT) release assay (CAST) and with intradermal testing (IDT) whether serum IgE and IgE-mediated reactions against various mould, mite and pollen extracts are associated with RAO. IDT reactions were evaluated at different times in order to detect IgE-mediated immediate type reactions (type I hypersensitivity reactions, 0.5-1 h), immune complex-mediated late type reactions (type III reactions, 4-10 h) and cell-mediated delayed type reactions (type IV hypersensitivity reactions 24-48 h). In the serological test, overall the control horses displayed more positive reactions than the RAO-affected horses but the difference was not significant. Comparison of the measured IgE levels showed that the RAO-affected horses had slightly higher IgE levels against Aspergillus fumigatus than controls (35 and 16 AU, respectively, p<0.05), but all values were below the cut off (150 AU) of the test. In the sLT release assay, seven positive reactions were observed in the RAO-affected horses and four in the controls but this difference was not significant. A significantly higher proportion of late type IDT reactions was observed in RAO-affected horses compared to controls (25 of 238 possible reactions versus 12 of 238 possible reactions, respectively, p<0.05). Interestingly, four RAO-affected but none of the control horses reacted with the recombinant mould allergen A. fumigatus 8 (rAsp f 8, p<0.05), but only late phase and delayed type reactions were observed. In all three tests the majority of the positive reactions was observed with the mite extracts (64%, 74% and 88% of all positive reactions, respectively) but none of the tests showed a significant difference between RAO-affected and control animals. Our findings do not support that IgE-mediated reactions are important in the pathogenesis of RAO. Further studies are needed to investigate whether sensitisation to mite allergens is of clinical relevance in the horse and to understand the role of immune reactions against rAsp f 8.",2008,19027178,no

"Utility of galactomannan enzyme immunoassay and (1,3) beta-D-glucan in diagnosis of invasive fungal infections: low sensitivity for Aspergillus fumigatus infection in hematologic malignancy patients.","Previous studies have reported that galactomannan (GM) enzyme immunoassay and 1,3 beta-glucan (BG) assay may be useful diagnostic tools, but their sensitivities are variable. We compared the performances of both tests. Between October 2002 and May 2005, 82 patients were prospectively monitored for 12 weeks. A total of 414 samples were tested by GM assay and 409 samples were tested by BG assay for the following four groups of patients: those with invasive aspergillosis (IA), those with other mold infections (Fusarium, scedosporium, zygomycosis, etc.), those with candidemia, and control patients. Blood samples were obtained twice on week 1 and once every other week for a total of 12 weeks. Patients in the invasive fungal infection groups had comparable risk factors. The sensitivity of the GM test was significantly higher for patients with IA due to non-fumigatus Aspergillus species than for patients with IA due to Aspergillus fumigatus (49% versus 13% P < 0.0001) or with other mold infections (49% versus 6%",2008,19005145,no
Outcome and medical costs of patients with invasive aspergillosis and acute myelogenous leukemia-myelodysplastic syndrome treated with intensive chemotherapy: an observational study.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a leading cause of mortality in patients with acute leukemia. Management of IA is expensive, which makes prevention desirable. Because hospital resources are limited, prevention costs have to be compared with treatment costs and outcome.In 269 patients treated for acute myelogenous leukemia-myelodysplastic syndrome (AML-MDS) during 2002-2007, evidence of IA was collected using high-resolution computed tomography and galactomannan measurement in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens. IA was classified on the basis of updated European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group definitions. Outcome of infection was registered. Diagnostic and therapeutic IA-related costs, corrected for neutropenia duration, were comprehensively analyzed from a hospital perspective. Voriconazole treatment was given orally from day 1 if possible.A total of 80 patients developed IA 48 (18%) had probable or proven infection, and 32 (12%) had possible IA. Seventy-three patients were treated with voriconazoleEarly diagnosis and treatment of IA with oral voriconazole result in acceptable mortality rates. Nevertheless, IA continues to have substantial attributable mortality combined with a major impact on hospital resource use, so effective prevention in high-incidence populations has the potential to save lives and costs.",2008,18990068,no
"Antibodies against glucan, chitin, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan as new biomarkers of Candida albicans infection that complement tests based on C. albicans mannan.","Antibodies against Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan (ASCA) and antibodies against synthetic disaccharide fragments of glucans (ALCA) and chitin (ACCA) are biomarkers of Crohn's disease (CD). We previously showed that Candida albicans infection generates ASCA. Here, we explored ALCA and ACCA as possible biomarkers of invasive C. albicans infection (ICI). ASCA, ALCA, ACCA, and Candida mannan antigen and antibody detection tests were performed on 69 sera obtained sequentially from 18 patients with ICIs proven by blood culture, 59 sera from CD patients, 47 sera from hospitalized subjects colonized by Candida species (CZ), and 131 sera from healthy controls (HC). ASCA, ALCA, and ACCA levels in CD and ICI patients were significantly different from those in CZ and HC subjects (P<0.0001). In ICI patients, these levels increased as infection developed. Using ASCA, ALCA, ACCA, and Platelia Candida tests, 100% of ICIs were detected, with the kinetics of the antibody response depending on the patient during the time course of infection. A large number of sera presented with more than three positive tests. This is the first evidence that the detection of antibodies against chitin and glucans has diagnostic value in fungal infections and that these tests can complement more specific tests. Future trials are necessary to assess the value of these tests in multiparametric analysis, as well as their pathophysiological relevance.",2008,18971303,no
Serologic diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in patients with cystic fibrosis through the detection of immunoglobulin G to Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is seen in approximately 10% of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and can be difficult to diagnose. Consensus criteria require the presence of multiple elevated immunologic markers such as total immunoglobulin E (IgE), Aspergillus IgE and Aspergillus IgG, or precipitins for a robust diagnosis. There is some degree of standardization of total IgE and Aspergillus IgE levels, but there is no standardization in the measurement of IgG antibodies or precipitins to Aspergillus. The interpretation of results may, therefore, be confusing. Eighty-seven patients with CF were categorized as having ABPA or as controls, using the consensus criteria and an in-house enzyme immunoassay to measure IgG levels to Aspergillus. All sera from patients were then analyzed by commercial fluorescent immunoassay (FEIA) for the quantitative detection of anti-Aspergillus IgG. FEIA results were analyzed against the consensus conference minimum diagnostic criteria to ascertain a cutoff point, which could predict a diagnosis of ABPA in CF. Eighty patients with CF and with no or incomplete evidence of ABPA had a mean FEIA score of 51.1 mg/L, whereas 7 CF patients with ABPA had a mean FEIA score of 132.5 mg/L. Using receiver operator characteristic curve analysis of the ImmunoCAP (Phadia) IgG score on ABPA versus all other patients gave an area under the curve of 0.933 (estimated SE, 0.027). This analysis provisionally suggested that a score of 90 mg/L may be used as a cutoff point, which would give a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 88.0% for the diagnosis of ABPA, though this requires further validation. This quantitative approach to Aspergillus IgG measurement in patients with CF along with the results of other tests will hopefully provide a more accurate approach to the diagnosis of ABPA.",2008,18947811,no

Invasive candidiasis in the ICU: prophylaxis versus preemptive treatment.,"Candidemia/invasive candidiasis has increased in incidence over the past 15 years. Because of numerous risk factors, intensive care unit patients have a predilection for this type of infection. Most of these infections are acquired endogenously, but occasionally may result from an exogenous source. Antifungal prophylaxis and preemptive antifungal therapy have been developed to prevent candidemia/invasive candidiasis. Antifungal prophylaxis with azoles has been demonstrated to reduce candidemia, overall mortality, and attributable mortality. This strategy is also effective for the prevention of invasive fungal infection in liver transplant recipients. Preemptive treatment appears to be a more focused intervention that uses markers (eg, the presence of colonization) and serologic testing to trigger the initiation of antifungal therapy. Further developments in serologic testing are necessary to enhance the precision of selecting the patients at risk for candidemia/invasive candidiasis. The optimum agent to be used prophylactically and for preemptive therapy requires further clinical investigation.",2008,18945385,no
Galactomannan detection as a tool for the diagnosis and management of cardiac aspergillosis in 2 immunocompetent patients.,"Serum galactomannan antigen detection was used for the diagnosis and follow-up of cardiac aspergillosis after surgery in 2 nonneutropenic patients.

Molecular detection of invasive aspergillosis in hematologic malignancies.,"Aspergillus species are the most frequent causes of invasive mold infections in immunocompromised patients, particularly those who underwent chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and efficiency of the PCR-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay method (PCR-ELISA) for early detection of Aspergillus species in patients with hematologic malignancies.From 2004 to 2006, 194 patients with hematologic malignancies (who received chemotherapy) were evaluated for invasive aspergillosis (IA) in Shiraz, southern Iran. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid anticoagulant whole blood samples were collected prospectively once a week and stored at -20 degrees C until examination. All collected blood samples were assayed for the presence of the bands on ethidium bromide stained gel and for hybridization.The female-to-male ratio was 61:133, the mean age of patients was 33.7 years, and mean of hospitalization period was 21.2 days. PCR-ELISA was positive in 14 (7.2%) patients who exhibited clinical and radiologic signs of IA. The etiologic agents were Aspergillus flavus (11 cases) and Aspergillus fumigatus (three cases). The mean time of positivity of PCR-ELISA in the blood before the appearance of clinical signs was 12.6 days. PCR was found to be the earliest indicator of IA preceding nonspecific clinical and radiologic findings. The sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values of PCR-ELISA to detect DNA-specific for Aspergillus species in patients with proven and probable IA were 66%, 96%, 62.5%, and 97%, respectively. In case patients were treated with antifungal drugs, and the treatment was successful, fungal PCR assay became negative after 14 days and if the treatment failed, assay was positive until death.We demonstrated, in the present study, the incidence of IA in leukemic patients and the usefulness of molecular assay for early diagnosis and monitoring of the treatment of IA.",2008,18854937,no
[Evaluation of the galactomannan assay for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in patients].,"To assess the value of Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) double-direct sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA).Forty nine patients were divided into IA group (n = 11), other invasive fungal infection group (n = 20) and Aspergillus colonization group (n = 18). The serum samples of all patients and 6 patients with IA after 7 day treatment were used for GM detection. A double-direct sandwich ELISA was employed to detect GM optical density index (ODI) in the serum samples. Measurement data followed the Gaussian distribution were expressed as x +/- s. Differences among groups were tested using a one factor analysis of variance. The significance of variation before and after therapy was tested with paired t test. P < 0.05 were considered to represent a significant difference. Statistical analyses were performed by SPSS statistical package.The serum GM ODI in IA patients was higher (1.63 +/- 0.29) than that in other IFI patients (0.96 +/- 0.49) and Aspergillus colonization patients (0.83 +/- 0.43) , F = 12.681, P < 0.05. The serum GM ODI of 6 patients with IA before and after treatment were 1.67 +/- 0.24 and 1.62 +/- 0.28 (t = 0.475, P > 0.05), respectively. If the cutoff GM ODI was 1.5, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for diagnosis of IA in the patients were 72.7% , 84.2%, 57.1% and 94.1%, respectively.The serum GM detection has diagnostic value for IA and could distinguish Aspergillus infection from other invasive fungal infections and Aspergillus colonization. A cutoff GM ODI of 1.5 showed the best sensitivity and specificity for IA in the patients.",2008,18846967,no
Performance characteristics of the platelia Aspergillus enzyme immunoassay for detection of Aspergillus galactomannan antigen in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.,"We have evaluated the Platelia Aspergillus enzyme immunoassay for detection of galactomannan in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens in solid organ transplant patients with aspergillosis. The precision and reproducibility in serum or BAL to which galactomannan was added were similar. Sensitivity was 81.8% in patients with aspergillosis, and specificity was 95.8% in lung transplant patients who underwent BAL for surveillance for infection or rejection. Among transplant controls, positive results were more common in patients (i) who underwent diagnostic BAL performed for evaluation of symptoms or chest computed tomographic abnormalities, (ii) who had undergone lung transplantation, or (iii) who were colonized with Aspergillus. Galactomannan testing in BAL is useful for diagnosis of aspergillosis in transplant patients. The significance of positive results in patients without confirmed aspergillosis requires further evaluation.",2008,18845830,no
Detection of circulating Aspergillus fumigatus DNA by real-time PCR assay of large serum volumes improves early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in high-risk adult patients under hematologic surveillance.,"Detection of galactomannan antigen (GMA) in serum is the standard assay for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in high-risk patients with hematological disorders. Detection of Aspergillus DNA in serum has been proposed, but its sensitivity is lower than that of GMA when small serum volumes (SSV) are used. In this study, we investigated whether extraction of DNA from large serum volumes (LSV) improves diagnostic yield. In a 13-month prospective study, we compared the performances of twice-weekly screening of serum for GMA by an enzyme immunoassay and weekly screening for Aspergillus fumigatus DNA by a real-time PCR (RT-PCR) assay of 1.0 ml (LSV) or 100 mul (SSV) of serum. We included 124 patients (138 treatment episodes), with 17 episodes of EORTC (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer)/MSG (Mycoses Study Group)-documented IA. In all, 1,870 samples were screened for GMA. The sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) of GMA for IA were 88.2%, 95.8%, 75%, and 98.3%, respectively. We screened 938 samples for Aspergillus DNA by using LSV 404 of these samples were also tested with SSV. The Se, Sp, PPV, and NPV of RT-PCR were 100%, 96.7%, 81%, and 100%, respectively, with LSV and 76.5%, 96.7%, 81.3%, and 95.6%, respectively, with SSV. DNA detection gave a positive result when performed on LSV in two cases of IA where the GMA assay result remained negative. Furthermore, in four IA cases, DNA was detected earlier than GMA. The use of LSV for extraction improved the performance of the RT-PCR, which appears highly sensitive and specific for the early diagnosis of IA in high-risk patients with hematological disorders.",2008,18845828,yes
Galactomannan detection for invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromized patients.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is the most common life-threatening opportunistic invasive mycosis in immunocompromized patients. A test for IA needs to be not too invasive and not too big a burden for the already weakened patient. The serum galactomannan ELISA seems to have potential for both requirements.To obtain summary estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of galactomannan detection in serum for the diagnosis of IA.We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science with both Medical Headings and text words for both aspergillosis and the sandwich ELISA. We checked reference lists of included studies and review articles for additional studies.Cross-sectional studies, case-control designs and consecutive series of patients assessing the diagnostic accuracy of galactomannan detection for the diagnosis of IA in patients with neutropenia or patients whose neutrophils are functionally compromised were included. The reference standard was composed of the criteria given by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the Mycoses Study Group (MSG).Two review authors independently assessed quality and extracted dataThirty studies were included in the meta-analyses, with a median prevalence of IA (proven or probable) of 7.7%. Seven of these (901 patients) reported results for an Optical Density Index (ODI) of 0.5 as cut-off value. The overall sensitivity in these studies was 78% (61% to 89%) and overall specificity was 81% (72% to 88%). Twelve studies (1744 patients) reported the results for cut-off value of 1.0 ODI, overall sensitivity was 75% (59% to 86%) and mean specificity 91% (84% to 95%). Seventeen studies (2600 patients) reported the results for cut-off value 1.5 ODI, sensitivity was 64% (50% to 77%) and mean specificity 95% (91% to 97%).At a cut-off value 0.5 ODI in a population of 100 patients with a disease prevalence of 8% (overall median prevalence), 2 patients who have IA, will be missed (sensitivity 78%, 22% false negatives), and 17 patients will be treated or further referred unnecessarily (specificity of 81%, 19% false negatives). If we use the test at cut-off value 1.5 in the same population, that will mean that 3 IA patients will be missed (sensitivity 64%, 36% false negatives) and 5 patients will be treated or referred unnecessarily (specificity of 95%, 5% false negatives). These numbers should however be interpreted with caution, because the results were very heterogeneous.",2008,18843747,no
Febrile neutropenia.,"This review summarizes the current status and diagnostic-therapeutic challenges in febrile neutropenia. Patients with neutropenia-associated infections have a poor prognosis. A large meta-analysis of trials assessing prophylactic antibiotics has shown significant survival benefits clinical significance of resistance is unclear. Administering broad-spectrum antibiotics to established febrile neutropenic patients has become selective, vancomycin is withheld unless absolutely necessary, and low-risk patients are identified with biological markers. Such patients are now managed with oral antibiotics at home or even without antibiotics. Protracted prolonged neutropenia is the setting par excellence for invasive fungal infections. Conventional amphotericin B administered to such risk patients reduces the incidence of fungal infections. New antifungal drugs have heightened efficacy and lowered toxicity. Novel antifungal diagnostic tests include imaging, particularly the CT ""halo"" sign (aspergillosis), and serology (glucan, galactomannan), and provide earlier diagnosis and treatment and better outcomes. Negative tests may indicate withholding antifungal therapy. High intermittent dosing of liposomal amphotericin B seems as safe and as effective as standard dosing regimens, but at half the drug acquisition cost. The use of nonantibiotic agents has offered alternative management strategies. Recombinant interleukin-11 reduces bacteremia, through a cytoprotective mechanism on the gut. rhIL-11 releases C-reactive protein and causes shedding of soluble TNF receptor-1, modulating the immunological milieu and the systemic inflammatory response. Other candidate molecules include RANTES and long-pentraxin 3. Recombinant growth factors reduce febrile episodes, permitting completion of chemotherapy, increase overall survival, and minimize infection mortality.",2008,18837909,no
"Invasive aspergillosis: diagnosis, prophylaxis and treatment.","Invasive aspergillosis is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in hematopoietic stem cells transplant recipients. Owing to its intrinsic high mortality rate, early diagnosis and treatment are critical. This review will therefore address the most important recent advances in diagnosing, preventing and treating invasive aspergillosis in hematopoietic stem cells transplant.The present review will focus on therapeutic and prophylactic aspects, with particular regard to clinical use of drugs other than voriconazole (which has a well known and consolidated role for first-line therapy), combination therapy and prophylactic regimens, particularly with posaconazole. This review will also briefly deal with the clinical role of diagnostic tests such as the detection of galactomannan in body fluids other than blood, beta-D-glucan in serum and fungal DNA by PCR in body fluids.Galactomannan antigen detection is a rather reliable diagnostic test for invasive aspergillosis, particularly when a lower threshold of sensitivity is used. PCR is still to be validated. Liposomal amphotericin B at 3 mg/kg per day showed a similar efficacy in invasive aspergillosis as reported for voriconazole. Therapeutic drug monitoring of Aspergillus-active azoles should be implemented whenever possible in order to maximize the antifungal effect and minimize toxicity. Posaconazole showed to be active in prophylaxis, though its effectiveness in the global patient population is still controversial.",2008,18832929,no
Purification and partial characterization of the xanthine-uric acid transporter (UapA) of Aspergillus nidulans.,"UapA, the uric acid-xanthine permease from the filamentous ascomycete Aspergillus nidulans, is one of the most thoroughly characterized purine/H(+) transporters in eukaryotes. Detailed studies have addressed its regulation of expression, at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels, in response to physiological and developmental signals. An extensive kinetic profile towards a plethora of purines and mutational analyses have established models on how UapA recognizes the purine ring and revealed specific amino acid residues involved in proper folding, topogenesis, function and specificity. The present work describes for the first time the purification of the UapA transporter of A. nidulans through overexpression via the strong, ethanol-inducible, glucose-repressible, alcA promoter. Purification, almost to homogeneity, was achieved by Ni(2+) affinity chromatography using a functional His-tagged UapA protein version. It is subsequently shown, by Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, that the purified protein is structured with a high alpha-helical content, as expected from the in silico predictions. The result of this work opens the way for further, analytical and biochemical studies on UapA at the protein level.",2008,18824106,no
Potential use of a monoclonal antibody for the detection of Candida antigens in an experimental systemic candidiasis model.,"The Candida species are the most common fungal pathogens of systemic candidiasis. The diagnosis of invasive candidiasis remains a laboratory and clinical challenge. Thus, development of diagnostic assays to detect systemic candidiasis and to identify Candida virulence factors and associated pathogenesis through immunohistochemistry using specific monoclonals and polyclonals will be useful. Inbred Balb/c mice were immunized with C. albicans antigens, and blood was checked for the presence of reactive antibodies using ELISA. Fusion was performed using the harvested spleen cells and NS1 myeloma cells, and the clones were screened for the presence of antibody producing hybrid cells by dot-blot. Western blot analysis showed that the L2D10 monoclonal antibody was reactive against the antigens with molecular weight of 20 kDa. Experimental systemic candidiasis in mice was induced through intravenous injection of C. albicans and all the vital organs were collected for immunohistochemistry study. The monoclonal antibody reacted to surface epitopes on the yeast cells, germ tubes, and hyphae, and to immune complexes. It was used with the polyclonal antibody in a sandwich ELISA for the detection of circulating antigens in experimental candiadiasis in mice. Antibody levels were also determined using the ELISA method, and the antibody levels of C. albicans infected mice were increased compared with uninfected animals. The monoclonal antibody was used in immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence techniques for the detection of fungal infection in tissue sections and was found to be more sensitive than conventional periodic acid Schiff or silver staining techniques. This monoclonal antibody may serve as potential primary capture antibodies for the development of a rapid diagnostic test for human systemic fungal infection.",2008,18823263,no
"Isolation, identification and toxigenic potential of ochratoxin A-producing Aspergillus species from coffee beans grown in two regions of Thailand.","In 2006 and 2007, 32 Thai dried coffee bean samples (Coffea arabica) from two growing sites of Chiang Mai Province, and 32 Thai dried coffee bean samples (Coffea canephora var. robusta) from two growing sites of Chumphon Province, Thailand, were collected and assessed for the distribution of fungi with the potential to produce ochratoxin A (OTA). The overall percentage of fungal contamination in coffee was 98% and reduced to 60% after surface disinfection. There were remarkable ecological differences in the composition of ochratoxigenic species present in these two regions. Arabica coffee bean samples from the North had an average of 78% incidence of colonization with Aspergillus of section Circumdati with Aspergillus westerdijkiae and A. melleus as the predominant species. Aspergillus spp. of section Nigri were found in 75% of the samples whereas A. ochraceus was not detected. Robusta coffee beans from the South were 98-100% contaminated with predominantly A. carbonarius and A. niger. A. westerdijkiae was only found in one sample. The diversity of the fungal population was probably correlated with the geographical origin of the coffee, coffee cultivar, and processing method. Representative isolates of section Circumdati (52) and Nigri (82) were examined for their OTA production using HPLC with fluorescence detection. Aspergillus westerdijkiae (42 isolates out of 42), A. steynii (13/13), and A. carbonarius (35/35) in general produced large amounts of OTA, while one isolate of A. sclerotiorum produced intermediate amounts of OTA. 13% of the A. niger isolates produced OTA in intermediate amounts. OTA levels in coffee bean samples were analyzed using the Ridascreen OTA ELISA kits. Of the 64 coffee bean samples analyzed, 98% were contaminated with OTA in levels of <0.6-5.5 microg/kg (Arabica) and 1-27 microg/kg (Robusta).

Aspergillus fumigatus conidia upregulates NOD2 protein expression both in vitro and in vivo.,"To determine if NOD2 is involved in host recognition of Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) conidia.An Af conidia pulmonary infection murine model was established by intranasal inoculation of Af conidia suspensions. Protein levels of NOD2 in lung tissue were determined by immunohistochemistry. A549 and phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-activated THP-1 cell lines were treated with heat-killed Af conidia, then the presence of NOD2 protein in these cell lines was detected by Western blotting. The ability of muramyl dipeptide (MDP) to induce the secretion of TNF-alpha after incubation with heatkilled Af conidia was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.The expression of NOD2 protein in lung tissue increased after Af conidia infection. Heat-killed Af conidia significantly upregulated NOD2 protein expression in A549 cells and PMA-activated THP-1 cells. Additionally, Af conidia in conjuction with MDP, significantly increased the secretion of TNF-alpha in A549 cells and PMA-activated THP-1 cells.Af conidia upregulates NOD2 protein expression in vitro and in vivo. These findings indicate that NOD2 protein may respond to Af conidia.",2008,18817625,no

Increased risk for invasive aspergillosis in patients with lymphoproliferative diseases after autologous hematopoietic SCT.,"The risk of invasive aspergillosis (IA) is considered to be low among autologous HSCT recipients, but an increase in the incidence has been observed recently in this setting. The aim of the study was to assess the influence of immunosuppressive drugs (steroids, rituximab, fludarabine, thalidomide), used in treatment of lymphoid malignancies during 6 months of pretransplant period, on IA incidence after autologous HSCT. A total of 109 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin's disease (HD) and multiple myeloma (MM), conditioned with carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan or melphalan and transplanted with PBSC, were analyzed prospectively. Patients were monitored with twice-weekly galactomannan test. High-resolution computed tomograhy of the chest and bronchoscopy were performed in case of positive galactomanan test, persistent fever or pulmonary infiltrates. Documented IA was diagnosed in nine (8%) patients (three proven, six probable). The incidence of IA was comparable in NHL, HD and MM patients and not influenced by age, advanced disease or conditioning regimen. Factors significant for development of documented IA by univariate analysis were treatment with fludarabine (P=0.008) or rituximab (P=0.039). The only factor predicting documented IA by multivariate analysis was treatment with fludarabine (P=0.008).

Patients at high risk of invasive fungal infections: when and how to treat.,"When and how to treat invasive fungal infections (IFIs) is discussed in this review, with a focus on the two most prevalent non-endemic IFIs, namely invasive aspergillosis and invasive candidiasis. Early treatment initiation in patients with IFIs has a profound impact on mortality rates, but reliable diagnostic measures are lacking. This situation has led to the parallel use of different treatment strategies, e.g. prophylaxis, empirical and pre-emptive treatment, as well as targeted treatment in response to a definite diagnosis of IFI. Identifying high-risk patients is the first step in reducing IFI-related mortality. Patients at risk of invasive aspergillosis comprise (i) those with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) during remission induction chemotherapy (ii) patients undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)",2008,18778118,no
Comparison of the value of measurement of serum galactomannan and Aspergillus-specific antibodies in the diagnosis of canine sino-nasal aspergillosis.,"Serology is currently used for the diagnosis of canine sino-nasal aspergillosis (SNA). However, the accuracy of serological testing using commercially available, standardized purified antigen preparations of Aspergillus (CAPurAspAg) has only been poorly documented. The aim of the present study was to assess the diagnostic value of an agar-gel double immunodiffusion (AGDD) test and an anti-Aspergillus IgG ELISA, using CAPurAspAg and the commercially available Platelia test for the detection of serum galactomannan. Sera from 17 dogs with SNA, 18 dogs with a nasal tumour (NT), 11 dogs with lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis (LPR) and 33 control dogs were tested with the 3 methods. AGDD result was positive in 76.5% of dogs with SNA, whereas all sera from dogs with non-fungal nasal disease and control dogs were negative. A positive IgG ELISA result was obtained in 88% of dogs with SNA and in 18% of dogs with LPR. All patients with NT and control dogs had a negative IgG ELISA result. The Platelia test was positive in 24% of dogs with SNA, 11% of dogs with NT, 9% of dogs with LPR and 24% of control dogs. The results of this study suggest that (1) the detection of serum Aspergillus-specific antibodies with AGDD or ELISA, using CAPurAspAg, provides excellent specificity and good sensitivity, (2) the specificity is higher for AGDD (100%) than for ELISA (96.8%) while sensitivity is higher for ELISA (88.2%) than for AGDD (76.5%) and (3) serum galactomannan quantification with the Plateliat test is unreliable for the diagnosis of canine SNA.",2008,18768268,no
[Early computed tomography signs in diagnosis of some pulmonary mycoses in myelotoxic agranulocytosis].,"To characterize minimal CT signs of initial pulmonary lesion in candidomycosis and invasive aspergillesis of the lungs.A multislice computer tomograph Light Speed+ (GE) was used to examine 67 patients with hematological malignancy in the condition of myelotoxic agranulocytosis (MTA). A CT picture considered as early presentation of fungal lesion of the lungs was seen in 25 (37%) of 67 patients. This diagnosis was made basing on the symptom of bronchiolyte manifesting roentgenologically as a ""tree in the kidneys"".Eleven (16%) patients in the condition of MTA for 5-7 days had clinical pulmonary symptoms accompanied with fungal lesion of the upper respiratory tract and a positive reaction to mannan, a candida antigen, signs of diffuse bronchiolyte. In 14 (21%) patients bronchiolyte symptom was detected in some lobules or segments on MTA day 5-12 and was not associated with pulmonary symptoms and an elevated level of Aspergillus antigen - galactomannan in the blood. A ""halo"" symptom accompanied with a high concentration of Aspergillus antigen was found in 7 (10%) patients untreated with antifungal drugs at the site of local bronchiolitis.A principal differential-diagnostic sign of bronchiolytis in candidomycosis and aspergillesis of the lungs as shown by multislice computed tomography and high resolution computed tomography is the pattern of its distribution. In candidomycosis bronchiolytis is subtotal or total, with small amount of liquid (> 100 ml) in the pleural cavities (37% cases). Invasive aspergillesis of the lungs is characterized by lobular or segmental bronchiolitis.",2008,18763591,no
Diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis using bronchoalveolar lavage in haematology patients: influence of bronchoalveolar lavage human DNA content on real-time PCR performance.,"In order to improve invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) diagnosis, a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay detecting Aspergillus spp. was developed. Its detection limit reached 2-20 conidia. The retrospective evaluation on 64 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids from 57 patients at risk for IPA, including 20 probable and five proven IPA patients, revealed a 88% or 38% sensitivity in direct examination (DE)/culture-positive or culture-negative BAL, respectively, whereas galactomannan (GM) sensitivity reached 88% or 58%, respectively. Influence on the Aspergillus-PCR yield of BAL fluid volume, cellular count and DNA content (evaluated by human beta-globin quantification) was assessed. Significantly higher beta-globin levels were detected in Aspergillus PCR-positive (median 5,112 pg/microl) than negative (median 1,332 pg/microl) BAL fluids, suggesting that the beta-globin level could reflect BAL yields and DNA extraction. Using beta-globin for the interpretation of fungal PCR could improve the negative predictive value of this test.",2008,18763000,no
Human platelets attenuate Aspergillus species via granule-dependent mechanisms.,"Using laser scanning microscopy, we investigated whether platelets are capable of internalizing Aspergillus conidia and examined Aspergillus-platelet adherence. The influence of platelets on fungal growth was evaluated by assessing galactomannan (GM) release, hyphal elongation, and colony size. A secretion assay with [(3)H]-serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) was performed. Exposure to platelets resulted in significantly decreased GM release (p<.05), hyphal elongation (p<.001), colony size, pigmentation, and 5-HT release ( p<.05). A lack of antifungal effects was observed with the microfilament inhibitor cytochalasin D. Platelets attenuate the virulence of Aspergillus species in vitro on the basis of granule-dependent effects.",2008,18752432,no
Role of (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.,"Measurement of serum (1-->3)-beta-D-Glucan (BG) is an aid in the diagnosis of fungemia and deep-seated mycoses, including invasive aspergillosis (IA). BG is present in the cell wall of most pathogenic fungi (including Pneumocystis jiroveci) in significant amounts with some notable exceptions such as Cryptococcus neoformans and Zygomycetes. Commercially available assays can detect serum BG concentrations as low as 1 pg/mL. Published validation studies have included patients with IA and other invasive fungal diseases (IFD). BG detection appears to be more sensitive than galactomannan detection in patients with IA, but BG's intrinsic lack of mycological specificity requires the integration of clinical, radiological, and microbiological data for proper interpretation. BG assay test characteristics can be used, for example, to exclude IA in some clinical scenarios, to increase the certainty of IA in the presence of an isolated positive galactomannan result or when testing follows initiation of antifungal treatment. BG may be falsely elevated in the serum in the absence of IFD in patients undergoing hemodialysis with cellulose membranes, in patients treated with immunoglobulin, albumin, or other blood products filtered through cellulose filters containing BG, and in patients with serosal exposure to glucan-containing gauze or to certain intravenous antimicrobials. These potential sources of false positivity should be considered when interpreting BG results. BG may be useful as a sensitive screening tool for surveillance of IA and other IFD in populations at risk. Stratified IFD screening and diagnostic strategies using both galactomannan and BG should be explored. Factors affecting the production and clearance of BG during IA and other IFD need additional study to further refine its diagnostic utility.",2008,18720216,no
Galactomannan antigenemia in pediatric oncology patients with invasive aspergillosis.,"Diagnosing invasive aspergillosis is difficult but might be improved by detection of circulating galactomannan. Although galactomannan antigenemia has been well studied in the detection of invasive aspergillosis in adult patients, little is known about the expression of circulating galactomannan in immunocompromised children with invasive aspergillosis.We studied the expression of galactomannan antigen by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) in 990 serum samples from 56 pediatric oncology patients (ages 3 months to 18 years) of whom 17 had proven or probable invasive aspergillosis defined by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Mycoses Study Group criteria. Any sample with a galactomannan EIA Galactomannan index value of > or = 0.5 was considered positive.At least 1 serum sample was positive for 11 of 17 pediatric oncology patients (65.7% sensitivity, 95% confidence interval: 38.3-85.7) with invasive aspergillosis. Galactomannan EIA was positive in 99 of 304 samples from patients with proven or probable invasive aspergillosis, and 7 of 686 (1.0%) samples from 39 control subjects resulted in a positive galactomannan EIA result. At least 1 sample tested positive in 5 of the 39 controls (12.8%, 95% confidence interval: 4.3-27.4). No significant association between accuracy and patient age was observed. Among the 7 evaluable galactomannan-positive patients with IA, the galactomannan EIA produced a positive result before clinical or radiographic evidence of infection in 6 cases, with a lead-time to diagnosis ranging from 1 day to 34 days (median: 10 days). In the remaining case, a positive galactomannan was observed on the same day as diagnosis by non-EIA methods.The presence of circulating galactomannan is predictive of invasive aspergillosis in most pediatric oncology patients. Galactomannan antigenemia may precede clinical, microbiologic, or radiographic evidence of invasive aspergillosis.",2008,18703991,no
Engineering Fusarium head blight resistance in wheat by expression of a fusion protein containing a Fusarium-specific antibody and an antifungal peptide.,"Fusarium head blight (FHB) or scab of wheat is a devastating disease in warm and humid regions at wheat-flowering periods worldwide. Natural resistance against FHB pathogens is inadequate and the development of FHB-resistant wheat cultivars has been a challenge. Expression of pathogen-specific antibodies in plants has been proposed as a strategy for crop protection. In this study, an antibody fusion protein comprising a Fusarium-specific recombinant antibody derived from chicken and an antifungal peptide from Aspergillus giganteus was expressed in wheat as a method for protecting plants against FHB pathogens. Plants expressing the antibody fusion displayed a very significantly enhanced resistance in T2 and T3 generations upon single-floret inoculation with the macroconidia of Fusarium asiaticum, the predominant species causing FHB in China, indicating a type II resistance. Spraying inoculation further revealed an enhanced type I resistance in the transgenic wheat plants. Remarkably, more grains were produced in the transgenic plants than the nontransgenic controls. Our results demonstrated that the antibody fusion protein may be used as an effective tool for the protection of crops against FHB pathogens.",2008,18700828,no
"A single channel for nitrate uptake, nitrite export and nitrite uptake by Escherichia coli NarU and a role for NirC in nitrite export and uptake.","Two related polytopic membrane proteins of the major facilitator family, NarK and NarU, catalyse nitrate uptake, nitrite export and nitrite uptake across the Escherichia coli cytoplasmic membrane by an unknown mechanism. A 12-helix model of NarU was constructed based upon six alkaline phosphatase and beta-galactosidase fusions to NarK and the predicted hydropathy for the NarK family. Fifteen residues conserved in the NarK-NarU protein family were substituted by site-directed mutagenesis, including four residues that are essential for nitrate uptake by Aspergillus nidulans: arginines Arg(87) and Arg(303) in helices 2 and 8, and two glycines in a nitrate signature motif. Despite the wide range of substitutions studied, in no case did mutation result in loss of one biochemical function without simultaneous loss of all other functions. A NarU+ NirC+ strain grew more rapidly and accumulated nitrite more rapidly than the isogenic NarU+ NirC(-) strain. Only the NirC+ strain consumed nitrite rapidly during the later stages of growth. Under conditions in which the rate of nitrite reduction was limited by the rate of nitrite uptake, NirC+ strains reduced nitrite up to 10 times more rapidly than isogenic NarU+ strains, indicating that both nitrite efflux and nitrite uptake are largely dependent on NirC. Isotope tracer experiments with [15N]nitrate and [14N]nitrite revealed that [15N]nitrite accumulated in the extracellular medium even when there was a net rate of nitrite uptake and reduction. We propose that NarU functions as a single channel for nitrate uptake and nitrite expulsion, either as a nitrate-nitrite antiporter, or more likely as a nitrate/H+ or nitrite/H+ channel.",2008,18691156,no
A polyphasic approach to the identification of ochratoxin A-producing black Aspergillus isolates from vineyards in Sicily.,"Aspergillus strains belonging to section Nigri isolated during a two year survey in eight Sicilian vineyards located on the slopes of Mount Etna (Sicily, Italy) were analysed analyzed in order to characterize species responsible for ochratoxin A (OTA) contamination of grapes. The polyphasic approach permitted analysis of biodiversity of Aspergillus isolates in relation to their morphology, ochratoxigenicity and genetic variability. We assessed OTA production by A. carbonarius, A. niger, A. tubingensis and A. japonicus using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A. carbonarius isolates were the strongest OTA producers. A subset of 66 representative strains was selected for further DNA-based characterization. PCR assays using species-specific primers discriminated between A. niger, A. carbonarius and A. japonicus on the basis of the target sequences for each species. The PCR-based methods matched morphological characterization in identifying all the black aspergilli (BA) isolates tested, whereas RFLP analysis with RsaI of isolates positive to PCRs with A. niger specific primers identified three A. tubingensis isolates. The identification of thirteen isolates was further confirmed by ITS analysis. By this method, each of the isolates was identified and assigned to an Aspergillus species. The fAFLP analysis of 40 isolates highlighted the power of this technique to discriminate different species and single strains, to verify the presence of mixed populations in the same vineyard, through homogeneous species clusters. No correlation was observed between the clusters and OTA production level or origin.",2008,18687497,no
Galactofuranose containing molecules in Aspergillus fumigatus.,Galactofuranose is a major carbohydrate in Aspergillus fumigatus. It became famous in medical mycology as being part of the galactomannan which was shown 30 years ago to be the major antigen circulating in the body fluid of patients suffering from invasive aspergillosis. Four different molecules contain galactofuranose in A. fumigatus: (i) the galactomannan present in the alkali soluble and insoluble fraction of the cell wall (ii) N- and O glycan moieties of secreted glycoproteins (iii) a GPI- anchored lipophosphogalactomannan and (iv) several sphingolipids also anchored to the membrane by an inositol phosphoceramide.,2008,18686165,no
Study on invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised patients to present a suitable early diagnostic procedure.,"The incidence of invasive fungal infections has increased considerably in recent years. The aim of this study was to present a suitable early diagnostic procedure in immunocompromised patients, using a molecular assay.From September 2005 to January 2007, 310 immunosuppressed patients were followed for fungal infections for a 6-month period. EDTA-anticoagulant whole blood specimens were collected prospectively once per week and stored at -20 degrees C until use in molecular assays.Molecular assays were positive in 55 (17.7%) patients. The etiologic agents were Candida albicans (67.3%), Aspergillus flavus (20.0%), Aspergillus fumigatus (7.3%), Candida tropicalis (3.6%), and Candida krusei (1.8%). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of PCR-ELISA with proven and probable invasive fungal infections were 84.6%, 92.7%, 75.3%, and 95.8%, respectively. The results showed that the mean clinical manifestation time was 38.96 days and the mean time of positivity of the molecular test (time of infection) was 17.69 days. A linear model for predicted infection and clinical manifestation time was found to be as follows: Y=11.64+1.147X, r(2)=0.812, where Y is the time at presentation of clinical signs and X is the time of infection (positive PCR-ELISA result).It may be concluded that the molecular assay would help in the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections at the early stage of infection, before clinical manifestations.",2008,18672389,no
Norsolorinic acid inhibits proliferation of T24 human bladder cancer cells by arresting the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase and inducing a Fas/membrane-bound Fas ligand-mediated apoptotic pathway.,"1. Norsolorinic acid, isolated from Aspergillus nidulans, has been shown to have antiproliferative activity in T24 human bladder cancer cells by arresting the cell cycle at the G(0)/G(1) phase and inducing apoptosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the antiproliferative activity of norsolorinic acid in T24 human bladder cancer cells. 2. The effects of norsolorinic acid (1, 5, 10 and 20 micromol/L) on the proliferation of T24 cells and on the distribution of cells within different phases of the cell cycle were investigated indirectly using an XTT assay and a flow cytometer, respectively. Factors affecting the cell cycle and apoptosis, including p53, p21, Fas receptor, Fas ligand (FasL) and caspase 8 activity, were examined using ELISA. 3. The results showed that norsolorinic acid inhibited proliferation of T24 cells in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC(50) of 10.5 micromol/L. The effect involved the induction of cell cycle arrest at the G(0)/G(1) phase and apoptosis. 4. These results demonstrate that G(0)/G(1) phase arrest is due to increased expression of p21 in cells treated with norsolorinic acid (10 and 20 micromol/L) for 24 h. Moreover, enhanced Fas and membrane-bound Fas ligand (mFasL) may be responsible for the apoptotic effect of norsolorinic acid. Thus, the present study reports, for the first time, that induction of p21 and the Fas/mFas ligand apoptotic system may participate in the antiproliferative action of norsolorinic acid in T24 human bladder cancer cells.",2008,18671724,no
Interleukin-6 treatment enhances human monocyte permissiveness for Paracoccidioides brasiliensis growth by modulating cytokine production.,"The effect of interleukin (IL)-6 on cytokine production was evaluated in human monocyte cultures infected with the virulent strain of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (Pb18). Peripheral blood monocytes from healthy individuals were preincubated for 24 h with or without human recombinant IL-6, and then challenged with Pb18 for 4 h and 18 h. P. brasiliensis growth was assessed by viable fungi recovery from co-cultures after plating on BHI-agar. Moreover, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-6 and IL-10 production in supernatant cultures was determined by enzyme immunoassay (ELISA). Monocyte preincubation with IL-6, and challenged with Pb18 for 4 h, led to significantly higher fungi recovery compared to non-treated co-cultures. The pretreatment of monocytes with IL-6 induced an inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha and IL-10 production during 18 h fungal infection. Otherwise, an autocrine stimulatory effect on IL-6 production was detected at 4 h and 18 h as represented by an elevation in IL-6 levels. The reduction in TNF-alpha levels and stimulation of IL-6 production induced by previous IL-6 treatment might be responsible for a significant increase in fungal growth in human monocytes. The results suggest that IL-6, by exerting a modulatory effect on cytokines production, makes monocyte more permissive for fungal growth.",2008,18668419,no
Assessment of Aspergillus-specific T cells for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in a leukemic child with liver lesions mimicking hepatosplenic candidiasis.,"A child with acute myeloid leukemia presented with multiple liver lesions mimicking hepatosplenic candidiasis during the neutropenic phase following the induction chemotherapy. All the available diagnostic tools showed repeatedly negative results, including galactomannan. An enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay showed a high number of Aspergillus-specific T cells producing interleukin-10 [TH2(IL-10)] and a low number of Aspergillus-specific T cells producing gamma interferon [TH1(IFN-gamma)], revealing invasive aspergillosis (IA) before the confirmatory biopsy. A progressive skewing from the predominance of TH2(IL-10) to a predominance of TH1(IFN-gamma) was observed close to the complete resolution of the infection and foreshadowed the outcome. The ELISPOT assay holds promise for diagnosing pediatric IA.",2008,18667632,no
Conventional or molecular measurement of Aspergillus load.,"The quantification of organisms is a standard tool. Measurement of a hyphal organism, like Aspergillus, presents difficulties in that it is problematic to define what constitutes a cell. Growth occurs by hyphal tip extension, in which the hypha elongates and a septum is formed behind the tip to divide it in to a separate compartment. However, communication between compartments and streaming of nuclei makes defining a cell of a hyphal organism difficult and the best method for quantification of the hyphal organism remains controversial. Conventional CFU determination of fungal burden in tissue homogenates is readily done by most laboratories, but CFU recovered temporally tend to show minimal increase, and may indicate that mechanical homogenization does not cause significant fragmentation of the hyphae in the tissues. Does the lack of increase in CFU as infection worsens inadequately reflect fungal load in the tissue? Non-culture based assays including chitin determination, quantitative PCR and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) of cell wall constituents, galactomannan or beta-glucan overcome this difficulty in part. However, qPCR and EIA do not indicate viability, may result in false negatives. qPCR assay may represent a significant over-estimation, because it correlates with number of nuclei present it also requires specialized equipment and reagents. Temporal studies of infection have demonstrated that qPCR and to some extent EIA reflect an increase in fungal burden not shown by CFU. Although qPCR and CFU may not correlate in those types of studies, comparative studies have shown CFU and qPCR do correlate when determining antifungal drug efficacy, where each method can clearly demonstrate differences in fungal burden",2008,18654916,no
False positivity of the Aspergillus galactomannan Platelia ELISA because of piperacillin/tazobactam treatment: does it represent a clinical problem?,"False-positive results of the galactomannan (GM) ELISA caused by concurrent administration of piperacillin/tazobactam have been reported in patients with febrile neutropenia.This prospective study investigated different sampling times in 30 patients receiving piperacillin/tazobactam for febrile neutropenia.Prior to the first piperacillin/tazobactam infusion, a median GM index of 0.2 [interquartile range (IQR) 0.1-0.3] was noted in two patients (7%) the index was 0.5. Immediately after piperacillin/tazobactam infusion, the median index increased to 0.3 (IQR 0.2-0.4, P = 0.002) leading to 21% (7/30) false-positive results, if > or = 0.5 is assumed as the cut-off level. GM indices before the next piperacillin/tazobactam infusion were not increased (median 0.2, IQR 0.2-0.35, P > 0.05), but 10% (3/30) were still > or = 0.5. With a cut-off level of > 0.7, no false-positive results were noted at any sampling time point.We conclude that the clinical relevance of false-positive GM results during piperacillin/tazobactam treatment is small if samples are collected prior to infusion and if a cut-off level of > 0.7 is used.",2008,18647743,no
Invasive mycoses in children receiving hemopoietic SCT.,"Invasive mycoses represent a rare but severe complication following hemopoietic SCT (HSCT) in children. Their incidence is related to the type of donor, being higher after allogeneic transplant, especially from alternative donors. Moreover, the incidence of invasive mycoses varies in the different post transplant phases. Neutropenia, lymphopenia, GvHD, high-dose steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs represent well-known risk factors. The clinical features of invasive mycoses after HSCT in children are similar to those observed in adults, and the diagnostic tools, including Aspergillus galactomannan antigen detection, are feasible also in pediatrics. Mortality due to invasive mycoses after HSCT in children is high.",2008,18545231,no
Establishing in vitro-in vivo correlations for Aspergillus fumigatus: the challenge of azoles versus echinocandins.,"Two clinical isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus, designated AT and DK, were recently obtained from patients failing caspofungin and itraconazole therapy, respectively. The isolates were tested by microdilution for susceptibility to itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, ravuconazole, and caspofungin and by Etest for susceptibility to amphotericin B and caspofungin. Susceptibility testing documented that the DK isolate was azole resistant (itraconazole and posaconazole MICs, >4 microg/ml voriconazole MIC, 2 microg/ml",2008,18644959,no
Approaches to management of invasive fungal infections in patients with hematologic malignancies.,"Invasive fungal infections have become increasingly common in patients with hematologic malignancies, especially in those at high risk with prolonged neutropenia and graft versus host disease after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and are associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. New diagnostic techniques and therapeutic agents have emerged recently to assist in the management of these infections. The galactomannan assay in association with routine clinical and radiologic screening may assist in the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis such that therapy may be initiated early. Also, several new antifungal agents have become available, allowing the practitioner more options in the prevention and treatment of fungal infections. New antifungal agents such as the lipid amphotericin B products, voriconazole, and the echinocandins appear to be safer to use than conventional amphotericin B. Voriconazole also has shown superiority to conventional amphotericin B in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis, and its well absorbed oral formulation makes it an excellent treatment to complete therapy as an outpatient. All these therapeutic options allow physicians to tailor antifungal therapy to the individual patient based on response and toxicity to prevent or treat invasive fungal infections. There are several new antifungal agents in development, and future studies will evaluate combination therapies to determine safety and efficacy.",2008,18628154,no
Real-time PCR on the first galactomannan-positive serum sample for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis in liver transplant recipients.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a life-threatening complication of liver transplantation. Detection of circulating galactomannan (GM) in serum samples is a method to improve the microbiological diagnosis in patients at risk for IA. However, the assay is hampered by false-positive results. The search for circulating Aspergillus DNA in the first GM-positive sample could improve the specificity of the test. Among 484 liver transplant recipients followed in a single center over 4 years, 25 patients had at least 1 GM-positive serum sample. The threshold of GM positivity was a ratio >or=1. These 25 patients were classified by the clinicians as probable IA (n=11), possible IA (n=2), and no IA (n=12) using the EORTC/MSG criteria with blinding to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results. After 1 mL aliquots of the first GM-positive serum sample were thawed, 2 independent DNA extractions were performed using the MagNA Pure Compact apparatus. Real-time amplification targeted at Aspergillus fumigatus mitochondrial DNA was performed on 10 microL of the final eluate in duplicate in the 2 independent DNA extractions using a LightCycler instrument. A sample was considered positive when the crossing point was <or=43 cycles in at least 2 out of the 4 replicates. Among the 13 probable or possible IA, 8 patients were PCR positive. The other 12 patients who had no IA were all PCR negative. Our data suggest that a concomitant real-time PCR performed on the first GM-positive sample improves the specificity of the first GM-positive assay result.",2008,18627580,no
Comparison of glutathione S-transferase activity and concentration in aflatoxin-producing and their non-toxigenic counterpart isolates.,"In this study, two techniques were used to compare the specific activity and total concentration of mycelial glutathione S-transferase (GST) in fungal strains isolated from natural sources. The fungi identified as Aspergillus parasiticus and Aspergillus flavus have been divided into two groups based on their ability to produce aflatoxins. Altogether 26 fungi were isolated, among which 12 were capable of producing varying levels of aflatoxin and 14 were proved to be non-toxigenic. GST specific activity in mycelial preparation was measured spectrophotometrically using 2,1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as the substrate. The results showed that the mean GST activity in toxigenic isolates was 25.06 +/- 9.8 micromol/mg protein/min which was 2.8-fold greater than that measured in non-toxigenic isolates (8.84 +/- 5.5 micromol/mg protein/min). Moreover, the GST concentration was compared in toxigenic and non-toxigenic isolates using an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay based on antigen (fungal preparation) and antibody (antibody produced against fungal GST in rabbit). The results of ELISA showed that the mean GST level in toxigenic and non-toxigenic fungi was 1.17 +/- 0.55 and 0.40 +/- 0.24, respectively. These results further confirm that the aflatoxin production in the fungal strains is correlated with GST expression and using ELISA, it is possible to discriminate aflatoxin-producing fungi from their non-toxigenic counterparts.",2008,18622719,no
"Toxigenic fungi and mycotoxins in outdoor, recreational environments.","Some epidemiological studies of damp buildings have focused on health risks from indoor exposure to toxigenic fungi and mycotoxins. Most of these studies have not considered assessment of these hazards in outdoor environments. The purpose of this investigation was to assess for toxigenic fungal species in outdoor recreational environments through the microbial analysis of locations representing opportunities for human exposure. A screening assessment was also conducted using commercially available ELISA kits to assess for trichothecene mycotoxins in outdoor samples.Ten swab and tape-lift samples were obtained from a city park. Swabs were cultured and identified by a trained mycologist. Bulk samples of grasses were screened for deoxynivalenol using a commercial ELISA assay. A pilot study of 6 bulk samples was screened for macrocyclic trichothecenes using a commercial ELISA assay.Tape-lift samples contained trace to moderate spores. Penicillium and Aspergillus-like spores were identified in 50% of tape-lift samples. 50% of swab samples contained potentially toxigenic species of Penicillium (P. citrinum, P. brevicompactum, P. chrysogenum). None of the bulk samples tested positive for deoxynivalenol. 3 of 6 (50%) bulk samples were positive for macrocyclic trichothecenes (> 0.2 ppb), however both negative control samples also tested positive.Potentially toxigenic fungi were commonly encountered in an outdoor, recreational environment. Future epidemiological studies need to consider outdoor activities in hazard and exposure assessment. Further work is needed to define the accuracy of commercially developed ELISA kits that are being used for the detection of mycotoxins in environmental samples.",2008,18615277,no
Diagnosis of histoplasmosis in immunosuppressed patients.,"To define the most appropriate studies for making a diagnosis of histoplasmosis in immunosuppressed patients.As is true of all fungal infections in immunosuppressed patients, heightened awareness of the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of histoplasmosis is essential in making an early diagnosis. Increasingly, Histoplasma antigen detection is used to help establish a diagnosis of histoplasmosis. Most of the reported data are on patients with AIDS, but limited data suggest the usefulness of this assay in other immunosuppressed patients as well. False positive reactions occur with other fungal infections, especially blastomycosis, and patients who have histoplasmosis may have a false positive serum Aspergillus galactomannan assay. The identification of the yeast phase of Histoplasma capsulatum in tissue biopsy samples and, uncommonly, in circulating blood phagocytes is also helpful in establishing a diagnosis quickly. PCR techniques have yet to prove useful for the rapid diagnosis of histoplasmosis, and serology is often negative in immunosuppressed patients. Culture remains definitive and should always be performed to confirm the results of the rapid diagnostic studies.Rapid techniques, mostly antigen detection in serum and urine and histopathological identification of Histoplasma capsulatum in tissues, are the most important rapid diagnostic tests for histoplasmosis in immunosuppressed patients.",2008,18594296,no
Diagnostic and therapeutic approach to persistent or recurrent fevers of unknown origin in adult stem cell transplantation and haematological malignancy.,"Persistent or recurrent fevers of unknown origin (PFUO) in neutropenic patients on broad-spectrum antibiotics have traditionally been treated with empirical antifungal therapy (EAFT). The lack of survival benefit seen with the use of amphotericin B deoxycholate (AmB-D) as EAFT has been attributed to its toxicities. More recently, newer, less toxic and more expensive antifungal agents such as the lipid formulations of AmB, the newer azoles (fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole) and caspofungin have been analysed in a number of EAFT trials. Compared with AmB-D the newer agents have superior safety but are of equivalent efficacy. This lack of survival advantage is related to the fact that the trigger for commencement of EAFT is late and non-specific. Thus, alternative approaches are required. New sensitive serological and molecular tests for the detection of Aspergillus antigens and genomic DNA have been developed and evaluated in accuracy studies. These tests have been incorporated into management strategies (i.e. pre-emptive strategies) to direct antifungal therapy. The pre-emptive approach has been shown to be safe and feasible but its impact on clinically important patient outcomes such as survival is less clear. Other advances include the introduction of effective, non-toxic mould-active antifungal prophylaxis and patient risk-group stratification.

Molecular diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in patients with hematologic malignancies - new answers to a diagnostic challenge?,"Within recent years, new molecular methods have been developed to improve the diagnosis of life-threatening invasive aspergillosis in patients at high risk, especially patients with malignant hematological diseases undergoing intensive chemotherapy. Both early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for adequate therapeutic management, which, however, often remains difficult and unclear, because most of the conventional diagnostic tools used clinically at present lack either specificity or acceptable sensitivity at the critical, early phase of the infection.To review the clinical value, advantages and problems and drawbacks of molecular approaches, especially polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays, to detect genomic DNA of Aspergillus species, still the most emerging fungal pathogens, in blood, BAL and tissue samples.A review of the literature was carried out and expert opinions expressed.Summarizing the results of numerous attempts to diagnose invasive aspergillosis by PCR-based detection of fungal genome in clinical samples, at least four clinically well-evaluated assays highlight the potential of the PCR technique to improve early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in patients with hematological malignancies under intensive antineoplastic treatment, especially in combination with imaging surveillance and serologic diagnostic tools, other important parts of the diagnostic mosaic. Further clinical comparative validation of reliable assays in prospective multi-center studies is mandatory and needed urgently, leading finally to a standardization, so that one or more 'gold standard assays' may be incorporated into diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms, to improve the prognosis of patients with life-threatening infections caused by Aspergillus species.",2008,23495815,no
Aspergillus fumigatus antigens activate immortalized human corneal epithelial cells via toll-like receptors 2 and 4.,"To evaluate the role of toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and 4 in host responses to Aspergillus fumigatus by use of cultured telomerase-immortalized human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs).HCECs were stimulated with inactive antigens from A. fumigatus. The expression of TLR2 and TLR4, phosphorylation of Ikappa B-alpha (pIkappa B-alpha), and release of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6 was measured with and without inhibitors to TLR2 and TLR4.Exposure of HCECs to A. fumigatus antigens resulted in up-regulation of TLR2 and TLR4, activation of pIkappa B, and release of IL-1beta and IL-6 in HCECs, effects that could be inhibited by treatment with TLR2 and TLR4 antibodies.TLR2 and TLR4-nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathways in corneal epithelium play important roles in inflammatory responses against A. fumigatus antigens.",2008,18568882,no
Contribution of galactofuranose to the virulence of the opportunistic pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus.,"The filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus is responsible for a lethal disease called invasive aspergillosis that affects immunocompromised patients. This disease, like other human fungal diseases, is generally treated by compounds targeting the primary fungal cell membrane sterol. Recently, glucan synthesis inhibitors were added to the limited antifungal arsenal and encouraged the search for novel targets in cell wall biosynthesis. Although galactomannan is a major component of the A. fumigatus cell wall and extracellular matrix, the biosynthesis and role of galactomannan are currently unknown. By a targeted gene deletion approach, we demonstrate that UDP-galactopyranose mutase, a key enzyme of galactofuranose metabolism, controls the biosynthesis of galactomannan and galactofuranose containing glycoconjugates. The glfA deletion mutant generated in this study is devoid of galactofuranose and displays attenuated virulence in a low-dose mouse model of invasive aspergillosis that likely reflects the impaired growth of the mutant at mammalian body temperature. Furthermore, the absence of galactofuranose results in a thinner cell wall that correlates with an increased susceptibility to several antifungal agents. The UDP-galactopyranose mutase thus appears to be an appealing adjunct therapeutic target in combination with other drugs against A. fumigatus. Its absence from mammalian cells indeed offers a considerable advantage to achieve therapeutic selectivity.",2008,18552284,no
Bronchogenic carcinoma and secondary aspergillosis--common yet unexplored: evaluation of the role of bronchoalveolar lavage-polymerase chain reaction and some nonvalidated serologic methods to establish early diagnosis.,"More cases of bronchogenic carcinoma have been reported in recent years, and these patients are more prone to secondary aspergillosis. However, the frequency of secondary aspergillosis in bronchogenic carcinoma still has not been defined clearly in the literature.The current study population was comprised of 69 patients with bronchogenic carcinoma and 16 healthy controls. Histopathologic examination was done to identify carcinoma cell types and to categorize aspergillosis types. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids were collected for direct fungal examination, culture, Aspergillus polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and galactomannan (GM) detection using a 1-stage immunoenzymatic sandwich microplate assay and blood samples were collected for fungal serology by double immunodiffusion (DID), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and dot blot assay (DBA). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were analyzed for various nonvalidated tests. Twenty-five patients had follow-up data available for an analysis of clinical and diagnostic outcomes.The cohort included patients with squamous cell carcinoma (n = 47), adenocarcinoma (n = 16), small cell carcinoma (n = 3), large cell carcinoma (n = 2), and undiagnosed type (n = 1), and patients were categorized with definite invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) (n = 6), probable IPA (n = 17), possible IPA (n = 13), and non-IPA (n = 33). Most patients were in the group ages 45 years to <60 years, and there was a preponderance of men (10.5:1). Cultures from 20 of 69 patients (29%) revealed the growth of Aspergillus species. Anti-Aspergillus antibodies were detected in 26 of 69 patients (37.7%) each by DID and DBA, whereas antibodies were detected in 28 of 69 patients (40.6%) by ELISA. GM was detected in BAL fluids from 25 of 69 patients (36.2%), whereas Aspergillus DNA was detected in 32 of 69 patients (46.4%) by PCR. The sensitivity of PCR and serologic tests (ELISA, DID, and DBA) was 100% for definite IPA, whereas the sensitivity of PCR was comparatively higher than that of serologic tests for probable IPA, possible IPA, and non-IPA.The current study indicated that there frequently is an association between bronchogenic carcinoma and secondary aspergillosis, and definite IPA and probable IPA are common clinical problems in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer.",2008,18521930,no
MALDI-TOF MS analysis of labile Lolium perenne major allergens in mixes.,"It is well known that allergen extracts used for specific therapy of allergic disorders are commonly stored as mixtures, causing an alteration of its stability.The aim of this report is to identify pollen allergens susceptible to degradation during storage of mixtures containing different sources of proteases in the absence of glycerol as a preserving agent.Mixes containing Lolium perenne (Lol p) pollen extract with either Aspergillus fumigatus or Periplaneta americana extracts were prepared and co-incubated for 90 days at 4 degrees C. Samples were taken off at fixed times and comparatively tested by in vitro and in vivo assays with atopic patients. Selected pollinic allergens were subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analysis.ELISA inhibition evidenced the loss of potency from ryegrass extract, and immunoblotting assays showed the degradation of specific pollinic allergens during storage of mixtures containing protease-rich sources. An in vivo intradermal skin assay confirmed the gradual loss of the biological activity of L. perenne pollen extract co-incubated with non-related protease-rich extracts in comparison with that of the control pollen extract. MALDI-TOF MS analysis allowed us to determine that Lol p 1 and Lol p 5 are susceptible to proteolysis whereas Lol p 4 was found to be resistant to degradation during storage.Lol p 1 and Lol p 5 degradation is responsible for the loss of the biological activity of L. perenne pollen extract when co-incubated with protease-rich fungal and cockroach extracts in the same vial for months in the absence of glycerol as a preserving agent. The integrity of these major allergens must be preserved to increase the vaccine stability and to assure efficacy when mixes are used for immunotherapy.",2008,18503569,no
Construction of multiform scFv antibodies using linker peptide.,"Multiform single chain variable fragments (scFvs) including different length linker scFvs and bispecific scFv were constructed. The linker lengths of 0, 3, 5, 8, 12, and 15 amino acids between V(H) and V(L) of antideoxynivalenol (anti-DON) scFv were used to analyze the affinities of scFvs. The affinity constants of these scFvs increased when the linker was lower than 12 amino acids. The affinity constant would not change when the linker was longer than 12 amino acids. Fusion gene of anti-DON scFv and antizearalenone (anti-ZEN) scFv was also constructed through connection by a short peptide linker DNA to express a bispecific scFv. The affinity constants assay showed that the two scFvs of fusion bispecific scFv remained their own affinity compared to their parental scFvs. Competitive direct enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect DON and ZEN in contaminated wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) samples, and the results indicated that this bispecific scFv was applicable in DON and ZEN detection. This work confirmed that bispecific scFv could be successfully obtained, and might also have an application in diagnosing fungal infection, and breeding transgenic plants.",2008,18499076,no
IL1 gene cluster polymorphisms and its haplotypes may predict the risk to develop invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and modulate C-reactive protein level.,"The aim of this study was to determine whether interleukin-1 alpha (IL1alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL1beta), and IL1 receptor antagonist (IL1Ra) polymorphisms are implicated in invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) pathogenesis.Subjects comprised 110 hematological patients and 148 healthy controls. Genotypic and allelic frequencies were similar between hematological patients and controls. IPA was diagnosed in 59 of the 110 patients according to consensus criteria published by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group (EORTC/IFICG).Individual locus analysis showed that IL1alpha and IL1Ra polymorphisms were not associated with the presence of IPA (p = 0.560 and p = 0.680, respectively). However, a trend towards a higher presence of IL1beta( - ) (511TT) genotype (or IL1beta(-511T) allele) in the IPA group than in the non-IPA patient group (p = 0.092 and p = 0.095, respectively) was found. Haplotype analysis revealed that VNTR2/-889C/-511T haplotype was strongly associated with susceptibility to develop IPA infection (p = 0.020). Haplotype analysis also showed an association between VNTR2/-889C/-511C haplotype and resistance to IPA infection (p = 0.028). Furthermore, patients with IL1Ra VNTR2/2 and IL1beta(-511)T/T genotypes had a higher positive serum galactomannan percentage versus patients with other genotypes. Finally, C-reactive protein (CRP) production was significantly associated with IL1 gene cluster polymorphisms, although CRP values were similar between IPA and non-IPA groups.These findings indicate a critical role of IL1 gene cluster polymorphisms in the susceptibility to IPA infection and CRP production.",2008,18484169,no
[Value of CT in allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS)].,"To assess the value of CT for diagnosis and follow-up of AFS. Evaluation of characteristic CT features of AFS.Retrospective review of 12 cases of AFS presenting with all published diagnostic criteria (1) chronic rhinosinusitis refractory to standard management (2) CT features of chronic sinusitis (3) anatomopathologic, immunoallergologic, biochemical and mycologic criteria. CT findings were correlated with surgical findings and reviewed by one ENT and two radiologists to assess the diagnostic value of different CT features, alone or in association.AFS was isolated in 6 cases, and associated with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in 6 cases. CT showed pan- or polysinusitis, unilateral or bilateral, with mucosal thickening, sinus opacification frequently heterogeneous, bony changes, fluid trapping, and with pseudotumoral appearance in 3 cases.CT findings alone are not specific or pathognomonic but may suggest AFS in the correct clinical or immunoallergologic setting. It may alert the physician to the need for complementary work-up, exclude the presence of associated lung disease, and better adapt treatment and follow-up.",2008,18477954,no
"Assessment of Aspergillus fumigatus burden in pulmonary tissue of guinea pigs by quantitative PCR, galactomannan enzyme immunoassay, and quantitative culture.","Early diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is problematic in some patient groups due to the lack of rapid, sensitive, specific, and reliable diagnostic tests. Fungal burden and therapeutic efficacy were assessed by survival, quantitative culture (CFU counts), galactomannan enzyme immunoassay (GM-EIA), and quantitative PCR (qPCR) in a new guinea pig model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis using an aerosol challenge. At 1 day postinfection, qPCR determined that the pulmonary fungal burden was 2 log(10) higher than that determined by CFU counting and increased significantly (P < 0.03) over time. In contrast, the tissue burden assessed by CFU counting did not rise over the course of the study. Therapy with the antifungal drug voriconazole produced statistically significant decreases in pulmonary fungal burden, as detected by CFU counting (P < 0.02), qPCR, and GM-EIA (both P < 0.0002). Daily assessment of the progression of fungal infection in serum was performed by qPCR and GM-EIA. GM-EIA demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the fungal load on days 6 and 7 in voriconazole-treated animals compared to time-matched controls (P < 0.02). Confirmation of fungal tissue burden by two or more methods should provide a more precise account of the burden, allowing improved assessment of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.",2008,18474582,no
The application of monoclonal antibodies to the diagnosis of disseminated mycoses.,"Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) have had a major impact on many areas of biomedical research and almost since their advent have been used in the characterisation and identification of diagnostically important antigens of fungal pathogens. Their main significance lies in three, often inter-related areas: a) the definition and characterisation of antigens for use in detection of antibody responses, b) their direct use in the detection of diagnostically useful antigen in body fluids c) their application in immunohistochemical diagnosis. The degree to which MoAbs have been applied varies between fungal pathogens, and they have now been used, for example, in the serodiagnosis of Aspergillus spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Their use in producing diagnostic tests for other fungi such as Sporothrix schenckii and Penicillium marneffei has been more restricted but considerable potential exists for further development.",2008,18473530,no
[Preparation and study of an exoantigen of Histoplasma capsulatum for serological reactions.].,"The aim of this study was to determine the usefulness of a yeast-phase exo-antigen of Histoplasma capsulatum in standard serologic reactions. Three native strains of H.capsulatum which belong to Mycology Center collection were employed. They were maintained in their yeast-phase by weekly subcultures in 2% dextrose broth agar at 37 degrees C. After one week incubation yeast cells were suspended in distilled water containing thimerosal and phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride at a concentration of 1:5000. This suspension was left at room temperature for 72 h, then the supernatant was separated by centrifugation and it was lyophilized. Proteins and polysaccharides concentrations were determined. Immunodiffusion (ID) tests were carried out with an antigenic dilution containing 1.4 mg/ml of proteins. This exo-antigen was submitted to SDS-PAGE. Seven protein fractions were detected but only two of them showed antigenic activity against a pool of positive human sera the molecular weights of these two proteins were 97 kDa and 66 kDa respectively. A metabolic antigen from the mycelial phase of H. capsulatum was used as control. A rabbit gammaglobulin anti-H. capsulatum was prepared and employed as positive control in serologic reactions. The antigenic capacity of ten batches of this exo-antigen was studied by ID and counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE) tests using serum samples of 20 hamsters experimentally infected by intracardiac inoculation of the yeast-phase of H. capsulatum. All tests presented positive results after three weeks of the infection. Fifty sera from patients suffering progressive histopasmosis were analyzed: ID, CIE and complement fixation (CF) tests were performed in all cases. HIV negative patients presented 7/7 (100%) positive reactions with the yeast-phase exoantigen and 5/7 (71.4%) with histoplasmin. In HIV positive patients CIE and CF were the most sensitive serologic tests, they gave positive results in 15/43 cases (34.8%) with the yeast-phase exo-antigen and in 7/43 cases (13.9%) with histoplasmin. Sera from 10 patients with paracoccidioidomycosis, aspergillosis and candidiasis respectively were studied by ID with the aim of detecting serologic cross reactions. No cross reaction was detected in these serum samples. This yeast-phase exo-antigen of H. capsulatum is more sensitive than and equally as specific as control histoplasmin.",2008,18473518,no
"Association of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and asthma: clinical and radiological features, allergy and inflammation markers.","Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with and without nasal polyps represent different stages of one chronic inflammatory disease of the mucosa of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Coexistence of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and asthma and rather similar characteristics of inflammation support assumption that chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps and asthma may be, at least in part, the same disease process. We therefore aimed to evaluate the differences of sinus radiologic findings, systemic inflammation and allergy markers, pulmonary function of chronic rhinosinusitis associated with nasal polyps and asthma. A total of 121 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis referred to tertiary center were evaluated 23 healthy persons served as controls. Sinus CT scans and nasal endoscopy were performed. Allergic rhinitis was diagnosed according to history and positive skin prick tests to common inhalant allergens. Asthma was diagnosed according to GINA by history and pulmonary function tests. Aspirin intolerance was assessed by history. Total IgE, Aspergillus fumigatus-specific IgE levels, leukocyte and eosinophil count in the peripheral blood were measured. Nasal polyps were detected in 84 patients (69.4%), asthma diagnosed in 48 patients (39.6%), associated with nasal polyps (91.7%) and allergic rhinitis in 45.5% of patients. Forty-four patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and having nasal polyps and asthma were characterized by older age (P<0.01), greater duration of nasal symptoms (P<0.001), higher number previous surgeries (P<0.01), more severe sinus disease on CT scan (P<0.001), greater blood leukocyte and eosinophil count, total IgE level (P<0.01), bronchial obstruction (P<0.05), incidence of allergic rhinitis (P<0.01), and sensitivity to house dust mite D. pteronyssinus (47.7%, P<0.01) and mold allergens (29.5%, P<0.01) comparing to the patients with isolated chronic rhinosinusitis. The extent of sinus CT changes was greater in asthmatics and correlated with greater duration of asthma (P<0.0001), higher number of previous surgeries (P=0.001), leukocyte count in blood (P=0.025), and age (P=0.039). CONCLUSION. Our data indicate that patients with chronic rhinosinusitis compose clinically heterogeneous group and when associated with nasal polyps and asthma constitutes the most severe form of unified respiratory tract disease, which is characterized by older age of the patients, greater duration of nasal symptoms, extent of sinus radiological changes, more prominent systemic inflammation markers, greater bronchial obstruction, incidence of perennial allergic rhinitis.",2008,18469501,no
Correlation between high-resolution computed tomography and galactomannan antigenemia in adult hematologic patients at risk for invasive aspergillosis.,"To analyse the predominant radiological pattern of pulmonary lesions in adult hematologic patients at risk for invasive aspergillosis (IA) together with the results of serial serum Aspergillus galactomannan antigen testing (GM).In a prospective study for patients at high risk of aspergillus pulmonary infection, serum GM were performed 2-3 times per week during the periods of high risk for IA and high-resolution CT (HRCT) was performed in case of abnormal chest X-ray (CXR) and/or persistent fever after 5 days of antibiotic treatment. Changes on HRCT scan were classified as airway IA and angioinvasive IA. IA was classified as proven or probable in accordance with the definitions stated by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycosis Study Group (EORTC-MS). Positive GM testing was not considered as microbiological criterion.38 hematological patients were diagnosed of probable (n=28) or proven (n=10) IA. 55% patients had a neutrophil count less than 500 mm(-3) (n=21), and 37% patients > or =2 risk factors for IA. All probable IA were diagnosed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Proven IA was reached by positive histopathologic and culture results of samples obtained by autopsy (n=4), percutaneous (n=3) or transbronchial biopsy (n=3). 18 patients had airway IA, and 60% had a GM level > or =1.5. 20 patients were diagnosed of angioinvasive IA from which 80% had a GM level > or =1.5.Serum GM levels may be lower in patients with airway IA than in those with an angioinvasive form. HRCT and serum GM are complementary tests in the diagnosis of IA.",2008,18468830,no

Development of an immunochromatographic lateral-flow device for rapid serodiagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.,"Aspergillus fumigatus is a cosmopolitan saprotrophic fungus that is second only to Candida species as a cause of invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised humans. Current immunodiagnostic tests for invasive aspergillosis (IA) are based on the detection of circulating galactomannan (GM) in a patient's serum by using a rat monoclonal antibody (MAb), EB-A2, that binds to tetra (1-->5)-beta-D-galactofuranoside, the immunodominant epitope in GM. The potential cross-reactivity of MAb EB-A2 with non-Aspergillus fungi, with contaminating GM in beta-lactam antibiotics and foodstuffs, and with bacterial lipoteichoic acids has prompted efforts to discover non-GM antigens that can act as surrogate markers for the diagnosis of IA. This paper describes the development of a mouse MAb, JF5, that binds to a protein epitope present on an extracellular glycoprotein antigen secreted constitutively during the active growth of A. fumigatus. The MAb was used to develop an immunochromatographic lateral-flow device (LFD) for the rapid (15-min) detection of Aspergillus antigens in human serum. The test is highly specific, reacting with antigens from Aspergillus species but not with antigens from a large number of clinically important fungi, including Candida species, Cryptococcus neoformans, Fusarium solani, Penicillium marneffei, Pseudallescheria boydii, and Rhizopus oryzae. The LFD was able to detect circulating antigen in serum samples from patients suspected of having or shown to have IA on the basis of their clinical symptoms and results from tests for GM and fungal (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan. The ease of use of the LFD provides a diagnostic platform for the routine testing of vulnerable patients who have an elevated risk of IA.",2008,18463222,no
Clinical presentation and pathology of sarcocystosis in psittaciform birds: 11 cases.,"Sarcocystosis in psittaciform birds occurs in several different presentations, making ante-mortem diagnosis challenging without specific laboratory tests. This study followed the course of 11 birds diagnosed with sarcocystosis by serologic analysis and/or post-mortem examinations during a 10-month period in 2006-07. The disease presented in three different clinical forms: an acute pulmonary disease (three birds), muscular disease (five), and neurological disease (three). Early diagnosis of sarcocystosis was possible through the combined used of plasma protein electrophoresis and indirect fluorescent antibody serology in birds presented with the neurological and muscular forms of the disease. In three of these birds the plasma electrophoretic patterns revealed marked hypergammaglobulinemia. All of the birds that presented with the acute pulmonary form developed similar gross and microscopic lesions. Definitive diagnosis was ultimately made by microscopic observation of intravascular pulmonary schizonts containing merozoites. Schizonts were identified in the cerebellum and brainstem in two birds with the neurological form of disease. Those birds that initially presented with severe lethargy and weakness were considered to suffer from the muscular form of disease if they had extreme elevations of muscle enzyme activities (creatine phosphokinase, aspartate aminotransferase) and beta and gamma globulins concentrations, and were seropositive for antibodies to Sarcocystis falcatula. In this group the progression of the disease varied. Two birds recovered completely, and secondary aspergillosis was diagnosed in three birds. The histopathological lesions observed are discussed and interpreted in light of earlier findings from experimental infections in budgerigars, which provide insights into the natural course of sarcocystosis in psittaciform birds.",2008,18459322,no
Health evaluation of free-ranging Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) in Peru.,"As part of ongoing ecological studies of Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) at Punta San Juan, Ica Department, Peru, health surveys were conducted in November 1992, 1993, and 1994. In the three surveys, 98 birds in total were handled for examination, and blood was collected for laboratory analysis from 90 of these birds. All birds seemed to be in good condition. Body weights of females were significantly lower in 1994 than in the other years. Fleas (Parapsyllus humboldti) and ticks (Ornithodoros amblus) were found on the penguins and in their nests. Females had significantly higher plasma calcium and phosphorus levels, and they had lower weights than males. No other differences were found between the sexes. Hematology, plasma chemistries, and plasma mineral levels varied between years.

Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase-independent resistance to Aspergillus fumigatus in alveolar macrophages.,"The fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus is responsible for increasing numbers of fatal infections in immune-compromised humans. Alveolar macrophages (AM) are important in the innate defense against aspergillosis, but little is known about their molecular responses to fungal conidia in vivo. We examined transcriptional changes and superoxide release by AM from C57BL/6 and gp91(phox)(-/-) mice in response to conidia. Following introduction of conidia into the lung, microarray analysis of AM showed the transcripts most strongly up-regulated in vivo to encode chemokines and additional genes that play a critical role in neutrophil and monocyte recruitment, indicating that activation of phagocytes represents a critical early response of AM to fungal conidia. Of the 73 AM genes showing > or = 2-fold changes, 8 were also increased in gp91(phox)(-/-) mice by conidia and in C57BL/6 mice by polystyrene beads, suggesting a common innate response to particulate matter. Ingenuity analysis of the microarray data from C57BL/6 mice revealed immune cell signaling and gene expression as primary mechanisms of this response. Despite the well-established importance of phagocyte NADPH oxidase in resisting aspergillosis, we found no evidence of this mechanism in AM following introduction of conidia into the mouse lung using transcriptional, luminometry, or NBT staining analysis. In support of these findings, we observed that AM from C57BL/6 and gp91(phox)(-/-) mice inhibit conidial germination equally in vitro. Our results indicate that early transcription in mouse AM exposed to conidia in vivo targets neutrophil recruitment, and that NADPH oxidase-independent mechanisms in AM contribute to inhibition of conidial germination.",2008,18453606,no
Fungal brain infections.,"Fungal infections of the central nervous system, once a relatively rare occurrence, are increasingly common due to the expansion of immunocompromised populations at risk, and therefore are important to recognize early and manage appropriately.The specific infectious risk posed by novel immune-modifying therapies can, in most cases, be predicted on the basis of the immune target and medication timing. In addition, major advances in noninvasive diagnostic tests (e.g. serum beta glucan and galactomannan assays), and the recent introduction of more effective antifungal therapies, have led to a dramatic improvement in clinical outcomes.The current review provides approaches to patients with suspected central nervous system fungal infections based on host-risk factors, clinical syndromes and specific pathogens.",2008,18451721,no
[Investigation of the effect of constructions in hospital environment on the crucial units for immunocompromised patients and the development of opportunistic mold infections].,"This study was planned to determine the effect of building constructions in and around our hospital, on the development of opportunistic mold infections in immunocompromised patients hospitalized in bone marrow and kidney transplantation units and haematology and oncology units. Samples were collected from high risk units by an air sampler (Air Ideal) from indoors and outdoors of a total of 43 patient rooms. The most commonly isolated species from indoor air cultures of our hospital were Penicillium spp. (50.6%), Cladosporium spp. (20%), Chrysonilia spp. (11%) and Aspergillus (10.6%) species. When outdoor samples were considered, Penicillium spp. (38.8%) was still in the first line, followed by Cladosporium spp. (24.3%), Paecillomyces spp. (10.7%) and Aspergillus (8.7%) species. There was no statistically significant difference of total colony and spore numbers between the samples obtained from indoor and outdoor air (p > 0.05), indicating the close relation with the construction studies in and around the hospital. Clinical samples including bronchoalveoler lavage (BAL) fluid, sputum, endotracheal aspirate and sinus tissue were collected from the total of 43 patients staying at these air sampled rooms, and eight of them (18.6%) yielded positivity for the growth of molds. Of them four were identified as Penicillium chrysogenum (sputum isolates), two as Aspergillus fumigatus (sputum and BAL isolates), one as Aspergillus flavus (BAL isolate), and one as Valsa sordida (sinus tissue) which is considered as a plant pathogen. A total of 53 sera, BAL, and tissue supernatant samples were screened by ELISA for the presence of galactomannan antigen, and five of the eight patients whose cultures were positive were also found positive for galactomannan antigen. One patient has died due to invasive aspergillosis whose BAL specimen and indoor air sample were positive for A. fumigatus. In evaluation of indoor air samples before and after the change of HEPA filters, statistically significant decrease was detected in total colony and spore numbers between the samples taken before and after the filter changes (p < 0.005). This study has emphasized the importance of examination of mold flora of indoor air and clinical samples of high risk group patients intermittantly, in order to prevent opportunistic mold infections in crucial units especially during hospital constructions.",2008,18444565,no
Contribution of new diagnostic approaches to antifungal treatment plans in high-risk haematology patients.,"In high-risk patient cohorts, such as patients after solid-organ or allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, or patients with acute leukaemia, early diagnosis of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) is essential, as delayed or missing diagnosis of IFI results in increasing rates of mortality. However, diagnosis of most IFIs, especially of invasive aspergillosis, is difficult because classic tests have low sensitivity and specificity, and radiology often provides non-specific and transient results. The limited sensitivity and specificity of conventional assays for the detection of IFI and the growing number of immunocompromised patients who are at risk for opportunistic fungal infections have led to the development of new assays. These methods include antigen detection systems, such as ELISAs, and different molecular methods (PCR assays). Serological tests, such as the detection of the carbohydrate galactomannan, are standardised and commercially available. However, they still need to be evaluated in large patient cohorts, especially children. The benefit of antibody detection remains unclear if patients are under immune suppression or are heavily colonised but not infected. A range of different PCR assays (conventional, nested, real-time) have been developed, targeting different gene regions (cytochrome P450, heat-shock proteins, 18S, 5.8S, 28S, internal transcribed spacer), including a variety of amplicon detection methods, such as gel electrophoresis, hybridisation with specific probes, ELISA and restriction fragment length polymorphism. These molecular assays provide high potential in terms of sensitivity and specificity, but vary widely in their feasibility and up to now have not been standardised. Taken together, new non-culture-based diagnostic assays are appropriate as simple and rapid screening tests with high sensitivities and quick turnaround times. Thus, they might help to reduce empirical antifungal therapy and might be valuable tools to allow early initiation and monitoring of pre-emptive antifungal therapy.

Fungal infections in lung transplant recipients.,"Despite numerous advances in lung transplantation, survival is still significantly compromised by a higher rate of infections. This review intends to provide an overview of the most common fungal infections afflicting lung transplant recipients, focusing on the most recent developments in diagnosis, therapy and prophylaxis.Although detection of galactomannan in serum has poor sensitivity for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in lung transplant recipients, detection of galactomannan in the bronchoalveolar lavage of a lung transplant recipient, with a compatible clinical illness, is highly suggestive of invasive disease. New antifungal agents, with a broader spectrum of activity and a more tolerable side effect profile, have become available for the treatment and prophylaxis of fungal infections. Evidence suggests that, at least for voriconazole, monitoring of drug concentrations may be advisable to prevent clinical failure due to underdosing and toxicity due to excessive dosing.Fungal infections remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in lung transplant recipients however, advances have been made in the recent years, which will allow earlier diagnosis and more effective and tolerated treatment.",2008,18427244,no
Fungal proteases induce Th2 polarization through limited dendritic cell maturation and reduced production of IL-12.,"Allergens are capable of polarizing the T cell immune response toward a Th2 cytokine profile in a process that is mediated by dendritic cells (DCs). Proteases derived from Aspergillus species (Aspergillus proteases AP) have been shown to induce a Th2-like immune response when administered directly to the airway and without adjuvant or prior priming immunizations at sites remote from the lung in models of allergic airway disease. To explore mechanisms that underlie the Th2 immune response, we have investigated the effect of AP on DC function. We found that human DCs derived from CD14(+) monocytes from healthy donors underwent partial maturation when incubated with AP. Naive allogeneic T cells primed with AP-activated DCs proliferated and displayed enhanced production of IL-4 and reduced expression of IFN-gamma as compared with naive T cells primed with LPS-activated DCs. Global gene expression analysis of DCs revealed relatively low expression of IL-12p40 in AP-activated DCs as compared with those activated by LPS, and this was confirmed at the protein level by ELISA. Exogenous IL-12p70 added to cocultures of DCs and T cells resulted in reduced IL-4 and increased IFN-gamma expression when DCs were activated with AP. When the proteolytic activity of AP was neutralized by chemical inactivation it failed to up-regulate costimulatory molecules on DCs, and these DCs did not prime a Th2 response in naive T cells. These findings provide a mechanism for explaining how proteolytically active allergens could preferentially induce Th2 responses through limited maturation of DCs with reduced production of IL-12.",2008,18424720,no
Strong correlation between serum aspergillus galactomannan index and outcome of aspergillosis in patients with hematological cancer: clinical and research implications.,"Galactomannan is an Aspergillus-specific polysaccharide released during aspergillosis and is detected by the quantitative serum galactomannan index (GMI) test. Preclinical and preliminary clinical reports have suggested a good correlation between GMI and aspergillosis outcome.We reviewed the literature to assess the strength of correlation between GMI and aspergillosis outcome using the kappa correlation coefficient. We included 27 studies that enrolled patients with hematological cancer and proven or probable aspergillosis and that used sequential GMI testing. We examined the 3 following outcomes: survival (survival vs. death), global outcome (survival vs. death [including autopsy findings]), and autopsy outcome (autopsy findings only).Overall, 257 patients fulfilled criteria for proven or probable aspergillosis and were eligible for outcome evaluation. Correlation between GMI (within <or=1 week before outcome) and defined outcomes was excellent, with kappa correlation coefficients of 0.8737 (95% confidence interval, 0.8140-0.9333 P<.001) and 0.9123 (95% confidence interval, 0.8617-0.9629We conclude that serum GMI is a good marker of aspergillosis outcome.",2008,18419445,no
Functional equivalence of translation factor eIF5B from Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5B (eIF5B) plays a role in recognition of the AUG codon in conjunction with translation factor eIF2, and promotes joining of the 60S ribosomal subunit. To see whether the eIF5B proteins of other organisms function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we cloned the corresponding genes from Oryza sativa, Arabidopsis thaliana, Aspergillus nidulans and Candida albican and expressed them under the control of the galactose-inducible GAL promoter in the fun12Delta strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Expression of Candida albicans eIF5B complemented the slow-growth phenotype of the fun12Delta strain, but that of Aspergillus nidulance did not, despite the fact that its protein was expressed better than that of Candida albicans. The Arabidopsis thaliana protein was also not functional in Saccharomyces. These results reveal that the eIF5B in Candida albicans has a close functional relationship with that of Sacharomyces cerevisiae, as also shown by a phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequences of the eIF5Bs.",2008,18414002,no
"Prokaryotic expression, purification and characterization of Aspergillus sulphureus beta-mannanase and site-directed mutagenesis of the catalytic residues.","Wild type (WT) DNA sequence, which encoded a mature beta-mannanase of Aspergillus sulphureus, composed of 1,152 nucleotides (nt), was amplified from pUCm-T-mann by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Based on this DNA fragment, mutants designated as E(206)G and E(314)G were constructed by overextension PCR (OE-PCR). Glutamic acids of the 206th and 314th sites in the amino acid sequence of beta-mannanase were separately replaced by glycine in these two mutants. The WT and mutant genes were ligated into prokaryotic vector pET-28a (+) and transformed into the Escherichia coli BL21 strain, respectively. The recombinant enzyme proteins were expressed by IPTG induction and detected by Western blot. The recombinant proteins purified with Ni-NTA column were dialyzed to correctly refold. The WT recombinant beta-mannanase showed optimal activity at 50 degrees C and pH 2.4. The kinetic parameters of K (m) and V (max) for purified beta-mannanase were 1.38 mg/ml and 72.99 U/mg, respectively. However, the mutant proteins did not show any activity. It was demonstrated that E(206) and E(314) were the catalytic residues of beta-mannanase.",2008,18401744,no
Application relevant studies of fungal beta-galactosidases with potential application in the alleviation of lactose intolerance.,"Functional screening studies revealed that Aspergillus carbonarius ATCC6276 produced extracellular beta-galactosidase activity potentially suited for use as a lactase digestive supplement in the treatment of lactose intolerance. The crude preparation contained two beta-galactosidase activities, beta-gal 1 and beta-gal 2, which were separated by ion-exchange chromatography. Both enzymes were purified to homogeneity by a combination of gel filtration, ion-exchange, chromatofocusing and hydrophobic interaction chromatographies. beta-gal 1 and beta-gal 2 displayed differences in molecular mass (110 kDa versus 120 kDa as judged by SDS PAGE) and in a range of additional physicochemical properties. Km values of 83 and 309 mM, respectively, were recorded using lactose as substrate while temperature optima of 55 degrees C versus 65 degrees C were obtained. Unlike current commercialized supplemental lactases, both of the purified enzymes displayed significant stability when exposed to simulated gastric conditions, with beta-gal 1 in particular retaining 70% residual activity after exposure to pH 2.0 in the presence of pepsin for 2 h. Overall the results indicate that the beta-galactosidases of Aspergillus carbonarius ATCC6276, either individually or in combination, may be suitable for use as a digestive supplement for the alleviation of lactose intolerance.",2008,18401743,no
[The use of galactomannan detection in diagnosing invasive aspergillosis in hemato-oncological patients].,"PREMISES AND OBJECTIVES: Timely diagnosis is of critical importance for the prognosis of invasive aspergilosis (IA) patients. Over recent years, IA detection of galactomannan using the ELISA method has assumed growing importance. The objective of the study was to analyse the usability of the method in current clinical practice of a hemato-oncological ward.From May 2003 to October 2006, blood samples were taken from patients at IA risk to detect galactomannan (GM) in serum using the ELISA method. The patients who underwent the tests were classified by the probability of IA presence on the basis of the results of conventional diagnostic methods and section findings.A total of 11,360 serum samples from 911 adult patients were tested for GM presence. IA (probable/proven) was diagnosed in 42 (4.6%) of them. The rates of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of galactomannan detection for IA diagnosis in our ward were, respectively, 95.2%, 90.0%, 31.5% and 99.7%. The principal causes of the limited positive predictive value of the test were the high percentage of false-positive test results (mainly caused by concomitant administration of some penicillin antibiotics or Plasma-Lyte infusion solution), as well as the fact that a large percentage of patients we examined fell within the group of patients with hematological malignity with a very low prevalence of IA.GM detection in serum is associated with high sensitivity and excellent negative predictive value in IA diagnosis in hemato-oncological patients. Knowledge and elimination of possible causes of false-positive results as well as focusing the screening on patients at greatest risk of infection are necessary for an even better exploitation of the test.",2008,18390117,no
Triggering of toll-like receptors 2 and 4 by Aspergillus fumigatus conidia in immortalized human corneal epithelial cells to induce inflammatory cytokines.,"Cornea epithelial cells play early and crucial roles in the initiation of ocular surface responses to pathogens. Participation of toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4, which are major forms of fungi receptors, may be involved in Aspergillus fumigatus induced immune responses. The objective of the present study was to examine whether inactive Aspergillus fumigatus conidia induce NF-kappaB activation and production of proinflammatory cytokines, and whether the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 were amplified by conidia in cultured immortalized human corneal epithelial cells (THCEs). This may contribute to our knowledge of the mechanism by which the host cornea can successfully defend against invasive fungi.Aspergillus fumigatus conidia were used to challenge THCE cells. THCE cells were harvested after 0.5, 1, 2 or 4 hours incubation. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed to determine the expression of TLR2, TLR4, TNF-alpha and IL-8. Western blotting was performed to determine the expression of NF-kappaB. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to determine the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-8. And the release of TNF-alpha and IL-8 in the cell supernatant were also assessed by ELISA with or without pretreatment with TLR2 and TLR4 neutralizing antibodies.Aspergillus fumigatus conidia elicited the expression of TLR2, TLR4, TNF-alpha and IL-8 mRNA in THCEs. Exposure of THCE cells to Aspergillus fumigatus conidia resulted in NF-kappaB activation, which increased at 30 minutes (increased from 11.35+/-2.74 in the controls to 19.12+/-3.48, P<0.05) and thereafter increased steadily up to 4 hours after challenge (P<0.01). Concomitant with NF-kappaB activation, secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-8 in conidia-challenged cells was increased in a time-dependent manner. Incubation of THCE cells with TLR2 antibody or TLR4 antibody before conidia challenge resulted in inhibition of conidia-induced TNF-alpha and IL-8 secretion (P<0.05), TLR2 antibody and TLR4 antibody together significantly increased inhibition of the conidia-induced secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-8 from THCE cells (P<0.01).Aspergillus fumigatus conidia stimulates THCEs inflammatory response through a pathway dependent on TLR2 and TLR4 signaling.",2008,18364120,no
Vacuolar serine protease is a major allergen of Cladosporium cladosporioides.,"Cladosporium is an important allergenic fungus worldwide. We report here a major allergen of C. cladosporioides.Major C. cladosporioides allergens were characterized by immunoblotting, N-terminal amino acid sequencing, protein purification and cDNA cloning.Seventy-four sera (38%) from 197 bronchial asthmatic patients demonstrated IgE binding against C. cladosporioides extracts. Among these 74 sera, 41 (55%) and 38 (51%) showed IgE binding against a 36- and a 20-kDa protein of C. cladosporioides, respectively. Both IgE-reacting components reacted with FUM20, a monoclonal antibody against fungal serine proteases. N-terminal amino acid sequencing results suggest that they are vacuolar serine proteases, and the 20-kDa component is possibly a degraded product of the 36-kDa allergen. A corresponding 5'-truncated 1,425-bp cDNA fragment was isolated. The mature protein after N-terminal processing starts with an N-terminal serine that is the ninth residue encoded by the 5'-truncated cDNA. The protein sequence deduced shares 69-72% sequence identity with Penicillium vacuolar serine proteases and was designated as Cla c 9. The purified 36-kDa Cla c 9 allergen showed proteolytic activity with peptide Z-Ala-Ala-Leu-pNA as substrate. IgE cross-reactivity was detected between the purified Cla c 9 and serine protease allergens from Aspergillusfumigatus and Penicillium chrysogenum.We identified a vacuolar serine protease as a major allergen of C. cladosporioides (Cla c 9) and a major pan-allergen of prevalent airborne fungi. IgE cross-reactivity among these highly conserved serine protease pan-fungal allergens was also detectable.",2008,18362473,no
[Mycotoxin research in humans].,"This study investigates the occurrence of aflatoxins in Ecuador. Early investigators proved the presence of aflatoxins in human and animal food, but the disturbing data lead to the formation of two research teams at Guayaquil University and the Agrarian University of Ecuador to investigate aflaxotins and other mycotoxins in food and their relationship to human health. Because the concept of mycotoxicosis as a result of the secondary metabolites produced by different species of moulds could cause different clinical patterns, the research team includes Aspergillus metabolites found in the urine of a patient with pulmonary aspergilloma. We considered that the body itself could create secondary metabolites. An ELISA method was used to detect mycotoxins with the specific reactive compounds using a company base assay. This allows the detection quantitative of such metabolites in 24 h collected urine. The patient was treated with itraconazole for nine months, after clinical, radiological and aflatoxins testing. We also investigated three other cases in children with a second level of malnutrition and only with vomitoxins results and in three investigated cases of otomycosis caused by Aspergillus niger only in one case traces of aflatoxins were found.",2008,18338920,no
Assessment of the lightcycler PCR assay for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in paediatric patients with onco-haematological diseases.,"A reliable diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) is hampered by the difficulty in obtaining suitable tissue samples. To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the LightCycler PCR for the diagnosis of IA, 536 blood samples were collected over a 22-month period from 62 paediatric patients (median age 10 years, range 1-18) considered at risk of IA. The galactomannan antigen (GM) and fungal DNA were assessed on serial blood samples. IA was diagnosed in eight of 62 patients (13%): proven, five, probable, three. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of LightCycler PCR varied according to the number of positive samples used to define positivity: 88% 37%",2008,18331444,no
Broad-spectrum antifungal prophylaxis in patients with cancer at high risk for invasive mold infections: counterpoint.,"Management of invasive mold infections in patients with prolonged neutropenia and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) has been hampered by the difficulty in diagnosing these infections. Definite diagnosis invariably centers on histologic identification of hyphae in tissue or on culture from a sterile body site. Therefore, most practitioners have relied on prophylaxis and empiric therapy. Currently, emphasis is shifting from routine prophylaxis and empiric therapy to screening of patients with neutropenia at high risk so that clinicians can administer appropriate antifungal therapy early, when it can potentially improve patient outcome. Non-culture-based microbiologic tools are at the forefront of this paradigm shift. Commercially available methods to detect fungal antigens and sophisticated techniques to detect fungal DNA may be used as screening tools during the highest risk period. Together with assessment of clinical signs, cultures, and especially CT scanning, these methods are useful for starting antifungal therapy preemptively. While awaiting further evaluation of these tools during the postengraftment period of allogeneic HSCT, mold-active prophylaxis targeting the subgroup of patients with severe acute or chronic GVHD may be justified. However, some critical issues have not yet been adequately addressed, including the generalizability of study results, impact of mucositis and gastrointestinal GVHD on drug bioavailability, need for therapeutic drug monitoring, impact of prophylaxis on the performance of diagnostic assays, and optimal treatment of breakthrough invasive fungal infections.",2008,18319050,no
[How to produce research information from the clinical laboratory--review of our research on the cytological diagnosis of aspergillosis].,"We have evaluated the significance of the cytopathological diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis using touch smears or lavage fluid obtained by the bronchoscopic examination. Thirty five cases of aspergillosis were diagnosed through the cytological examination of bronchoscopic specimens with abundant neutrophils or necrotic debris from 211 patients. Thirty three of these 35 cases were non-invasive or semi-invasive and the remaining two cases were allergic aspergillosis. Aspergilli could be cultivated from the bronchoscopic specimen only in 34% of these 35 cases. Serum beta-D glucan and galactomannan were elevated in 27% and 12% respectively. Although 92% of these 35 cases had high titer of aspergillus antibody, less than 40% of them had been suspected to be aspergillosis at the time of bronchoscopic examinations. These data clearly indicates that cytopathological examination is quite effective to make the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis especially in the clinically unsuspected cases. Our experimental study revealed that Papanicolou's staining is able to color the cytoplasm of the fungal hyphae but ineffective to demonstrate empty wall of the degenerated hyphae. In our 35 aspergillosis, hyphae are frequently invisible in the slides stained with Papanicolou's method (21/35), because of the degenerative change. However, degenerated hyphae of these 21 cases were clearly demonstrated by special stain for fungi. In conclusion, application of the fungal stain to the bronchial cytological slides rich in neutrophils and/or necrotic debris is revealed to have clinical significance for the accurate diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis.",2008,18318232,no
Quick and reliable galactomannan detection in crude minced lung specimens from haematological patients with suspected invasive fungal infection: results from a case series.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is the leading direct or contributory cause of death in patients with haematological malignancies. Early diagnosis remains difficult and often elusive due the heterogeneity of clinical presentations and the low sensitivity of both histological examination and cultures of specimens obtained from patients at risk. We report two cases of IA, both of which lacked both histological and cultural evidence of IA from pulmonary specimens. In both patients, detection of galactomannan (GM) by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) on pulmonary tissue homogenates led to the diagnosis of IA, which was confirmed by Aspergillus DNA (real time PCR). In conclusion, we provide preliminary evidence that lung homogenates may be prepared for GM EIA assays, which may contribute to quick diagnosis of IA on otherwise negative samples. We feel that our results open up the opportunity of a prospective and comparative evaluation of this diagnostic technique.",2008,18317823,no
Identification of spore allergens from the indoor mould Aspergillus versicolor.,"Indoor mould growth and dampness are associated with respiratory health effects and allergies and several studies demonstrated that mainly Aspergillus versicolor and Penicillium expansum are responsible for indoor mould exposure. In contrast, commercialized test systems to diagnose allergic reactions to this mould species are not available. In this study, allergenic proteins from spores of the indoor relevant species A. versicolor and P. expansum should get detected and identified.We used two-dimensional (2D)-gel electrophoresis of spore proteins and immunoblotting with sera from patients participating in an epidemiologic study about indoor exposure of moulds and their influence on the development of allergies (ESTERSPEGA). Sera were screened for IgE antibodies specific for proteins from A. versicolor, A. fumigatus and P. expansum in one-dimensional blots and in 2D immunoblots. From the 2D gels, the corresponding spots were picked and identified by mass spectrometry.More than 20 allergens from A. versicolor were identified in particular, seven major allergens were selected, which were detected by more than 90% of the positive sera. The most abundant allergen was glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, followed by an unnamed protein, which displays a high homology to sobitol/xylose reductase. The other allergens were identified as catalase A, hypothetical protein AN6918.2, enolase, hypothetical protein AN0297.2 and a protein with homology to a fungal malate dehydrogenase.The results indicate an important role of spore proteins from A. versicolor for sensitization against indoor moulds and identification of the major allergens might enable species-specific diagnosis of allergic reactions.",2008,18315733,no
Konjac glucomannan/xanthan gum enzyme sensitive binary mixtures for colonic drug delivery.,"The polysaccharide konjac glucomannan (KGM) is degraded in the colon but not the small intestine, which makes it potentially useful as an excipient for colonic drug delivery. With xanthan gum (XG) KGM forms thermoreversible gels with hitherto unexplored biodegradation properties. In this work, rheological measurements of KGM and KGM/XG systems incubated with and without Aspergillus niger beta-mannanase (used to mimic colonic enzymes) showed that KGM was degraded by the enzyme even when interacting with XG. Tablets with KGM/XG/sucrose matrices that varied in accordance with a simplex design and bore diltiazem as a typical highly soluble drug load were prepared by wet granulation, and in most cases were found to possess satisfactory mechanical strength and exhibit slow, nearly zero-order drug release. Drug release from these tablets remained zero-order, but was accelerated (presumably due to degradation of KGM), in the presence of A. niger beta-mannanase at concentrations equivalent to human colonic conditions. However, marked differences between Japanese and American varieties of KGM as regards degree of acetylation and particle size led to significant differences in swelling rate and drug release between formulations prepared with one and the other KGM: whereas a formulation with Japanese KGM released its entire drug load within 24h in the presence of beta-mannanase, only 60% release was achieved under the same conditions by the corresponding formulation with American KGM, suggesting that with this KGM it will be necessary to optimize technological variables such as compression pressure in order to achieve suitable porosity, swelling rate, and drug release. To sum up, the results of this study suggest that sustained release of water-soluble drugs in the colon from orally administered tablets may be achieved using simple, inexpensive formulations based on combinations of KGM and XG that take the variability of KGM characteristics into account.",2008,18294827,no
Improved detection of circulating Aspergillus antigen by use of a modified pretreatment procedure.,"Detection of circulating galactofuranose (galf) antigens, including galactomannan (GM), by the Platelia Aspergillus (PA) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is an important tool in the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA). We used a modified pretreatment technique (MT) on consecutive negative PA ELISA plasma samples from IA patients in order to improve the detection of the fungal components present. Plasma samples (52) were collected from healthy donors, and 174 plasma samples with a galactomannan index (GMI) below 0.5 were collected from 25 unclassifiable and 23 IA patients. The PA ELISA reactivity of pretreated samples was determined before (conventional technique [CT]) and after (MT) filtration using a Microcon filter with a 50-kDa cutoff (Millipore). For the MT, the sensitivity of the PA ELISA increased from 42.9% (CT) to 78.6% (MT) using a cutoff for the GMI of 1.5 in the probable and proven group, whereas specificity slightly decreased from 98.7% to 96.1% in the control group. The 10-fold concentration step increased the GMI as high as 121-fold. The MT resulted not only in positive reactivity in samples that tested negative with the CT but also in the earlier detection of antigen by 2 to 17 days.",2008,18287324,no
Mycotoxin analysis: an update.,"Mycotoxin contamination of cereals and related products used for feed can cause intoxication, especially in farm animals. Therefore, efficient analytical tools for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of toxic fungal metabolites in feed are required. Current methods usually include an extraction step, a clean-up step to reduce or eliminate unwanted co-extracted matrix components and a separation step with suitably specific detection ability. Quantitative methods of analysis for most mycotoxins use immunoaffinity clean-up with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation in combination with UV and/or fluorescence detection. Screening of samples contaminated with mycotoxins is frequently performed by thin layer chromatography (TLC), which yields qualitative or semi-quantitative results. Nowadays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are often used for rapid screening. A number of promising methods, such as fluorescence polarization immunoassays, dipsticks, and even newer methods such as biosensors and non-invasive techniques based on infrared spectroscopy, have shown great potential for mycotoxin analysis. Currently, there is a strong trend towards the use of multi-mycotoxin methods for the simultaneous analysis of several of the important Fusarium mycotoxins, which is best achieved by LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry). This review focuses on recent developments in the determination of mycotoxins with a special emphasis on LC-MS/MS and emerging rapid methods.",2008,18286405,no
[Evaluation of the galactomannan assay for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in an animal model].,"To assess the value of Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) double-direct sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA).Ninety adult SD rats were randomly divided into 5 groups, including 4 groups of pulmonary infection by Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus), Candida albicans, mucor, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively, and a colonization group by A. fumigatus in the pharynx oralis (n = 18 each). For the infection models, suspensions of pathogenic bacteria and fungi were instilled into the lungs of the rats by tracheal intubation. For the colonization model, the suspension of A. fumigatus was applied to the nasal cavity and pharynx oralis of the rats. The animals were sacrificed on days 3, 7, and 12 after inoculation, and blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture and used for GM detection. The lung tissues were prepared for routine pathology examination, and hexamethylene tetramine silver staining was used to detect the fungi. A double-direct sandwich ELISA was employed to detect GM optical density index in the serum samples.The lung tissues of rats infected with A. fumigatus, Candida albicans, mucor and Streptococcus pneumoniae all showed remarkable inflammatory reactions, and hyphae were observed in rats with fungal infection (including A. fumigatus and mucor), and spores in rats infected with Candida albicans. The lung tissues of the A. fumigatus colonization rats showed no inflammatory reactions. The serum GM optical density index of the groups infected with A. fumigatus, Candida albicans, mucor and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the A. fumigatus colonization group were 1.69 +/- 0.29, 0.89 +/- 0.46, 0.87 +/- 0.39, 0.77 +/- 0.34 and 0.90 +/- 0.49, respectively. The serum GM optical density index of the IPA group was higher than those of the other 4 groups (P < 0.05). If the cutoff ODI was 1.5, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for diagnosis of IPA in the rats were 78.6%, 87.5%, 57.9% and 94.9%, respectively. The sensitivity for A. fumigatus infection on days 3, 7, and 12 was 60.0%, 80% and 100%, and the specificity was 95.5%, 81.0% and 85.7%, respectively.GM detection could distinguish Aspergillus infection from Candida albicans, mucor, Streptococcus pneumoniae infection and Aspergillus colonization. The sensitivity of the test for the diagnosis of IPA tended to be higher with longer duration of infection. A cutoff ODI of 1.5 showed the best sensitivity and specificity for IPA in this rat model.",2008,18269845,no
Changing landscape of invasive aspergillosis in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is an important infectious complication in allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients. Diagnosis of IA has been difficult and often delayed and treatment outcome has been poor, with mortality rates up to 80%. This review summarizes recent developments in this field. There are indications that the incidence of IA may be decreasing due to multiple factors including better understanding of pathogenesis of IA, earlier diagnosis, and various prophylactic and preventive strategies. Recently posaconazole has shown to be effective in reducing the risk of IA in patients treated for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Early use of high-resolution thoracic computed tomography assisted with complimentary methods including bronchoalveolar lavage and serum galactomannan determinations are useful in early diagnosis. Our treatment armamentarium against IA has broadened significantly during the last years and there are some indications of improved outcome more recently. On the other hand, increasing use of blood progenitor grafts instead of marrow with higher risk of chronic GVHD, increasing age of SCT recipients, and wide use of donor lymphocyte infusions for treatment of minimal residual disease or relapse may affect to the opposite direction. Despite some promises and improvements, IA will continue to remain a challenge in the upcoming years.",2008,18266785,no
Current and future therapeutic options in the management of invasive aspergillosis.,"The past decade has witnessed significant progress in the management of invasive aspergillosis. Potent, relatively non-toxic antifungal drugs, data on early chest CT scanning and the availability of a non-invasive diagnostic test (serum galactomannan) are the key advances among these, the contribution of the recently available drugs is the most significant. Safer and earlier intervention resulting in reduced mortality and improved outcome is being demonstrated. Newer strategies enable clinicians to provide drug therapy in a highly targeted manner, such that empirical use of antifungal drugs may decline. Voriconazole has become the drug of choice for primary therapy, while posaconazole shows promise as a prophylactic drug. Echinocandins are effective for salvage therapy and are under evaluation for primary therapy. Preliminary data for efficacy of combination therapy with a mould-active azole plus an echinocandin are of promise and clinical trials are under way. Reports of emergence of less-susceptible Aspergillus spp. during azole therapy are of concern and close monitoring is needed. Remarkably, the era of polyenes appears to be nearing the end in the therapy of invasive aspergillosis. The promise of newer classes of drugs, immune-modulating therapies and vaccines are exciting future additions to the arsenal against invasive aspergillosis.",2008,18257606,no
"Detection of Aspergillus fumigatus-specific DNA, (1-3)-beta-D-glucan and galactomannan in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens of experimentally infected rats.","The aim of this study was to detect Aspergillus fumigatus-specific DNA by nested PCR (nPCR) in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens of experimentally infected rats and compare the results with (1-3)-beta-D-glucan (BDG) and galactomannan (GM) detection. Sixty Wistar rats, immunosuppressed with an intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide (70 mg kg(-1)) were infected with 1 x 10(6)A. fumigatus conidia. The rats were killed on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 postinfection in groups of six each and their BAL, blood and lungs were cultured. The A. fumigatus-specific DNA, BDG and GM in serum and BAL were detected by nPCR, Fungitell kit and Aspergillus Platelia kit respectively. Base line values were obtained by using sera from six healthy rats. Except the lungs, blood and BAL specimens of all the infected rats were negative for A. fumigatus culture. The BDG, GM and nPCR positivity in serum specimens was 80%, 77% and 63% respectively. The sensitivity of GM and nPCR tests in BAL specimens was 77% and 70% respectively. The data suggest that BDG and GM appear early in the course of infection, and have similar kinetics (r = 0.483, P = 0.007). Hence, their combined detection could be useful in the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.",2008,18254749,no
Characterization of monoclonal antibodies to an antigenic protein from Stachybotrys chartarum and its measurement in house dust.,"Using sera from atopic patients we have isolated an extracellular protein, which is antigenic in humans, from Stachybotrys chartarum sesu lato. Here we report the production of monoclonal antibodies to the protein and the development of a sensitive and specific assay to the target protein as well as analyses in house dust samples spiked with spores. The detection limit for the target antigen in house dust was approximately 0.2 ng/g dry weight house dust. This detection limit is comparable to those for house dust mite allergen and the allergen of the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus but lower than that for the fungus Alternaria alternata.",2008,18242638,no
"[Invasive aspergillosis in hematooncological patients: advantages and disadvantages of various diagnostic methods, treatment options and financial costs of therapy].","Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a leading invasive fungal infection in hematooncological patients. The aim of this study was to analyse the incidence, diagnostic procedures and treatment of IA in hematooncological department in large hospital in the Czech Republic.A retrospective analysis of medical and laboratory records from patients hospitalised in our department with proven/probable IA between January 2000 and December 2006 was performed.52 cases of IA in 51 patients were identified (17.3% proven IA/82.7% probable IA). Number of IA cases notably increased during study period (1 case of IA in 2000 vs 21 cases of IA in 2006) and majority of them was of nosocomial origin (61.5%). Pulmonary aspergillosis was diagnosed in 46 cases (88.5%). Patients treated for acute leukemia or undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation represent the group at the highest risk of IA (in total 52% of cases). Fever and signs of pulmonary involvement were the most common clinical signs of infection (presented in 92.3% and 69.2 cases respectively). Conventional diagnostic methods including autopsy were able to diagnose only 15 cases of IA (28.8%). In all other cases (71.2%) the diagnosis was done by detection of galactomannan (GM) in serum. Introduction of GM monitoring enabled erlier initiation of antifungal treatment by 4 days. Initial therapy of IA led to the treatment response (partial and complete) in 18 (34.6%) of infections--the highest percentage of response has been seen in voriconazole monotherapy group (42%) and when combination of voriconazole and caspofungin has been used (83%). Salvage therapy was initiated due to the failure of initial treatment in 21 (40.3%) of cases. Patients were treated mostly with combination ofvoriconazole and caspofungin and/or monotherapy with voriconazole has been used with treatment response 55% and 50% respectively. Introduction of new antifungal drugs together with increased number of patients with IA led to the marked increase of total costs spent on treatment of IA per year--from 11,5 thousands CZK in 2000 to 6,2 millions CZK in 2006.IA is the most frequent cause of infection-related mortality in patients with haematological malignancies. Routine use of non-culture base methods in diagnosis of IA together with treatment using new, effective antifungals can improve prognosis of patients with this life threatening infection.",2013,23687707,no
Aspergillus galactomannan testing in patients with long-term neutropenia: implications for clinical management.,"We carried out a prospective study on galactomannan enzyme immuno assay (GEI) (Platelia Aspergillus EIA, Bio-Rad) testing for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in serum and broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) in 200 patients with hematological malignancies and profound neutropenia. The incidence of proven and probable IA was 6% and 5.5%, respectively. In patients with fever or pneumonia, a single-positive GEI test result (galactomannan index >or= 0.5) had excellent specificity (100%). Sensitivity was relatively low (40%) at onset of fever, but increased to 94.7% after 6 days of fever. In patients with infiltrates in chest X-ray or computed tomography scan (n = 48), GEI testing in BAL had a favorable diagnostic accuracy as compared with GEI testing in serum (sensitivity 100% versus 71%). Our findings indicate that antifungal therapy should be started immediately at onset of fever in neutropenic patients with positive GEI tests. In patients with fever refractory to broad-spectrum antibiotics (>or=6 days of fever), the high diagnostic accuracy makes GEI testing a valuable diagnostic tool and questions the common strategy to carry out antifungal treatment irrespective of diagnostic testing in this situation. Our data also show that GEI testing in BAL can be useful for early diagnosis of IA in patients with hematological malignancies and pulmonary infiltrates.",2008,18227109,no
Trichophyton rubrum secreted and membrane-associated carboxypeptidases.,"Dermatophytes are the most common agents of superficial mycoses, and exclusively infect stratum corneum, nails or hair. Therefore, secreted proteolytic activity is considered a virulence trait of these fungi. In a medium containing protein as a sole nitrogen and carbon source Trichophyton rubrum secretes a metallocarboxypeptidase (TruMcpA) of the M14 family according to the MEROPS proteolytic enzyme database. TruMcpA is homologous to human pancreatic carboxypeptidase A, and is synthesized as a precursor in a preproprotein form. The propeptide is removed to generate the mature active enzyme alternatively by either one of two subtilisins which are concomitantly secreted by the fungus. In addition, T. rubrum was shown to possess two genes (TruSCPA and TruSCPB) encoding serine carboxypeptidases of the S10 family which are homologues of the previously characterized Aspergillus and Penicillium secreted acid carboxypeptidases. However, in contrast to the Aspergillus and Penicillium homologues, TruScpA and TruScpB enzymes are not secreted into the environment, but are membrane-associated with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. During infection, T. rubrum secreted and GPI-anchored carboxypeptidases may contribute to fungal virulence by cooperating with previously characterized endoproteases and aminopeptidases in the degradation of compact keratinized tissues into assimilable amino acids and short peptides.",2008,18222721,no
Caspofungin prolongs survival of transiently neutropenic rats with advanced-stage invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.,"A high-dose-step-down strategy for caspofungin treatment was evaluated in an experimental model of advanced-stage invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The therapeutic efficacy of caspofungin in relation to the severity of invasive pulmonary infection caused by Aspergillus fumigatus in transiently neutropenic rats was investigated by using rat survival and the decrease in the fungal burden as the parameters of efficacy. When treatment was started at either 16 h or 24 h after fungal inoculation, caspofungin administered intraperitoneally at 4 mg/kg of body weight/day for 10 days was highly effective (100% and 93% rat survival, respectively). However, only 27% rat survival was obtained when treatment was started at 72 h, when the rats had advanced-stage infection. Increasing the dose from 4 to 10 mg/kg/day could compensate for the decrease in efficacy and resulted in 67% rat survival. The high dose of 10 mg/kg/day for 10 days did not appear to be necessary since a high-dose-step-down dosing schedule with 10 mg/kg/day for 3 days followed by 4 mg/kg/day for 7 days was equally effective. At 10 days after the end of treatment with 10 mg/kg/day caspofungin, the level of neither A. fumigatus DNA nor A. fumigatus galactomannan in the infected left lung was significantly decreased. In contrast, A. fumigatus galactomannan concentrations in serum were significantly decreased. The levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, alanine aminotransferase, and asparate aminotransferase were not elevated during treatment. Caspofungin is effective for the treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in transiently neutropenic rats and is even effective in rats with advanced-stage infection. In this model, the administration of high-dose-step-down treatment was as effective as treatment with high doses for the whole treatment period.",2008,18195059,no
Diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis by galactomannan antigenemia detection using an enzyme immunoassay.,"Invasive aspergillosis is a serious and often fatal infection in patients who are neutropenic or have undergone solid organ or stem cell transplantation. Delayed diagnosis and therapy may lead to poor outcomes. Diagnosis may be facilitated by a test for galactomannan antigen detection using an enzyme immunoassay. Other rapid methods for diagnosis include (1-->3)-beta-D: -glucan determination and polymerase chain reaction. The sensitivity and specificity of galactomannan antigenemia testing in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens are high in patients with hematological malignancy, neutropenia, and receipt of stem-cell transplants. False positivity can be seen with concomitant administration of some antibiotics and infection by fungi other than Aspergillus.",2008,18193305,no
Caspofungin as first-line therapy for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis after thoracic organ transplantation.,"Although amphotericin was the gold standard in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis in transplant recipients, nephrotoxicity and lack of efficacy often limits its use. Itraconazole is better tolerated but less efficacious and influences immunosuppressant trough levels significantly. We report our first clinical experience with the use of caspofungin as first-line therapy in heart and lung transplant recipients with invasive aspergillosis.Caspofungin was administered at 50 to 70 mg/day in heart and lung transplant recipients with renal impairment while invasive aspergillosis was diagnosed and classified. Aspergillus serology, serologic inflammatory markers, and X-rays were taken to monitor infectious activity. Creatinine and immunosuppressant trough levels were monitored closely.Invasive aspergillosis was diagnosed by chest X-ray, serology, and positive sputum in 1 heart-lung, 7 heart, and 4 single-lung transplant recipients, and caspofungin was administered for a mean time of 21 +/- 9 days. Basic immunosuppressants were tacrolimus in 9 patients or cyclosporine in 3. Complete remission was achieved in 10 patients (83%). Adverse effects of caspofungin were fever in 6, diarrhea in 3, and neutropenia in 1. Renal function remained stable (3.2 +/- 1 mg/dl before vs 2.3 +/- 0.9 mg/dl after, p = 0.07). Trough levels of all immunosuppressants did not change significantly during caspofungin treatment (10.9 +/- 4.1 ng/ml before vs 9.9 +/- 4.0 ng/ml after [p = 0.31] for tacrolimus 214 +/- 98 ng/ml before vs 229 +/- 88 ng/ml after [p = 0.41] for cyclosporin A), while the administered dosage remained stable.In heart and lung transplant recipients with invasive aspergillosis, caspofungin seemed to be an effective anti-fungal agent with a promising safety profile. Further prospective randomized trials are needed to investigate an advantageous role of caspofungin in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis.",2008,18187079,no
The effect of antifungal agents and human monocytes on in vitro galactomannan release by Aspergillus spp. in liquid culture medium.,"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is increasing in incidence in immunosuppressed patients. Diagnosis of this infection is problematic, relying on clinical suspicion and computerized tomography of the thorax and sinuses. An assay capable of detecting the fungal cell wall component galactomannan (GM) as a sign of Aspergillus infection is in use in patients with hematological malignancies. The aim of this study was to investigate the release of GM during growth of two medically important species, Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus terreus, in liquid medium, including interaction with fluconazole, amphotericin B, liposomal amphotericin B and itraconazole, as well as human monocytes. Our results showed that for both species, amphotericin B deoxycholate, liposomal amphotericin B and itraconazole reduced the concentrations of GM to very low levels at the lowest doses tested (1, 3 and 4 microg/L, respectively). High doses of fluconazole had negligible effect on GM release by A. terreus, as expected. However, fluconazole at 128 microg/L increased GM concentrations released by A. fumigatus without reduction in visible growth. Co-incubation with human monocytes had no significant effect on GM release. The effects of antifungal agents on GM release may have diagnostic implications.",2008,18184406,no
[Investigation of Aspergillus galactomannan levels in antimicrobial agents].,"The diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis which is a serious infection of immunocompromized patients, depends on the detection of Aspergillus galactomannan antigen in the serum by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) in routine laboratories. However, it has been previously reported that false positive results in Aspergillus galactomannan test may be obtained in the sera of patients sera receiving piperacillin-tazobactam (PIP-TAZ). The aim of this study was to investigate the presence and levels of Aspergillus galactomannan antigen in the content of PIP-TAZ and some other antimicrobial agents that are often used for the treatment of infections in immunocompromised patients. The level of galactomannan antigen was determined for PIP-TAZ, ampicillin-sulbactam, ampicillin, penicillin G, ceftriaxone, cefepime, imipenem, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ornidazole, fluconazole and amphotericin B, by a commercial EIA (Platelia Aspergillus EIA, Bio-Rad, France) kit. Galactomannan index (GI) was estimated with the ratio of absorbance values of antimicrobials to cut-off value and evaluated as positive when GI was found >0.5. Amongst the 15 antibiotics studied, the only positive result was detected for ampicillin with the highest index value (GI = 0.540), followed by PIP-TAZ with a relatively high value (GI = 0.235) even though it was not in the range of positivity. GI values have ranged from 0.011 to 0.188 for the other antibiotics. In conclusion, the use of especially ampicillin (and probably PIP-TAZ) therapy should be questioned in patients whose sera are being tested for Aspergillus galactomannan antigen by EIA in order to evaluate the positive results in terms of false positivities due to cross reactivity.",2008,18173075,no
A hybrid lesion of lung cancer and aspergillosis.,"A 74-year-old man presented with gradual wall thickening of a cystic lung lesion. Serologic tests indicated Aspergillus infection, but neither fungal organisms nor evidence of malignant disease were recovered from repeated sputum collections, a bronchoscopic lung biopsy specimen, or bronchial washings. Treatment with antifungal agents did not result in clinical improvement. Surgical resection of the lesion demonstrated both squamous cell carcinoma and aspergillosis. These distinct disorders share common radiologic manifestations that can present a diagnostic challenge, as in the present case.",2008,21892273,no
Expression of the surface antigens of lymphocytes and the levels of cytokines in mice infected with Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) is an opportunistic fungus that causes invasive aspergillosis. Determining the immune changes during A. fumigatus infection and the factors leading to such changes clearly will make it possible to prevent the spread of the infection and to provide new strategies in the treatment of infection. Thus, the present study aims at determining the changes of lymphocyte surface antigens which develop during A. fumigatus infection and the role of cytokines in immune response.The expression of the surface antigens of lymphocytes was analysed by flow cytometry and the cytokine levels were determined by ELISA in a mouse model of aspergillosis.It was observed that in mice infected by A. fumigatus the percentage of CD19+ B cells and the levels of IL-4 and IL-10 increased when compared to those in noninfected mice cells.These results suggest that Th2 type cytokines are important in the pathogenesis of A. fumigatus infection. Humoral immunity is considered to be effective during A. fumigatus infection because of the increase in Th2 type response.",2009,19736385,no

Immunoreactivity and amino acid content of fermented soybean products.,"Food allergy has become a public health problem that continues to challenge both the public and the food industry. The objective of this research was the detection and quantification of the major human allergenic soy proteins and to study the reduction in immunoreactivity and improvement of amino acid content after fermentation of soybean flour. Fermentation was carried out in the solid state of cracked seeds inoculated with Aspergillus oryzae, Rhizopus oryzae, and Bacillus subtilis and in the liquid state of milled soybean flours fermented naturally by microorganisms present only in the seeds or by inoculation with Lactobacillus plantarum. ELISA and Western blot were used to quantify IgE antibody response, and HPLC was used to identify and quantify total amino acids. L. plantarum fermented soy flour showed the highest reduction in IgE immunoreactivity (96-99%) depending upon the sensitivity of the plasma used. Among the solid fermented products, the lowest reduction in immunoreactivity was obtained when mold strains, R. oryzae and A. oryzae, were used (66 and 68%, respectively, for human plasma 97.5 kUA/L). Among the solid fermented products, those inoculated with B. subtilis yielded a 81 and 86% reduction in immunoreactivity against both human plasma 97.5 IgE kUA/L and human pooled plasma samples, respectively. When soybean was subjected to liquid fermentation, most of the total amino acids increased significantly ( p < or = 0.05). In solid fermentation with R. oryzae, only Ala and Thr content improved. Fermentation can decrease soy immunoreactivity, and there is potential of developing nutritious hypoallergenic soy products.",2007,18072744,no
"CreA-mediated repression in Aspergillus nidulans does not require transcriptional auto-regulation, regulated intracellular localisation or degradation of CreA.","The major regulatory protein in carbon repression in Aspergillus nidulans is CreA. Strains constitutively over-expressing creA show normal responses to carbon repression, indicating that auto-regulation of creA is not essential for CreA-mediated regulation. In these strains, high levels of CreA are present whether cells are grown in repressing or derepressing conditions, indicating large-scale degradation of CreA does not play a key role. CreA is located in the nucleus and cytoplasm in cells when grown in either repressing or derepressing conditions, and absence of CreB, CreD or AcrB does not affect either the localisation or amount of CreA. Therefore, CreA must require some modification or interaction to act as a repressor. Deletion analysis indicates that a region of CreA thought to be important for repression in Trichoderma reesei and Sclerotina sclerotiorum CreA homologues is not critical for function in Aspergillus nidulans.",2007,18063396,no
Degradation of raffinose oligosaccharides in soymilk by immobilized alpha-galactosidase of Aspergillus oryzae.,"Alpha-galactosidase was immobilized in a mixture of k-carrageenan and locust bean gum. The properties of the free and immobilized enzyme were then determined. The optimum pH for both the soluble and immobilized enzyme was 4.8. The optimum temperature for the soluble enzymes was 50 degrees C, whereas that for the immobilized enzyme was 55 degrees C. The immobilized enzyme was used in batch, repeated batch, and continuous modes to degrade the raffinose-family sugars present in soymilk. Two hours of incubation with the free and immobilized alpha-galactosidases resulted in an 80% and 68% reduction in the raffinose oligosaccharides in the soymilk, respectively. In the repeated batch, a 73% reduction was obtained in the fourth cycle. A fluidized bed reactor was also designed to treat soymilk continuously and the performance of the immobilized alpha-galactosidase tested at different flow rates, resulting in a 90% reduction of raffinose-family oligosaccharides in the soymilk at a flow rate 40 ml/h. Therefore, the present study demonstrated that immobilized alpha-galactosidase in a continuous mode is efficient for reducing the oligosaccharides present in soymilk, which may be of considerable interest for industrial application.",2007,18062219,no
False-positive Aspergillus galactomannan antigenaemia after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,"Although Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) antigen detection is widely applied in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA), false-positive reactions with fungus-derived antibiotics, other fungal genera or the passage of dietary GM through injured mucosa are a matter of concern. The aim of this study was to investigate the cumulative incidence and risk factors for false-positive GM antigenaemia.The records of 157 adult allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients were retrospectively analysed. Episodes of positive GM antigenaemia, defined as two consecutive GM results with an optical density index above 0.6, were classified into true, false and inconclusive GM antigenaemia by reviewing the clinical course.Twenty-five patients developed proven or probable IA with a 1 year cumulative incidence of 12.9%, whereas 50 experienced positive GM antigenaemia with an incidence of 32.2%. Among the total 58 positive episodes of the 50 patients, 29 were considered false-positive. The positive predictive value (PPV) was lower during the first 100 days than beyond 100 days after HSCT (37.5% versus 58.8%). Gastrointestinal chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was identified as the only independent significant factor for the increased incidence of false-positive GM antigenaemia (PPV 0% versus 66.7%, P = 0.02).GM antigen results must be considered cautiously in conjunction with other diagnostic procedures including computed tomography scans, especially during the first 100 days after HSCT and in patients with gastrointestinal chronic GVHD.",2007,18055488,no
Analytical bias of cross-reactive polyclonal antibodies for environmental immunoassays of Alternaria alternata.,"Alternaria alternata is recognized as an important aeroallergen indoors and outdoors, and exposure to the fungus has been identified as a risk factor for asthma. Two recent publications concluded that 95% to 99% of American homes contained detectable amounts of Alternaria antigens when analyzed with a polyclonal antibody (pAb)-based ELISA.We investigated the cross-reactivity of the commercially available pAbs that were used in those studies.Reactivity to 24 fungal species commonly found in indoor environments was analyzed by inhibition ELISA by using solid-phase A alternata antigen. The pAbs were also tested by immunoblotting and halogen immunoassay for a subgroup of fungi.Spores of 7 fungi including species of Alternaria, Ulocladium, Stemphylium, Epicoccum, Drechslera, and Exserohilum strongly inhibited the binding of the pAbs when tested by ELISA. Six other fungi reacted in the ELISA at a lower level, and 11 fungal species including several Penicillium, Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Cladosporium species failed to show inhibition. The immunoblots and the halogen immunoassay staining confirmed the cross-reactivity patterns of the ELISA.The pAbs against A alternata were found to cross-react broadly with related and nonrelated fungi. The prevalence data previously reported for A alternata should be considered to be fungal-reactive rather than A alternata-specific.",2007,18036643,no
A clinical and mycological study of onychomycosis in HIV infection.,"Onychomycosis is one of the early manifestations of HIV infection with a prevalence of 15-40%. Multiple nail involvement, isolation of both common and rare species and resistance to treatment are the characteristics of onychomycosis in HIV.To study the epidemiology, clinical manifestations of onychomycosis in HIV-infected individuals and to identify the various causative fungi microbiologically.A total of 250 HIV infected patients, diagnosed by ELISA, were screened for nail involvement of which 60 patients i.e, 40 males and 20 females, who had clinically suspected untreated fungal infection were included in this study.Of the 60 respondents, 34 (56.66%) were from the 31-40 years age group. Amongst the 40 males, there were 20 manual laborers and 14 farmers while 18 of 20 females were housewives. Toenail involvement was seen in 38 patients (63.33%), fingernail in 12 patients (20%) while 10 (16.66%) patients had involvement of both. Twenty eight (46.66%) patients gave history of some trauma, 6 (10%) had diabetes mellitus and only 1 patient (1.66%) had history of peripheral vascular disease. Nineteen (31.66%) patients had associated tinea pedis, 5 (8.33%) had tinea manuum, 10 (16.66%) had tinea corporis and 7 (11.66%) had tinea cruris. Twenty one (35%) respondents had distal and lateral superficial onychomycosis (DLSO), 5 (8.33%) had proximal subungual onychomycosis (PSO), 1 (1.66%) had superficial white onychomycosis (SWO), while 33 (55%) had total dystrophic onychomycosis (TDO). Fungal elements were demonstrated by KOH mount in 49 patients (81.66%) and growth was seen in 32 (53.33%) cultures. Dermatophytes were isolated in 13 (21.66%) and nondermatophytic molds (NDM) in 19 (31.66%). Out of the 13 positive dermatophyte cultures, Trichophyton rubrum was isolated on 11 and Trichophyton mentagrophytes on 2 cultures. Of the 19 non-dermatophytic cultures, Aspergillus niger was isolated on 3 and Candida spp. on 12 while Cladosporium spp, Scytalidium hyalinum, Penicillium spp. and Gymnoascus dankaliensis on 1 each.Total dystrophic onychomycosis was the most common clinical type and NDM were the predominant causative organisms.",2007,18032858,no
Well-characterized monoclonal antibodies against cell wall antigen of Aspergillus species improve immunoassay specificity and sensitivity.,"The diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) based on the detection of Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) is complicated by the presence of cross-reactive GM epitopes in patient specimens. We have developed a novel and specific Aspergillus antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) by the selection of two well-characterized monoclonal antibodies from 17 candidate antibodies. The epitopes recognized by the monoclonal antibodies were present on the cell walls of the hyphae and the conidia of Aspergillus species, which were circulating or excreted as immunodominant antigens during the acute phase of IA established in the animal models. The detection of experimental Aspergillus-mediated antigenemia was suitably sensitive, and the sensitivity was comparable to that of a commercial GM detection ELISA kit (the Platelia Aspergillus assay). Moreover, the specificity of this assay was 100% when it was used to test 382 serum specimens and 120 urine specimens from healthy individuals. Cross-reactivity with other common opportunistic fungi, such as Penicillium and Candida species, and with purified GM protein derived from Aspergillus was not evident. Therefore, the chemical nature of the epitopes captured in this assay is most likely not associated with the GM structure, indicating that this newly developed Aspergillus antigen-capture ELISA is a promising tool for the diagnosis of IA without the risk of the false-positive results that are problematic with current GM antigen assays.",2007,18032591,no
Whole blood and tissue fungal DNA quantification in the diagnosis of canine sino-nasal aspergillosis.,"Various combinations of tests are used to confirm the diagnosis of canine sino-nasal aspergillosis (SNA) because false-positive and false-negative results can occur with each test. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether detection of fungal DNA in blood and nasal tissue samples was of value in the clinical diagnosis of this disease. Four groups were included in the study (dogs with SNA, lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis or nasal neoplasia, and control animals). Real-time PCR assays detecting DNA from all Penicillium and Aspergillus species (PenAsp assay) or species-specific DNA from A. fumigatus, A. terreus, A. flavus and A. niger were applied to whole blood and nasal tissue samples. Results obtained by PCR were compared between the groups. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) for fungal DNA detection were compared with those for alternative diagnostic procedures including histopathology, serology and fungal culture. Significantly more fungal DNA was detected by the PenAsp assay in tissue biopsies from dogs with SNA than in the three other groups. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for this method were 1.00, 0.06, 0.32 and 1.00. A. fumigatus DNA was detected in seven tissue biopsies from dogs with SNA and in one biopsy from a dog with a nasal tumour. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for this diagnostic test were 0.50, 0.97, 0.87 and 0.82. No significant difference was found between the groups with respect to the amount of DNA detected in blood by the PenAsp assay. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for this method were 0.71, 0.24, 0.31 and 0.64. A. fumigatus DNA was detected in the blood of three dogs with SNA and sixteen dogs without SNA. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for this diagnostic tool were 0.21, 0.45, 0.15 and 0.54. Detection of A. fumigatus DNA in nasal tissue had the highest specificity, PPV and NPV but sensitivity of this method was low. Detection of fungal DNA in whole blood was of no value in the diagnosis of SNA.",2007,18023298,no
Preparation of combined extract of cell wall and cytosol antigens of Candida albicans for immunoblot analysis.,"Immunoblot analysis is not in wide use for diagnosis of invasive candidiasis, mostly because the procedure is not standardized and hence not reliable. This work describes a standardized method for C. albicans antigen extract preparation and immunochemical detection. The major improvement of the method is the preparation of combined antigen extract -- consisting of the cell wall and cytosol antigens. The fungal cells and lysis buffer were mixed at a 1:3 ratio and disintegrated by ultrasound for six cycles of one minute each. After centrifugation, cytosol antigens were obtained in the supernatant and cell wall antigens were in the precipitate. Precipitate was dissolved in lysis buffer with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and boiled at 100 degrees C for 2 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was combined with the previous one, so the extract of the combined antigens was obtained in the mixture. With those combined antigen extracts and with sera of three different groups of patients, immunoblot analysis showed sensitivity of 90.2%, specificity of 84.4%, and accuracy of 88.0%.",2007,18022925,no
Fungi and selected mycotoxins from pre- and postfermented corn silage.,"To determine fungal genera, Aspergillus and Fusarium species and aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)), zearalenone (ZEA), deoxynivalenol (DON), fumonisin B(1) (FB(1)) contamination from pre- and postfermented corn silage produced in the most important region of Argentina where silage practice is developed.Sampling of corn silos was performed manually through silos in transects at three levels: upper, middle and low sections. AFB(1) and FB(1) were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography, zearalenone by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and DON by gas chromatography. Over 90% of the samples showed counts higher than 1 x 10(4) CFU g(-1). Aspergillus flavus and Fusarium verticillioides were the prevalent species. Some tested samples were contaminated with AFB(1), ZEA, DON and FB(1).This study demonstrates the presence of fungi and AFB(1), ZEA, DON and FB(1) contamination in corn silage in Argentina.This manuscript makes a contribution to the knowledge of mycotoxins in Argentinean silage in particular because the environmental conditions in this country differ from those of most reports. The comparison of pre- and postfermentation silage is also outstanding. Therefore, information on fungi and mycotoxins present in silage--an increasingly popular commodity--is useful to estimate potential risk for animal and human health.",2007,18005347,no

[Contribution of galactomannan antigen detection to early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis].,"Invasive aspergillosis is a serious and often lethal fungal infection in immunocompromised patients, with increasing incidence in recent years. The high mortality is related not only to severe immunosuppression but especially to difficulties in early diagnosis. The development of noninvasive nonculture diagnostic methods in recent years is a major advance in the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis, but the only method with a clear position is currently galactomannan detection by sandwich ELISA. The test has an excellent negative predictive value and is able to exclude invasive aspergillosis with high probability. In addition, its good sensitivity often allows diagnosis of the condition before it is clinically manifested. However, variations in sensitivity due to numerous factors and potential false-positive results in certain populations are the main limitations to its use. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current knowledge of the use of galactomannan in the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.",2007,17987566,no
Aspergillosis in children after liver transplantation: Single center experience.,"Aspergillus infection in immunocompromised patients is associated with high morbidity and mortality. We retrospectively reviewed cases of Aspergillosis (A), in a series of 277 children who received LTx between 1990 and 2006. All children were given antifungal prophylaxis after transplantation. Aspergillosis was identified in 10 cases (3.6%) and diagnosis was confirmed when clinical symptoms were associated with identification of Aspergillus sp. or detection of galactomannan antigen. Incidence of Aspergillosis considerably decreased from 6.9% to 0.6% when liposomal amphotericin B was introduced as prophylaxis in high-risk patients. Mean time since LTx to Aspergillosis was 14.5 days. Histologically, Aspergillosis was diagnosed in two cases. Galactomannan antigen was present in two recipients. Aspergillus infection occurs usually within first 30 days after transplantation as a result of a combination of several risk factors. Following risk factors were observed: multiple antibiotic therapy, prolonged intensive care unit stay, poor graft function, retransplantation, relaparotomies, co-infection. Amphotericin B was administered in all cases. Two patients (20%) died because of Aspergillosis Liposomal Amphotericin B prophylaxis in high-risk children decreases the incidence of Aspergillus infection. High index of suspicion and early diagnosis followed by intensive treatment with amphotericin B facilitates achieving mortality rate lower than presented in other reports.",2007,17976121,no
Expression of human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor in Aspergillus niger.,"Human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha1-PI), also known as antitrypsin, is the most abundant serine protease inhibitor (serpin) in plasma. Its deficiency is associated with development of progressive, ultimately fatal emphysema. Currently in the United States, alpha1-PI is available for replacement therapy as an FDA licensed plasma-derived (pd) product. However, the plasma source itself is limited moreover, even with efficient viral inactivation steps used in manufacture of plasma products, the risk of contamination from emerging viruses may still exist. Therefore, recombinant alpha1-PI (r-alpha1-PI) could provide an attractive alternative. Although r-alpha1-PI has been produced in several hosts, protein stability in vitro and rapid clearance from the circulation have been major issues, primarily due to absent or altered glycosylation.We have explored the possibility of expressing the gene for human alpha1-PI in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger (A. niger), a system reported to be capable of providing more ""mammalian-like"" glycosylation patterns to secretable proteins than commonly used yeast hosts. Our expression strategy was based on fusion of alpha1-PI with a strongly expressed, secreted leader protein (glucoamylase G2), separated by dibasic processing site (N-V-I-S-K-R) that provides in vivo cleavage. SDS-PAGE, Western blot, ELISA, and alpha1-PI activity assays enabled us to select the transformant(s) secreting a biologically active glycosylated r-alpha1-PI with yields of up to 12 mg/L. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) analysis further confirmed that molecular mass of the r-alpha1-PI was similar to that of the pd-alpha1-PI. In vitro stability of the r-alpha1-PI from A. niger was tested in comparison with pd-alpha1-PI reference and non-glycosylated human r-alpha1-PI from E. coli.We examined the suitability of the filamentous fungus A. niger for the expression of the human gene for alpha1-PI, a medium size glycoprotein of high therapeutic value. The heterologous expression of the human gene for alpha1-PI in A. niger was successfully achieved to produce the secreted mature human r-alpha1-PI in A. niger as a biologically active glycosylated protein with improved stability and with yields of up to 12 mg/L in shake-flask growth.",2007,17967194,no
Advances in antifungal therapy.,"The prevalence of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) has increased over the past three decades owing to the increasing numbers of immunocompromised hosts. These infections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Recent significant advances in antifungal therapy include the broad-spectrum triazoles (voriconazole and posaconazole) and a new class of antifungals, the echinocandins (caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin). New treatment strategies, such as combination therapy and pre-emptive therapy, are being investigated. There have also been significant improvements in diagnostics the galactomannan enzyme immunoassay and the beta-glucan test are now part of the EORTC/MSG criteria for diagnosis of IFI. Despite these advances, there remain a number of unanswered questions regarding optimal management of serious fungal infections, and research continues to discover and develop new therapies and evaluate new management strategies.",2007,17967129,no
Prevalence of aflatoxin B1 in liver biopsies of proven hepatocellular carcinoma in India determined by an in-house immunoperoxidase test.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. The incidence of HCC in India is reportedly low and varies from 0.2 to 1.9 %. Aflatoxins, secondary metabolites produced by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus, are potent human carcinogens implicated in HCC. The prevalence of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) as co-carcinogen was analysed using an in-house immunoperoxidase test in 31 liver biopsies and 7 liver-resection specimens from histopathologically proven HCC, and in 15 liver biopsies from cirrhosis patients (control group). Serum was tested for hepatitis B and C serological markers using commercial assays, and for AFB1 using an in-house ELISA with a sensitivity of approximately 1 ng ml(-1) for AFB1. In spite of positive AFB1 immunostaining in HCC cases, all serum specimens, from both HCC and the control groups, were AFB1-negative. There were 18 (58.1 %) HCC cases that revealed AFB1 in liver biopsies 68.8 % (n=11) of non-B non-C hepatitis cases with HCC and 46.1 % (n=6) of the hepatitis B surface-antigen-positive subjects were positive for AFB1. Out of the two hepatitis B/hepatitis C virus co-infected cases, one was positive for AFB1. Of seven tumour-resection samples, six were positive for AFB1. Only one case revealed AFB1 in the non-tumour area of the resected material. Thus AFB1 staining was significantly associated with tumour tissue (P=0.03). Aflatoxins proved to have a significant association with HCC in this peninsular part of the subcontinent. The impact seems to be a cumulative process, as revealed by the AFB1 deposits in HCC liver tissue, even though the serum levels were undetectable.",2007,17965344,no
"Some fungi, zearalenone and other mycotoxins in chicken rations, stock feedstuffs, lucerne and pasture grasses in the communal farming area of Rhenosterkop in South Africa.","Mycotoxins may be present in feeds without any visible signs of mould contamination. There is a need for rapid and accurate measurement of mycotoxins for purposes of continual monitoring and identification of high risk commodities. Samples from commercial chicken feed (maize kernels), cattle feed (lucerne, grass and hay) and milk were analysed for the presence of certain mycotoxins and cultured for fungi. Results of fungal profiles showed that most samples were contaminated by moulds belonging to the genera, Alternaria, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Penicillium, Mucor, Phoma and Rhizopus. All the chicken feed samples tested contained mycotoxins either below the recommended safe levels for poultry or below the detection limits of the ELISA tests. However, samples of grass contained levels of zearalenone greater than the allowable concentration for dairy and beef cattle (250 ppm), which may be linked to the presence of Fusarium scirpi identified in the fungal profiles. The levels of AFMI were below the detection limits of the ELISA tests, which may be attributed to the low levels of aflatoxins found in the feed (grass) samples. The presence of the fungus in samples analysed is not evidence for the presence of mycotoxins.",2007,17941598,no
Transgenic maize plants expressing a fungal phytase gene.,"Maize seeds are the major ingredient of commercial pig and poultry feed. Phosphorus in maize seeds exists predominantly in the form of phytate. Phytate phosphorus is not available to monogastric animals and phosphate supplementation is required for optimal animal growth. Undigested phytate in animal manure is considered a major source of phosphorus pollution to the environment from agricultural production. Microbial phytase produced by fermentation as a feed additive is widely used to manage the nutritional and environmental problems caused by phytate, but the approach is associated with production costs for the enzyme and requirement of special cares in feed processing and diet formulation. An alternative approach would be to produce plant seeds that contain high phytase activities. We have over-expressed Aspergillus niger phyA2 gene in maize seeds using a construct driven by the maize embryo-specific globulin-1 promoter. Low-copy-number transgenic lines with simple integration patterns were identified. Western-blot analysis showed that the maize-expressed phytase protein was smaller than that expressed in yeast, apparently due to different glycosylation. Phytase activity in transgenic maize seeds reached approximately 2,200 units per kg seed, about a 50-fold increase compared to non-transgenic maize seeds. The phytase expression was stable across four generations. The transgenic seeds germinated normally. Our results show that the phytase expression lines can be used for development of new maize hybrids to improve phosphorus availability and reduce the impact of animal production on the environment.",2007,17932782,no
The initiation and pattern of spread of histone H4 acetylation parallel the order of transcriptional activation of genes in the aflatoxin cluster.,"The 27 genes involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis are clustered within a 70 kb region in the Aspergillus parasiticus genome. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated a positive correlation between the initiation and spread of histone H4 acetylation in aflatoxin promoters and the onset of accumulation of aflatoxin proteins and aflatoxin. Histone H4 acetylation in the pksA (encodes an 'early' biosynthetic pathway enzyme) promoter peaked at 30 h, prior to the increased acetylation in the omtA and ordA (encode 'late' enzymes) promoters detected at 40 h. The specific order in which pksA, ver-1 (encodes a 'middle' enzyme) and omtA transcripts accumulated in cells paralleled the pattern of spread of histone H4 acetylation. Binding of AflR, a positive regulator of aflatoxin biosynthesis, to the ordA promoter showed a positive correlation with the spread of histone H4 acetylation. The data suggest that the order of genes within the aflatoxin cluster determines the timing and order of transcriptional activation, and that the site of initiation and spread of histone H4 acetylation mediate this process. Our data indicate that the aflatoxin and adjacent sugar utilization clusters are part of a larger 'regulatory unit'.",2007,17919289,no
Detection of histoplasma antigen by a quantitative enzyme immunoassay.,"The second-generation Histoplasma antigen immunoassay is semiquantitative, expressing results as a comparison to a negative control, which requires repeat testing of the prior specimen with the current specimen to accurately determine a change in antigen. Reporting results in this manner often is confusing to the ordering physician and laboratory. Development of a quantitative assay could improve accuracy, reduce interassay variability, and eliminate the need to test the prior sample with the current sample in the same assay. Calibrators with known concentrations of Histoplasma antigen were used to quantitate antigen in specimens from patients with histoplasmosis and from controls. Samples from cases of disseminated histoplasmosis or other mycoses and controls were tested to evaluate the performance characteristics of the quantitative assay. Paired specimens were evaluated to determine if quantitation eliminated the need to test the current and prior specimens in the same assay to assess a change in antigen. The sensitivity in samples from patients with AIDS and disseminated histoplasmosis was 100% in urine and 92.3% in serum. Cross-reactions occurred in 70% of other endemic mycoses, but not in aspergillosis. Specificity was 99% in controls with community-acquired pneumonia, medical conditions in which histoplasmosis was excluded, or healthy subjects. A change in antigen level categorized as an increase, no change, or decrease based on antigen units determined in the same assay agreed closely with the category of change in nanograms/milliliter determined from testing current and prior specimens in different assays. Sensitivity, specificity, and interassay precision are excellent in the new third-generation quantitative Histoplasma antigen immunoassay.",2007,17913863,no
Negative impact of Aspergillus galactomannan and DNA detection in the diagnosis of fungal rhinosinusitis.,"A proportion of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, especially if nasal polyps are present, have a diagnosis of fungal rhinosinusitis. The diagnosis is difficult to establish because the symptoms and clinical and radiological signs are non-specific. Also current diagnostic methods, i.e. histology, fungal staining and culture, are insensitive. The performance of the Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) ELISA and real-time PCR for Aspergillus fumigatus mitochondrial DNA was evaluated for the detection of Aspergillus in sinus mucus samples from 25 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. The results were compared with those from nasal lavage fluid from 19 healthy volunteers. Seven patients (28 %) were diagnosed as having fungal rhinosinusitis according to the presence of filaments in histology or direct microscopy using Calcofluor white. All fungal rhinosinusitis patients were negative in the GM ELISA. GM ELISA was positive in five patients whose samples were negative using conventional methods and A. fumigatus PCR. Two out of seven patients with fungal rhinosinusitis were positive by A. fumigatus PCR: one also had a positive A. fumigatus culture, and one had hyphae consistent with Aspergillus in histology. One additional patient had a weak positive PCR result, but other fungal tests were negative. In control subjects, the GM ELISA was positive in 21 %, whereas direct microscopy, culture and A. fumigatus PCR were negative in all samples. Direct microscopy and culture together with histology remain pivotal in defining fungal rhinosinusitis diagnosis. A. fumigatus PCR may have additional value in allowing the diagnosis to be made sooner, whereas the GM ELISA is not reliable in diagnosing Aspergillus infection of the paranasal sinuses.",2007,17893168,no
False-positive Aspergillus antigen testing due to application of piperacillin/tazobactam--is it still an issue?,"We evaluated the impact of piperacillin/tazobactam (PT) therapy on galactomannan enzyme immunoassay (GEI) testing (Platelia Bio-Rad, Marnes La Coquette, France). Galactomannan contents of PT batches were highly variable. We found that false-positive GEI results can be avoided by performance of blood sampling before PT administration and by using separate sites for blood sampling and for administration of antibiotics.",2007,17889483,no
Galactomannan in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid: a tool for diagnosing aspergillosis in intensive care unit patients.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is an important cause of mortality in patients with hematologic malignancies. However, IA appears to be gaining a foothold in the intensive care unit (ICU) in patients without classical risk factors. A recent study described 89 cases of IA in patients in a medical ICU without leukemia or cancer. The diagnosis of IA remains difficult and is often established too late. Galactomannan (GM) is an exo-antigen released from Aspergillus hyphae while they invade host tissue.This prospective single-center study was conducted to investigate the role of GM in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid as a tool for early diagnosis of IA in the ICU.All patients with risk factors identified in our earlier study were evaluated. BAL for culture and GM detection, serum GM levels, and computed tomography scan were obtained for all included patients with signs of pneumonia. Patients were classified as having proven, probable, or possible IA.A total of 110 patients out of 1,109 admissions were eligible. There were 26 proven IA cases. Using a cutoff index of 0.5, the sensitivity and specificity of GM detection in BAL fluid was 88 and 87%, respectively. The sensitivity of serum GM was only 42%. In 11 of 26 proven cases, BAL culture and serum GM remained negative, whereas GM in BAL was positive.IA is common in immunocompromised, critically ill patients. GM detection in BAL fluid seems to be useful in establishing or excluding the diagnosis of IA in the ICU.",2007,17885264,no
[Imaging of thoracic pathology in patients with AIDS].,"The imaging features of infectious and non-infectious pathologies in HIV patients with AIDS (less than 200 CD4/mm3) are illustrated. Opportunistic infections, tumors and vascular pathologies have variable appearances based on the degree of immunosuppression and patient compliance with opportunistic infection prophylaxis.

Transcriptional control of nmrA by the bZIP transcription factor MeaB reveals a new level of nitrogen regulation in Aspergillus nidulans.,"Fungi can use a diverse range of nitrogen sources. Some nitrogen sources sustain a rapid growth rate and are used in preference to less readily metabolized nitrogen sources. The mechanisms involved in this control of nitrogen utilization have been studied in the model filamentous ascomycete, Aspergillus nidulans. The GATA transcription factor AreA is necessary for the expression of nitrogen-catabolic permeases and enzymes. AreA activity is controlled by multiple mechanisms including regulated areA transcript levels and regulated AreA nuclear export. During nitrogen sufficiency, AreA activation is also prevented by the co-repressor NmrA. We have investigated nitrogen signalling to NmrA. NmrA overexpression prevents AreA function irrespective of the nitrogen status. The mRNA levels of areA and nmrA are inversely regulated, suggesting that the relative levels of AreA and NmrA are critical in determining AreA activation. The bZIP transcription factor MeaB was found to activate nmrA expression and a conserved element, TTGCACCAT, bound by MeaB in vitro is present in the promoters of NmrA homologues in other filamentous ascomycetes. Expression of meaB was not strongly regulated suggesting that transcriptional activation by MeaB is modulated by the nitrogen status. This work highlights a new level of complexity in the regulation of nitrogen catabolism.",2007,17854403,no
The value of computed tomography-guided percutaneous lung biopsy for diagnosis of invasive fungal infection in immunocompromised patients.,"We assessed Calcofluor white staining, Aspergillus polymerase chain reaction, and a galactomannan enzyme immunoassay for diagnosis of fungal infection with use of computed tomography-guided percutaneous lung biopsy specimens obtained from 61 patients.

Baseline mannose binding lectin levels may not predict infection among children with leukemia.,"We measured baseline serum mannose binding lectin (MBL) levels in 91 patients with childhood leukemia to determine their predictive value for the development of febrile neutropenia or specific infections. Median MBL levels did not differ significantly between patients who developed febrile neutropenia, bacterial infection, or disseminated fungal infection and those who did not. In addition, low MBL levels were not associated with an increased cumulative incidence of infection or with a shorter time to first infection. This preliminary study suggests that baseline MBL levels may not be clinically useful to identify pediatric leukemia patients who are at increased risk of infection. Additional studies are required to determine whether serial MBL measurements may be valuable for this purpose.",2007,17729243,no

Creation and characterization of an IgG1-type monoclonal antibody against intact Aspergillus fumigatus conidia.,"The inability to accurately mimic and track the natural mechanisms of sensitization, challenge, and clearance in experimental models of allergic asthma restricts the ability to identify potential therapeutic targets and elucidate basic biological mechanisms of this prominent human disease. Use of a clinically relevant fungal allergen, such as Aspergillus fumigatus, allows researchers to follow an allergen's uptake and clearance from the lung. Unfortunately, there are currently limited resources to specifically visualize or sensitively quantify a small number of fungal conidia in the lung. In this study, we have created and characterized an IgG1 isotype monoclonal antibody produced against the intact conidia of A. fumigatus for the purpose of developing specific detection and quantification techniques.",2007,17725387,no
Indirect enzyme-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for quantification of TAXI and XIP type xylanase inhibitors in wheat and other cereals.,"To quantify Triticum aestivum xylanase inhibitor (TAXI) and xylanase inhibiting protein (XIP) type proteins in cereals in general and wheat ( T. aestivum) in particular, a robust enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using an uncommon enzyme-antibody sandwich format was developed. Bacillus subtilis glycoside hydrolase family (GH) 11 and Aspergillus oryzae GH 10 xylanases were selected for coating ELISA plate wells to capture TAXI and XIP, respectively, prior to probing with antibodies. The detection threshold of the developed ELISA was much lower than that of the currently used xylanase inhibitor assay and the recently described Western blot approach. Because of its broad dynamic range (TAXI, 30-600 ng/mL, and XIP, 3-60 ng/mL), one proper standard extract dilution can be used for analyzing different wheat varieties, whereas for the currently used colorimetric assay, often different dilutions need to be analyzed.

Infectious uveitis in immunocompromised patients and the diagnostic value of polymerase chain reaction and Goldmann-Witmer coefficient in aqueous analysis.,"To establish the causes of uveitis in immunocompromised patients and to determine the contribution of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Goldmann-Witmer coefficient (GWC) analysis of aqueous humor in patients with an infectious etiology.Retrospective case series of 56 consecutive immunocompromised patients with uveitis.All patients underwent full ophthalmologic examination and laboratory blood analysis for uveitis. Aqueous humor analyses were performed using PCR and GWC for cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), and Toxoplasma gondii.Of 56 immunocompromised patients, 43 (77%), all posterior and panuveitis, had intraocular infections. Twenty-one (49%) had CMV, three (7%) had VZV, 11 (26%) had T. gondii, six (14%) had Treponema pallidum, and one (2%) each had Aspergillus and Candida. In AIDS patients, CMV was the most common cause. A strong correlation between AIDS and ocular syphilis was also observed (P = .007). In nonAIDS immunocompromised patients, T. gondii was most frequently detected. Twenty-seven patients were examined by both PCR and GWC five (18.5%) were positive by both assays, 15 (55.5%) were positive by PCR alone and seven (26%) by GWC alone.

The Aspergillus nidulans cetA and calA genes are involved in conidial germination and cell wall morphogenesis.,"The Aspergillus nidulans genes cetA (AN3079.2) and calA (AN7619.2) encode a novel class of fungal thaumatin-like proteins of unknown function. Deletion of cetA does not result in an observable phenotype [Greenstein, S., Shadkchan, Y., Jadoun, J., Sharon, C., Markovich, S., Osherov, N., 2006. Analysis of the Aspergillus nidulans thaumatin-like cetA gene and evidence for transcriptional repression of pyr4 expression in the cetA-disrupted strain. Fungal Genet. Biol. 43, 42-53]. We prepared knockout calA and calA/cetA A. nidulans strains. The calA mutants were phenotypically identical to the wild-type. In contrast, the cetA/calA double mutant showed a synthetic lethal phenotype suggesting that the two genes affect a single function or pathway: most of its conidia were completely inhibited in germination. Many collapsed and underwent lysis. A few showed abnormal germination characterized by short swollen hyphae and abnormal hyphal branching. Nongerminated conidia contained a single condensed nucleus suggesting a block in early germination. This is the first functional analysis of the novel cetA/calA family of thaumatin-like genes and their role in A. nidulans conidial germination. We show that CETA and CALA are secreted proteins that together play an essential role in early conidial germination.",2007,17703972,no
"Current status of fungal cell wall components in the immunodiagnostics of invasive fungal infections in humans: galactomannan, mannan and (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan antigens.","Early diagnosis of fungal infections and the implementation of appropriate treatment represent major issues for clinicians, nowadays. Histopathological demonstration of microorganisms in tissue specimens or growth of fungal agents in culture media is still considered the ""gold standard"", but obtaining such specimens may be difficult. Several groups have investigated serological assays for cell wall elements unique to fungal organisms in serum or other body fluids to improve diagnostics in patients with haematological malignancies or undergoing haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. In this review we have concentrated on the currently available assays allowing for detection of highly immunogenic components of fungal cell wall: galactomannan, mannan, and also (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan. Rapid serological tests appear to be useful for screening high-risk haematological patients, since they allow for the early diagnosis of invasive fungal infections, including infections with the most common pathogens such as Aspergillus and Candida. Based on current literature, factors increasing the probability of obtaining false-positive or false-negative results detected by each test were also analysed and tabulated.",2007,17671803,no

Prevalence of Aspergillosis in chronic lung diseases.,"Eighty eight patients of chronic lung diseases (CLD) attending TB and Chest department of J.N. Medical college Hospital were studied to find out the prevalence of Aspergillus in Broncho-alveolar Lavage (BAL) and anti- aspergillus antibodies in their sera. Direct microscopy and fungal culture of BAL was done. Antibodies were studied by immunodiffusion (ID) and Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Dot blot assay for anti-aspergillus antibodies was also performed in sera of patients which were either positive by ID or by ELISA. Aspergillus was isolated in culture from 13(14.7%) cases of CLD, while, 30.6% cases showed anti-aspergillus antibodies by serological methods. Aspergillus fumigatus was the predominant species isolated. 17(19.3%) cases of CLD showed antibody against Aspergillus by ID, 22(25%) by ELISA, while 19 of 27 seropositive cases also showed positive results by Dot Blot assay. In cases of bronchogenic carcinoma and pulmonary tuberculosis, anti-aspergillus antibodies were detected equally by ID and ELISA in 21.42% and 21.05% cases respectively. In bronchial asthma, the antibodies could be detected in 60% cases by ELISA, while, in only 10% cases by ID. ELISA was found more sensitive than ID for detection of anti-aspergillus antibodies. The sensitivity of Dot Blot lies some what between ID and ELISA. It is concluded that prevalence of Aspergillosis is quite high in chronic lung diseases, culture and serological test should be performed in conjunction and more than one type of serological tests should be performed to establish the diagnosis.",2007,17664833,no

"Invasive aspergillosis: epidemiology, diagnosis and management in immunocompromised patients.","Morbidity and mortality caused by invasive Aspergillus infections are increasing. This is because of the higher number of patients with malignancies treated with intensive immunosuppressive therapy regimens as well as their improved survival from formerly fatal bacterial infections, and the rising number of patients undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell or organ transplantation. Early initiation of effective systemic antifungal treatment is essential for a successful clinical outcome in these patients however, clinical clues for diagnosis are sparse and early microbiological proof of invasive aspergillosis (IA) is rare. Clinical diagnosis is based on pulmonary CT scan findings and non-culture based diagnostic techniques such as galactomannan or DNA detection in blood or bronchoalveolar lavage samples. Most promising outcomes can be expected in patients at high risk for aspergillosis in whom antifungal treatment has been started pre-emptively, backed up by laboratory and imaging findings. The gold standard of systemic antifungal treatment is voriconazole, which has been proven to be significantly superior to conventional amphotericin B and has led to a profound improvement of survival rates in patients with cerebral aspergillosis. Liposomal amphotericin B at standard dosages appears to be a suitable alternative for primary treatment, while caspofungin, amphotericin B lipid complex or posaconazole have shown partial or complete response in patients who had been refractory to or intolerant of primary antifungal therapy. Combination therapy with two antifungal compounds may be a promising future strategy for first-line treatment. Lung resection helps to prevent fatal haemorrhage in single patients with pulmonary lesions located in close proximity to larger blood vessels, but is primarily considered for reducing the risk of relapse during subsequent periods of severe immunosuppression. Strict reverse isolation appears to reduce the incidence of aspergillosis in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients and patients with acute myeloid leukaemia undergoing aggressive anticancer therapy. Well designed, prospective randomised studies on infection control measures effective to prevent aspergillosis are lacking. Prophylactic systemic antifungal treatment with posaconazole significantly improves survival and reduces IA in acute myeloid leukaemia patients and reduces aspergillosis incidence rates in patients with intermediate-to-severe graft-versus-host reaction emerging after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Voriconazole prophylaxis may be suitable for prevention of IA as well",2007,17661528,no
Mycological and serological study of pulmonary aspergillosis in central India.,"To study the prevalence and predisposing factors of Aspergillus infection and correlate microscopic, culture and serological findings along with drug sensitivity.Sputum samples from 123 patients of pulmonary disease with clinical suspicion of having fungal, especially Aspergillus infections, were examined microscopically and for culture. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of itraconazole was tested against the isolates. Serum samples from these patients were tested for precipitin against Aspergillus antigen using immunodiffusion (ID) technique.Aspergillus species were isolated in 20 (16.26%) cases and Aspergillus fumigatus was the predominant species isolated in 16 (80%) cases. Precipitins were detected in 29 (23.58%) cases. Serum samples collected from 50 healthy individuals to serve as controls showed no precipitin against Aspergillus antigen galactomannan. This fungus was found to be sensitive to itraconazole with MIC range 0.125-1microg/mL.Serological tests have an edge over routine smear and culture methods for the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis. Itraconazole is more effective than amphotericin B and fluconazole in the treatment of aspergillosis.",2007,17657053,no
Assessing the antifungal activity of a new oral lipid-based amphotericin B formulation following administration to rats infected with Aspergillus fumigatus.,"The purpose of this study was to assess the antifungal activity of a new oral amphotericin B (AmpB) lipid-based formulation following administration to rats infected with Aspergillus fumigatus. Aspergillus fumigatus inoculum (2.1-2.5 x 10(7) colony forming units [CFU]) were injected via the jugular vein 48h later male albino Sprague-Dawley rats (350-400 g) were administered either a single oral dose of AmpB incorporated into Peceol (50 mg AmpB/kg), physiologic saline (nontreated controls) or Peceol alone (vehicle control) once daily for 4 days. To assess antifungal activity Brain, Lung, Heart, Liver, Spleen and Kidney sections were homogenized with normal saline (1 mL/g of tissue) and a 0.1-mL aliquot was spread plated onto a Sabourand dextrose agar plate. The plates were incubated for 48 hr at 37 degrees C, at which time the number of fungal CFU were determined and corrected for tissue weight. In addition, plasma galactomannan antigen concentrations were determined. Data was reported as mean +/- standard error of the mean. The AmpB-Peceol oral formulation significantly decreased total fungal CFU concentrations recovered in all the organs added together, brain CFU concentrations, spleen CFU concentrations and plasma galactomannan antigen concentrations compared to baseline. No significant differences in lung, heart, liver and kidney CFU concentrations between treatment and control groups were observed. Peceol vehicle control did not exhibit any antifungal activity. These findings suggest that a new oral lipid-based formulation of AmpB incorporated into Peceol can significantly decrease brain and spleen CFU concentrations and plasma galactomannan antigen concentrations compared to non-treated controls.",2007,17654018,no
Identification of novel allergens of Aspergillus fumigatus using immunoproteomics approach.,"Approximately 20% of the world's asthmatics are suffering from Aspergillus fumigatus (Afu)-induced allergies. The characterization of specific IgE-inducing allergens in allergic aspergillosis patients is fundamental for clinical diagnosis and for immunotherapy.Immunoproteomics combined with mass spectrometric analysis was used to identify proteins of third-week culture filtrate (3wcf) potentially responsible for Afu-specific IgE immunoreactivity, using pooled sera from Afu-sensitized asthmatics. Their allergenic potential was also tested against patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), by two-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis immunoblotting of 3wcf proteins with individual sera from such patients. This helped us to establish a set of candidate allergens, which could be explored further for diagnostic application in allergic aspergillosis asthmatics including ABPA.Peptide mass fingerprint using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and/or de novo sequencing by MS/MS analysis of the protein spots from 2-D gels led to the identification of a total of 16 allergens of Afu. Eleven of them are being reported as allergens for the first time and five had been reported earlier. Putative isoforms of the proteins Asp f 13 and chitosanase have been observed for the first time. When studied for reactivity of these proteins among patients with ABPA using their individual sera, these patients exhibited sensitization although the pattern was varying. Taken together, these proteins could thus be considered as potential allergens even among patients with ABPA. Three of these proteins viz. the hypothetical protein (# spot no. 5), extracellular arabinase (# spot no. 6) and chitosanase (# spot no. 11) could be major allergens with specific IgE immunoreactivity with six out of eight patients' sera.The immunoproteomic approach applied to the analysis of culture filtrate proteins resulted in the identification of several candidate allergens, many of them novel, contributing to the catalogue of Afu allergenic proteins, which would facilitate improved serodiagnosis for allergic aspergillosis. In addition, the immunoreactivity of these proteins observed among the patients with ABPA may be potentially useful for its serodiagnosis and opens up further opportunities for the development of personalized immunotherapeutics for patients with ABPA.",2007,17651155,no
[The value of serum galactomannan detection for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients].,"To evaluate the value of serum galactomannan (GM) detection for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.The serum GM concentration in 167 sera from 46 patients was detected by Platelia Aspergillus double-sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (PADSELISA). According to the diagnostic criteria of invasive fungal infections in China, the diagnostic changes were evaluated, the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were calculated.The sensitivity and specificity of the PADSELISA were 81.8% and 93.3% and the positive and negative predictive values were 90.0% and 87.5% respectively. There were 15 positive cases, and 31 negative cases, and the probable IA cases were increased from 11 to 19 after the GM detection. Moreover, the serous level of galactomannan was correlated with the prognosis of the IA.The PADSELISA for GM detection is a reliable method for early diagnosis and treatment of IA in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.",2007,17650666,no
Management of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in non-neutropenic critically ill patients.,"During recent years, a rising incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in non-neutropenic critically ill patients has been reported. Critically ill patients are prone to develop disturbances in immunoregulation during their stay in the ICU, which render them more vulnerable for fungal infections. Risk factors such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), prolonged use of steroids, advanced liver disease, chronic renal replacement therapy, near-drowning and diabetes mellitus have been described. Diagnosis of IPA may be difficult and obtaining histo- or cytopathological demonstration of the fungus in order to meet the gold standard for IPA is not always feasible in these patients. Laboratory markers used as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, such as the galactomannan antigen test (GM), 1,3-beta-glucan, and Aspergillus PCR, show varying results. Antifungal therapy might be considered in patients with persistent pulmonary infection who exhibit risk factors together with positive cultures or sequentially positive GM and Aspergillus PCR in serum, in whom voriconazole is the drug of choice. The benefit of combination antifungal therapy lacks sufficient evidence so far, but this treatment might be considered in patients with breakthrough infections or refractory disease.",2007,17646966,no
Clinical significance of hyperattenuating mucoid impaction in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis: an analysis of 155 patients.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a disease that presents with diverse clinicoradiologic manifestations. High-attenuation mucus (HAM) is a characteristic radiologic finding seen in patients with ABPA however, the clinical significance of the entity remains unknown.To describe the outcome of patients with ABPA who were demonstrated to have HAM, and compare with the outcome of patients without HAM.All consecutive patients with asthma presenting to the Chest Clinic of this institute over a 4-year period were screened with an Aspergillus skin test. Patients with positive findings were further investigated, and the diagnosis of ABPA was confirmed based on predefined criteria. The patients were further classified into two groups based on the presence of HAM on HRCT scan.During the study period, 755 patients were screened for ABPA using the Aspergillus skin test 291 patients (38.5%) had positive findings, and ABPA was diagnosed in 155 patients (mean age, 33.98 yearsHAM impaction in ABPA is associated with initial serologic severity and frequent relapses but does not seem to influence complete remission.",2007,17646221,no
AIDS-related opportunistic mycoses seen in a tertiary care hospital in North India.,"Sixty symptomatic confirmed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive adult patients, of both sexes, suspected of having a fungal infection were taken as a study population, and the clinicomycological profile was correlated with the immunological status of the patients with particular reference to CD4 counts. Relevant samples were collected and subjected to direct microscopy, fungal culture and serology. CD4 counts were determined by flow cytometry. Patients belonged to the age group of 17-65 years, with a male : female ratio of 4.8 : 1. Heterosexuality was the commonest mode of transmission. Candidiasis was the most common diagnosis (41.7 %), followed by cryptococcosis (10.0 %), and pneumocystinosis and aspergillosis (8.3 % each). Two cases of histoplasmosis were also diagnosed. A low mean CD4 count of <200 cells microl(-1) was seen with most fungal infections. A total of 73 % of patients belonged to World Health Organization (WHO) stage 4, while 23.33 % belonged to stage 3. Thirty one patients (51.67 %) belonged to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stage C3. Various fungal infections correlated well with the mean CD4 counts. It was difficult to correlate statistically WHO and CDC staging because of the small sample size. However, it was possible to assess to a limited extent the possibility of using clinical diagnosis to predict the status of progression of HIV infection in a resource-poor outpatient setting.",2007,17644719,no
Role of Glycoproteins Isolated from Epicoccum purpurascens in Host-Pathogen Interaction.,"Attachment to host matrix is an important provisory step for the institution of any fungal infection. The present study investigates the role of glycoproteins of Epicoccum purpurascens in host-fungal adherence.Epicoccum spore-mycelial extract was fractionated on a concanavalin A-Sepharose column. Three glycoproteins of 12, 17 and 33 kDa (Epi p 1) were electroeluted and checked for hemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition. The monosaccharide content of the highly potent protein Epi p 1 was determined by high-performance anion exchange chromatography and pulsed amperometric detection. The interaction of Epi p 1 with mannose-binding lectin (MBL) leading to the activation of the complement system was studied by immunoblot, ELISA and ELISA inhibition techniques. Immunoblot and immunoblot inhibition were carried out with culture filtrate to determine the nature of Epi p 1.33 (Epi p 1)-, 17- and 12-kDa proteins were 58, 46 and 38 times more potent than crude extract in hemagglutination activity (HA). The HA of Epi p 1 was inhibited by N-acetyl glucosamine, glucose and laminin. Epi p 1 had a high mannose content, showed MBL binding in ion-dependent manner and caused complement activation. The protein was detected in culture filtrate and thus seems to play a significant role in fungal invasion.Epi p 1, an allergenic glycoprotein of E. purpurascens, is involved in host-fungal interactions through MBL.",2007,17643064,no
Implication of dipeptidylpeptidase IV activity in human bronchial inflammation and in bronchoconstriction evaluated in anesthetized rabbits.,"Decreased dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPPIV) activity within the human nasal mucosa has previously been shown to contribute to the severity of chronic inflammatory rhinosinusitis.To investigate and correlate the role of DPPIV activity with regard to bronchial inflammation.DPPIV/CD26 activity/concentration was investigated in the bronchial tissue of human subjects suffering from chronic bronchial inflammation. In addition, the effect of a recombinant Aspergillus fumigatus DPPIV (fuDPPIV) was investigated on histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in anesthetized rabbits.DPPIV/CD26 was present in submucosal seromucous glands, in leukocytes and to a very low degree in endothelial cells of human bronchi. DPPIV activity was correlated with tissue CD26 content measured by immunoassay. As previously reported for the nasal mucosa, DPPIV/CD26 activity was inversely correlated with the degree of airway inflammation. Systemic pretreatment with recombinant fuDPPIV markedly reduced the increase in histamine-induced airway resistance in rabbits. In conclusion, DPPIV activity modulates lower airway tone by degrading unknown peptidic substrates released by histamine in response to an allergen. Contrasting with our observations in the nose, this modulation is apparently not mediated via a neurokinin (NK1) receptor.",2007,17637510,no
Metronidazole-flavonoid derivatives as anti-Helicobacter pylori agents with potent inhibitory activity against HPE-induced interleukin-8 production by AGS cells.,"Three series of metronidazole-flavonoid derivatives were generated and evaluated for antimicrobial activity against H. pylori. Among these compounds, high anti-H. pylori activities were observed in isoflavones derivatives 4-7, 19, and 20 but exhibited no inhibitory activity against other sorts of bacteria and fungi, for example, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescence, and Aspergillus niger. Genistein derivative 6 with the potent activity (MIC=0.39 microg mL(-1)) was >50-fold more than metronidazole, and comparable to the positive control amoxicillin. Additionally, compound 6 can significantly attenuate the increase in interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels in the AGS cells stimulated by H. pylori water extract (HPE) at concentrations of 15, 30, and 60 micromol L(-1), which did not show any effects on the cell viability.",2007,17628869,no
A comparison of galactomannan-ELISA and a newly developed galactomannan-LATEX test in the serologic diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in patients with hematologic malignancies.,"We compared the sensitivity and specificity of galactomannan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (GM-ELISA) with that of a newly developed version of the commercially available latex agglutination test (GM-LATEX) in our patient population. Serum samples were collected from 144 healthy adult donors (controls) another 17 consecutive hematologic malignancy (HM) patients with probable or proven invasive aspergillosis (IA) were tested. Clinical, microbiological, and pathological data were obtained. The sensitivity of the GM-LATEX test was 53% per patient and 66% per sample and that of the GM-ELISA test was 41% per patient and 21% per sample. Both tests demonstrated a specificity of 99%. The GM-LATEX test demonstrated a superior sensitivity in terms of detecting galactomannan and thus may be useful in the diagnosis of IA in patients with HM.",2007,17623114,no
Fungal allergens induce cathelicidin LL-37 expression in chronic rhinosinusitis patients in a nasal explant model.,"Fungus is thought to play an important role in some subgroups of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) patients with eosinophilic mucus (EMCRS). The cathelicidin LL-37 is an important innate defense peptide with antimicrobial activity but its responses in CRS and EMCRS patients have not been established. We investigated the innate immune responses of LL-37 in nasal tissue from CRS and EMCRS patients to fungal allergen challenge.The levels of LL-37 produced by nasal tissue and secreted in response to fungal allergen challenge were determined by a nasal tissue explant in vitro model. LL-37 mRNA and protein levels were quantified by real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunoassay methods.LL-37 mRNA expression in CRS, but not EMCRS patients, is significantly upregulated by Aspergillus (mean fourfold increase) and Alternaria (mean sixfold increase) extracts in a dose-response manner (p < 0.001). LL-37 peptide levels in the nasal tissue from CRS patients are increased in response to Alternaria (p < 0.05). In contrast, with EMCRS patients, the expression of LL-37 peptide in nasal tissue is increased with Aspergillus (p < 0.001) but is reduced with Alternaria. We also observed a trend where levels of secreted LL-37 were decreased with higher doses of Alternaria and Aspergillus extracts.LL-37 is significantly up-regulated at the mRNA and protein level in CRS patients in response to fungal allergens. However, EMCRS patients do not show increased LL-37 at either the mRNA or the protein level in response to Alternaria.",2007,17621825,no
Invasive fungal infection in renal transplant recipients demonstrated by panfungal polymerase chain reaction.,"Invasive fungal infections following renal transplant are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. This study reports our experience using molecular assay to diagnose invasive fungal infections in renal graft recipients.One hundred twenty patients who had undergone renal transplant at the Organ Transplant Unit of Nemazi Hospital in Shiraz, Iran, between September 2004 and January 2006 were followed up for fungal infections for 6 months following transplant. Blood samples were cultured by bedside inoculation to BACTEC fungal medium. Whole blood specimens were collected prospectively once per week and were evaluated for any invasive fungal infections using panfungal polymerase chain reaction and polymerase chain reaction-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The female-to-male ratio was 44.2% to 55.8%, the mean age of the recipients was 34.7 years, and the mean length of hospitalization was 10.92 days.The sensitivity and specificity for proven and probable infections were 80% and 95.6%, respectively. Using panfungal polymerase chain reaction- enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, 4 recipients were diagnosed as having invasive fungal infections. The etiologic agents were C. albicans in 3 patients, and C. albicans and A. fumigatus in 1 patient. The mean interval of polymerase chain reaction-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay positivity in blood samples before clinical signs was 27 days (range, 7-60 days).Polymerase chain reaction-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay may improve early diagnosis of invasive fungal infections however, correlating the results of polymerase chain reaction-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with clinical outcomes in renal transplant recipients will require further evaluation.",2007,17617057,no
Serum Aspergillus galactomannan antigen values strongly correlate with outcome of invasive aspergillosis: a study of 56 patients with hematologic cancer.,"Determining the outcome of patients with aspergillosis can be particularly difficult because patients with aspergillosis are at risk for other conditions that mimic this infection. Galactomannan is an Aspergillus-specific antigen released during invasive aspergillosis and is detected by the quantitative serum galactomannan index (GMI) test.Using a kappa correlation coefficient test (KCC), the strength of correlation was determined between GMI and survival outcome of aspergillosis among 56 adults with hematologic cancer (90% had myeloma) who underwent serial GMI monitoring until hospital discharge or death.All 56 patients received antineoplastic therapy (myeloablative followed by stem cell transplantation [autologous in 21 patients and allogeneic in 3 patients] or nonmyeloablative therapy [32 patients]). The overall correlation between survival outcome and GMI was excellent (KCC = 0.8609 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.7093-1.000 [P < .0001]) and was comparable among neutropenic and nonneutropenic patients (KCC = 0.8271The survival outcome of patients with aspergillosis strongly correlated with serum GMI. These findings have important implications for patient care and clinical trials of mold-active antifungal agents.",2007,17607669,no
Invasive fungal disease in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients: an autopsy-driven survey.,"Invasive mycoses are pre-eminent causes of morbidity and mortality in the allogeneic stem cell transplant setting. In spite of novel diagnostic modalities, the timely and specific identification of invasive mycoses still remains challenging. We analyzed the case history of 97 consecutive patients receiving 103 allogeneic stem cell transplants between January 2003 and October 2006 performed by a single team at 2 transplant centers in Budapest, Hungary. All patients with febrile neutropenia not responding to broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy received amphotericin B deoxycholate empirically. In cases of proven or probable invasive aspergillosis, intravenous voriconazole was instituted. Patients who failed to improve on initial therapy were treated with an antifungal combination, while responders were switched to oral voriconazole. A total of 38 patients died following allografting. Both centers had an autopsy rate of 100% due to central health care regulations. An infectious cause of death could be identified in 15 cases, invasive fungal disease being the most prevalent and accounting for 10 fatalities. Six patients died of invasive aspergillosis, while invasive candidiasis and mucormycosis led to a fatal outcome in 2 cases each. Despite the regular use of galactomannan antigen detections and imaging, an ante mortem diagnosis of proven/probable invasive fungal disease could only be established in 4 of 10 autopsy-verified cases (aspergillosis: 3, candidiasis: 1, mucormycosis: 0). In the remaining 6 patients, deep mycoses were missed clinically and were revealed only by postmortem histology. Present diagnostic and therapeutic strategies still seem to be suboptimal for the management of invasive fungal diseases in the high-risk allogeneic stem cell transplant population.",2007,17605727,no
[Native valve Aspergillus fumigatus endocarditis with blood culture positive and negative for galactomannan antigen. Case report and literature review].,"Native valve endocarditis caused by Aspergillus spp. is an uncommon disease with a high mortality rate. Generally, Aspergillus is isolated from affected valve in post-mortem or biopsy specimens. However, its isolation from blood cultures is exceedingly rare. We report a case of fungal endocarditis in a native mitral valve with the isolation of Aspergillus fumigatus both in valve vegetation and in blood culture bottles. The patient underwent valve replacement and antifungal treatment with voriconazole and caspofungin, but he died on post-operative day 45 with disseminated aspergillosis confirmed by necropsy. Paradoxically, galactomannan antigen detection in serum was negative. This is the third case of Aspergillus endocarditis with positive blood culture reported in the literature.",2007,17604438,no
False positive galactomannan results in adult hematological patients treated with piperacillin-tazobactam.,"In this prospective study including 78 adult patients with haematological malignancy (90 episodes) we performed galactomannan (GM) (Platelia Aspergillus) screening twice weekly for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. There were five proven and four probable invasive aspergillosis cases. The sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values were 100, 88, 47 and 100%, respectively. There were eight patients with false positive GM (10.2%). In six patients the false GM reactivity was due to the administration of piperacillin-tazobactam (P-T). A significant association was found between false positive GM (= or > 0.5) and the administration of P-T (p < 0.01). Two other patients with no invasive aspergillosis (2.5%) and false GM reactivity had graft versus host disease (GVHD) and one of them had also mucositis grade IV. The kinetic patterns of false positive GM due to P-T is discussed.",2007,17604427,no
A model of cerebral aspergillosis in non-immunosuppressed nursing rats.,"Central nervous system aspergillosis is an often fatal complication of invasive Aspergillus infection. Relevant disease models are needed to study the pathophysiology of cerebral aspergillosis and to develop novel therapeutic approaches. This study presents a model of central nervous system aspergillosis that mimics important aspects of human disease. Eleven-day-old non-immunosuppressed male Wistar rats were infected by an intracisternal injection of 10 mul of a conidial suspension of Aspergillus fumigatus. An inoculum of 7.18 log(10) colony-forming units (CFU) consistently produced cerebral infection and resulted in death of all animals (n = 25) within 3-10 days. Median survival time was 3 days. Histomorphologically, all animals developed intracerebral abscesses (2-26 per brain) containing abundant fungal hyphae and neutrophils. Fungal culture of cortical homogenates yielded maximal growth on day 3 after infection (5.4 log(10) CFU/g, n = 15) that declined over time. Galactomannan concentrations in cortical homogenates, assessed as an index for hyphal burden, peaked on days 3-5. Fungal infection spread to peripheral organs in 83% of animals. Fungal burden in lung, liver, spleen and kidney was two orders of magnitude lower than in the brain. The successful establishment of a model of cerebral aspergillosis in a non-immunosuppressed host provides the opportunity to investigate mechanisms of disease and to develop novel treatment regimens for this commonly fatal infection.",2007,17602232,no
Prospective screening in liver transplant recipients by panfungal PCR-ELISA for early diagnosis of invasive fungal infections.,"Invasive fungal infections after liver transplantation (LT) have resulted in high mortality and potentially fatal complications. This study was undertaken to determine the accuracy of the panfungal polymerase chain reaction enzyme link immunosorbent assay (PCR-ELISA) method in early diagnosis of invasive fungal infections in liver transplant recipients (LTRs). A total of 48 liver recipients (cadaver donors) were followed for fungal infections for a period of at least 6 months. All clinical samples were cultured and a direct microscopic examination was performed. Blood samples were cultured by bedside inoculation onto BACTEC medium. Whole blood specimens were collected prospectively once per week and were evaluated for any invasive fungal infections by panfungal PCR and PCR-ELISA. Among 48 transplant recipients between September 2004 and January 2006 (22 females, 28 males, mean age = 34.4 yr), 40 recipients (83.3%) had Candida colonization in different sites of their body before LT. In proven and probable recipients for panfungal PCR-ELISA, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 83.3%, 91.7%, 76.9%, and 94.3%, respectively. By PCR assay, fungal infections were diagnosed in 10 recipients (20.8%). The mean interval time from transplantation to development of fungal infection was 61.4 days (range, 20-150 days) and time of infection in blood before any clinical signs was 7-70 days with mean of 21.4 days. The etiologic agents were Candida albicans (9 cases) and Aspergillus fumigatus (1 case). Use of PCR-ELISA in LTRs may not only improve the ability of early diagnosis of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) when positive results are obtained, but also would provide more confidence to exclude a diagnosis of IFIs when negative results are obtained.",2007,17600362,no
Prospective Aspergillus galactomannan antigen testing in pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.,"The galactomannan (GM) assay is an approved noninvasive test for detection of invasive aspergillosis (IA) that has been validated in adult patients with hematologic malignancies who are undergoing bone marrow transplantation. There have been few studies with this assay in pediatric patients, but early reports suggest that there may be differences in the performance such that false-positive GM tests in pediatric patients are more common than in adult patients.We performed a prospective study in pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with twice-weekly sampling for GM detection during the highest risk periods of neutropenia and graft-versus-host disease. We analyzed 826 serum samples from 64 patients, including 15 serum samples from one patient diagnosed with probable IA according to defined criteria.Twenty of 811 samples tested positive on repeat testing (specificity, 97.5% 95% CI: 96.2-98.4%) including samples from 8 of 63 patients without clinical evidence of IA according to study criteria (specificity, 87.3%The GM assay holds promise for early, noninvasive diagnosis of IA in high-risk children and false-positive results were not common or unexplainable. This study supports further validation of this assay in a large-scale, pediatric-dedicated format.",2007,17596794,no
Use of bronchoalveolar lavage to detect galactomannan for diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis among nonimmunocompromised hosts.,"Pulmonary aspergillosis in nonimmunocompromised hosts, although rare, is being increasingly recognized. The diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis is difficult, since the recovery of Aspergillus from respiratory samples cannot differentiate colonization from invasion. We assessed the role of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in detecting galactomannan (GM) for diagnosing pulmonary aspergillosis in 73 nonimmunocompromised patients with pulmonary infiltrates for whom the test was ordered. Six patients had pulmonary aspergillosis, two each with acute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis, and aspergilloma. All six patients had a BAL GM level of >/=1.18. The sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value (NPV) for a BAL GM level of >/=1.0 were 100%, 88.1%, and 100%, respectively. Notably, the positive predictive value (PPV) was only 42.9%, likely reflecting the low prevalence of pulmonary aspergillosis among nonimmunosuppressed patients. The combination of BAL microscopy and culture had a sensitivity and NPV similar to those of BAL GM detection but a higher specificity and PPV (92.5% and 54.6%, respectively). Moreover, a BAL GM test did not identify any cases that were not diagnosed by conventional methods like microscopy and culture. In conclusion, there was no conclusive benefit of determining BAL GM levels in the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis among nonimmunocompromised hosts. Given the likelihood of false-positive results, a BAL GM test should not be ordered routinely in this population.",2007,17596367,no
Detection of circulating galactomannan in serum samples for diagnosis of Penicillium marneffei infection and cryptococcosis among patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus.,"Galactomannan (GM) is a heteropolysaccharide in the cell walls of most Aspergillus and Penicillium species. Cross-reactivity of Cryptococcus neoformans galactoxylomannan in an Aspergillus GM test has also been reported. In this study, we used a Platelia Aspergillus enzyme immunoassay kit (Bio-Rad) to test serum samples obtained from 48 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients (15 with penicilliosis [7 with fungemia alone, 4 with cavitary lung lesions alone, 3 with both fungemia and cavitary lung lesions, and 1 with disseminated disease], 22 with cryptococcosis [11 with fungemia alone, 5 with cavitary lung lesions, 3 with both, and 3 with meningitis alone], and 11 without any invasive fungal infection [control]) for GM levels. None of the patients had aspergillosis or concurrent use of piperacillin-tazobactam or amoxicillin-clavulanate. The median time between diagnosis of fungal infection and collection of serum samples was 0 days for penicilliosis and 1.5 days for cryptococcosis. Of patients with penicilliosis, cryptococcosis, and controls, 73.3%, 13.6%, and 9%, respectively, had GM optical density (OD) indices of >0.5 (P = 0.0001). GM OD indices were higher for penicilliosis (median OD index, 4.419 range, 0.158 to >20) than for cryptococcosis (median, 0.247",2007,17596363,no
Performance characteristics of a polyclonal enzyme immunoassay for the quantitation of Histoplasma antigen in human urine samples.,"An antigen detection assay was prepared with rabbit anti- Histoplasma antibodies to detect and quantitate Histoplasma capsulatum antigen in urine samples. By using a 4-parameter curve fit, the assay calibration ranges from 2 to 1,000 enzyme immunoassay (EIA) units. We compared results for 99 urine samples with those of a reference laboratory, half of which tested positive or equivocal by that reference laboratory. Performance characteristics were further defined by studying the assay linearity, precision, percentage of positive agreement, and percentage of negative agreement. An acceptable correlation with the reference laboratory (R2=0.7174) was obtained with results ranging from less than 2 (negative samples) to 132 EIA units by the new method. Compared with the reference laboratory, the percentage of agreement for positive samples, excluding equivocal samples, was 92% and for negative samples was 98%. Crossreactivity occurred with culture filtrates of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Coccidioides immitis, and Blastomyces dermatiditis. No cross-reactivity was observed with Candida albicans or Aspergillus fumigatus culture filtrates. The current EIA for the detection and quantitation of H capsulatum antigen in urine specimens is a valid assay that agrees well with results from an established reference laboratory.",2007,17580268,no
Invasive aspergillosis in the intensive care unit.,"Data regarding the incidence of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in the intensive care unit (ICU) are scarce, and the incidence varies. An incidence of 5.8% in a medical ICU has been reported. The majority of patients did not have a hematological malignancy, and conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and liver failure became recognized as risk factors. Diagnosis of IA remains difficult. Mechanical ventilation makes it difficult to interpret clinical signs, and radiological diagnoses are clouded by underlying lung pathologies. The significance of a positive respiratory culture result is greatly uncertain, because cultures of respiratory specimens have low sensitivity (50%) and specificity (20%-70%, depending on whether the patient is immunocompromised). The use of serologic markers has never been validated in an ICU population. Limited experience with the detection of galactomannan in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens has yielded promising results.

"IL-1alpha, IL-1ra and IL-8 are differentially induced by Candida in experimental oral candidiasis.","To investigate the expression of interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), IL-1ra and IL-8 by the oral epithelium challenged by various Candida species.In vitro candidiasis was induced by C. albicans wild type SC5314, its EFG1, CPH1 and secretory aspartyl proteinase (SAP) mutants and, ATCC isolates of C. albicans, C. tropicalis and C. dubliniensis using a reconstituted human oral epithelium (RHOE) model. IL-1alpha, IL-1ra and IL-8 levels in culture media were quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at 12, 24 and 48 h. Fungal invasion and IL-1ra expression in RHOE were detected by periodic acid-Schiff staining and immunohistochemistry.Overall, the invasive Candida induced relatively higher levels of IL-1alpha, IL-1ra and IL-8 in the culture media than the noninvasive isolates. IL-1alpha and IL-1ra levels induced by Candida with hyphal invasion were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those induced by the isolates without hyphal invasion at 12, 24 and 48 h. Candida albicans SC5314 induced IL-1ra expression in RHOE at 12 and 24 h but not at 48 h consistent with its hyphal invasion while the noninvasive mutants and non-albicans Candida induced IL-1ra expression at 48 h.The cytokine expression profiles in experimental oral candidiasis may be associated with the invasive potential of Candida.",2007,17577331,no
"Diagnostic value of DNA, (1-3)-beta-d-glucan, and galactomannan detection in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage of mice experimentally infected with Aspergillus terreus.","The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of Aspergillus terreus-specific DNA, (1-3)-beta-d-glucan (BDG), and galactomannan (GM) in immunosuppressed mice infected intravenously with A. terreus conidia and sacrificed in groups of 12 each on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. A. terreus-specific DNA, BDG, and GM in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were detected by nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR), Fungitell kit (Associates of Cape Cod, E. Falmouth, MA), and Aspergillus Platelia kit (Bio-Rad, Marnes-laCoquette, France), respectively. Cultures of lung homogenate of all the animals yielded A. terreus. The BDG positivity, GM positivity, and nPCR positivity in serum specimens were 43%, 78%, and 73%, respectively. Combined detection enhanced the positivity to 95% for A. terreus DNA and GM, 83% for GM and BDG, and 95% for DNA, GM, and BDG. In BAL, the GM positivity and nPCR positivity were 80% and 81%, respectively, whereas combined detection increased the positivity to 98%.

Covalent immobilization of glucose oxidase onto poly(styrene-co-glycidyl methacrylate) monodisperse fluorescent microspheres synthesized by dispersion polymerization.,"In this study, micron-sized poly(styrene-co-glycidyl methacrylate) (PSt-GMA) fluorescent microspheres of 5.1microm in diameter were synthesized via dispersion polymerization of styrene and glycidyl methacrylate in the presence of 1,4-bis(5-phenyloxazol-2-yl) benzene (POPOP), which provided surface functional groups for covalent immobilization of enzymes. In an effort to study the biocompatibility of the microspheres' surface, glucose oxidase and beta-d-(+)-glucose were selected as a catalytic system for enzymatic assays. A colorimetric method was adopted in evaluating enzymatic activity by introducing horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Both the immobilization amount and the apparent activity of immobilized glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger (GOD) were determined at different conditions. The results show that the immobilized enzymes retained approximately 28 to 34% activity, as compared with free enzymes, without pronounced alteration of the optimum pH and temperature. Kinetics studies show that the corresponding values of K(m) and V(max) are 23.2944 mM and 21.6450M/min.mg GOD for free enzymes and 35.1780 mM and 15.4799M/min.mg GOD for immobilized enzymes. The operational stability studies show that immobilized GOD could retain nearly 50% initial activity after being washed 20 times. The results suggest that the resultant PSt-GMA fluorescent microspheres provide a suitable surface for covalent immobilizing biomolecules therefore, they have the potential of being used in fluorescence-based immunoassays in high-throughput screening or biosensors.",2007,17562322,no
"[Detection of some zoonotic agents in the domestic pigeon (Columba livia) in the city of Chillán, Chile].","There is an increase in the population of doves (Columba livia) as well as their contact with healthy and immunocompromised hosts.detection of some zoonotic agents of the domestic pigeon (Columba livia) in Chillán city, Chile.From October 2002 to September 2003, 100 domestic pigeons were captured. Blood, organs and intestine contents were sampled from each pigeon. The samples were cultivated in different kinds of agar according to the searched microorganism. Fungi were typified by morphological studies after staining with 2% methylene blue. For the detection of Chlamydophila psittaci a commercial Elisa kit (IDEXX) was used.Pigeons were registered positive for: chlamydiosis (11%), staphylococcus (8%), salmonellosis (4%) and aspergillosis (1%). No pigeon had evidence of cryptococcosis and listeriosis.these results confirm that domestic pigeon could act as vector of zoonotic agents of public health importance.",2007,17554438,no
[A clinical analysis of 23 cases of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis].,"To describe the clinical characteristics of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA).The clinical presentations, serologic results, lung function data, chest radiology and the results of treatment of 23 patients with ABPA in Peking Union Medical College Hospital were retrospectively analyzed.There were 11 males and 12 females, with a mean age of (34.0 +/- 13.2) yrs. Tuberculosis, pneumonia, lung cancer and Wegener's granulomatosis were initially diagnosed in 12, 3, 2 and 1 cases respectively. Cough was present in all patients and sputum production in 22 cases, wheeze in 18, sputum plugs in 16, fever in 15 (high degree of fever in 4), hemoptysis in 12, chest pain/backache in 8 and weight loss in 7 cases. Forced expired volume in one second (FEV(1)) was (54.7 +/- 24.1)% predicted, and FEV(1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) was (62.5 +/- 11.9)%. The FEV(1) reversibility was found in 56% (9/16) of the patients. Chest CT were performed in 22 cases. Patchy infiltrations were present in 21, central bronchiectasis in 17, nodular opacities in 9, mucoid impaction (glover-finger/band linear opacities) in 6, consolidation in 5, and mediastinal adenopathy in 11 cases, while 17 cases presented fleeting infiltrations. Twenty-two patients were treated with prednisone plus itraconazole and 17 patients were followed. The median follow up time was 26.2 months (13 days -19 years). Pulmonary infiltrations relapsed in 9 patients and not appeared for more than 6 years in only one patient.ABPA was mostly misdiagnosed as tuberculosis. Wheeze is present in almost all patients with ABPA, which can be useful in differentiation from tuberculosis. Obstructive ventilatory defect, peripheral blood eosinophilia, fleeting pulmonary infiltration and central bronchiectasis were features of ABPA. Measurement of total IgE, A.fumigatus-specific IgE levels and immediate cutaneous reaction to A.fumigatus are helpful for confirmation of the diagnosis.",2007,17547802,no
Reconstitution of apoglucose oxidase with FAD conjugates for biosensoring of progesterone.,"The reconstitution of Aspergillus niger apoglucose oxidase (apoGOx) with FAD conjugates for biosensoring of progesterone was investigated. ApoGOx prepared by partial unfolding of the protein under acidic conditions consisted of reconstitutable monomers (50+/-10%), reconstitutable dimers (20+/-10%) and irreversibly aggregated oligomers (30+/-20%). Incubation of monomeric apoGOx with FAD or N(6)-(6-aminohexyl)-FAD (ahFAD) restored glucose oxidase (GOx) activity and induced dimerization with stoichiometric incorporation of FAD. N(6)-(6-aminohexyl)-FAD progesterone conjugates also induced dimerization. However, holoenzyme reconstitution required relatively high concentrations of apoprotein and was dependent on the type of conjugate. Restoration to 25-50% of the original enzyme activity was obtained. Binding of the FAD-progesterone conjugates might hinder the closure of a protein lid needed for dimer formation. Our results illustrate the prospects of FAD conjugates in sensitive detection of progesterone in biological matrices in a biosensor based on the recombination of apoGOx with progesterone-conjugated FAD.",2007,17544346,no
"Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in cancer patients with pulmonary aspergillosis recovering from neutropenia: Proof of principle, description, and clinical and research implications.","Assessing the outcome of patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis by using conventional criteria is difficult, particularly when clinical and radiologic worsening coincides with neutrophil recovery. Usually, it is assumed that this deterioration is related to progressive aspergillosis, prompting changes in patient management. However, its temporal relation with neutrophil recovery suggests that it may be caused by an immune reconstitution syndrome (IRIS). Galactomannan is an Aspergillus-specific polysaccharide that is released during aspergillosis and is detected by the serum galactomannan test, which has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. In this study, the authors used sequential galactomannan testing to distinguish IRIS responses from progressive aspergillosis.From April 2001 to December 2006, patients with hematologic malignancies underwent galactomannan screening during periods when they were at risk. The clinical and laboratory findings from patients who had >or=2 consecutive positive galactomannan assays (optical density, >or=0.5) were reviewed.Nineteen neutropenic patients with aspergillosis developed clinical and radiologic pulmonary deterioration during neutrophil recovery. Deterioration coincided with microbiologic response, as documented by rapid normalization of serum galactomannan, and, in 16 patients, was followed by complete clinical response and survival at 3 months, although there were no changes in antifungal therapy. The 3 patients who died during the first month had no evidence of aspergillosis at autopsy examination.The authors propose that IRIS was responsible for the current findings and provide a definition for the syndrome. They also recommend serial galactomannan testing to guide aspergillosis management. Declining galactomannan values imply IRIS with an aspergillus response and obviate the need for invasive procedures and alternative antifungal therapies, whereas persistent galactomannan elevation indicates progressive aspergillosis and requires prompt treatment modification.",2007,17525971,no
Detection of deoxynivalenol based on a single-chain fragment variable of the antideoxynivalenol antibody.,"Immunological detection of low molecular weight toxins, such as deoxynivalenol using single-chain antibody fragment (scFv), is a potentially novel and safe method of diagnosing fungal infection and food contamination. To develop a deoxynivalenol detection procedure based on scFv, deoxynivalenol was first conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for immunoassay. Deoxynivalenol was initially activated using N-[p-maleimidophenyl] isocyanate and subsequently conjugated to S-acetyl thioglycolic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated HRP. Sodium dodecylsulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis confirmed covalent attachment of deoxynivalenol to HRP successfully. Competitive direct-ELISA based on antideoxynivalenol scFv was used to detect deoxynivalenol in spiked and natural contaminated wheat samples, and the results showed that scFv is applicable in deoxynivalenol detection of contaminated wheat samples. This work confirms that sensitive and specific scFv against fungal toxins can be applicable in diagnosis of fungal infection.",2007,17521405,no
Aspergillus galactomannan antigen in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in lung transplant recipients.,"The clinical utility of Platelia Aspergillus enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for galactomannan (GM) antigen detection in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in lung transplant recipients is not known.BAL fluid samples from consecutive lung transplant recipients who underwent bronchoscopy were prospectively analyzed for GM.A total of 333 BAL samples from 116 patients were tested. Invasive aspergillosis was documented in 5.2% (6/116) of the patients. Samples analyzed included 9 BALs from two patients with proven IA, 19 BALs from four patients with probable IA, and 305 BALs from 110 patients without IA. At the index cutoff value of > or =0.5, the sensitivity was 60% specificity was 95%, with positive and negative likelihood ratios of 14 and 0.41, respectively. Increasing the index cutoff value to > or =1.0 yielded a sensitivity of 60%, a specificity of 98%, and the positive and negative likelihood ratios of 28 and 0.40, respectively. Two of six patients with IA receiving antifungal prophylaxis had false-negative results.A Platelia EIA index cut-off > or =1.0 in the BAL fluid in a lung transplant recipient with a compatible clinical illness may be considered as suggestive of IA.",2007,17519782,no
Systemic histoplasmosis: a 15-year retrospective institutional review of 111 patients.,"To our knowledge, an institutional review of systemic histoplasmosis has not been conducted in the United States since the major outbreaks in Indianapolis in 1978-4982. We conducted a retrospective review of all patients with systemic histoplasmosis diagnosed at Mayo Clinic over a 15-year period. The case definitions employed were based on an international consensus statement by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group (EORTC/IFICG) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group (MSG). One hundred eleven patients with systemic histoplasmosis were identified between January 1, 1991, and December 31, 2005. Of these, 78 patients had disseminated histoplasmosis and 55 patients had Histoplasma capsulatum fungemia. The mean age of patients was 55 years, 66% were male, and 98% were white. Fifty-nine percent of patients were immunocompromised. Fever was the most frequently reported symptom (63%), followed by respiratory complaints (43%) and weight loss (37%). The peripheral white blood cell count was <3000 cells/mm in 28%, hemoglobin was <10 g/dL in 29%, and platelet count was <150,000 cells/mm in 41% of patients. Liver enzymes were elevated (alanine aminotransferase >60 U/L in 39%, aspartate aminotransferase >60 U/L in 27%), alkaline phosphatase was >200 U/L in 55%, and albumin was <3.5 g/dL in 70%. Serologic and histopathologic examinations were each positive in 75% of cases, Histoplasma urine antigen screening was positive in 80%, and H. capsulatum was culture positive in 84%. Forty-seven percent of patients were sequentially treated with an amphotericin B-containing product followed by itraconazole, 31% received itraconazole alone, and 7% received an amphotericin B-containing product only. Another 13% of patients did not receive antifungal treatment, and the remaining 2% did not have treatment data available. Sixty percent of patients required hospitalization, and in hospital mortality was 6% with a median survival time of 61 days. The relapse rate was 9%, with a median relapse-free survival of 857 days. Systemic histoplasmosis should be suspected in patients who have lived in endemic areas with fever, bone marrow suppression, and elevated hepatic enzymes, particularly if they are immunocompromised. Evaluation including a combination of Histoplasma serologic screening, urine antigen assay, and fungal culture will secure the diagnosis in most cases.",2007,17505255,no
The prevention of recrudescent coccidioidomycosis after solid organ transplantation.,"Coccidioidomycosis is an endemic fungal infection of the southwestern United States that causes considerable morbidity and mortality in transplant recipients, often as the result of reactivated infection.A retrospective review of the medical records of 47 patients with prior coccidioidomycosis who underwent solid organ transplantation (18 liver, 24 kidney, 3 pancreas, and 2 combined organ) at our tertiary care academic medical center.Of 47 transplant recipients with a history of coccidioidomycosis, 44 had quiescent infection at transplantation. Of the three with active coccidioidomycosis at transplantation, two were taking azole prophylaxis and had no further coccidioidal infection after transplantation. One of the three had positive serologic findings identified only on the day of transplantation, and prophylaxis was initiated a few hours after surgery along with immunosuppression nevertheless, the treatment course was complicated by disseminated coccidioidomycosis. Seven patients did not initiate or self-discontinued prophylaxisFor patients undergoing transplantation in an area endemic for coccidioidomycosis, we recommend routine evaluation for evidence of prior infection and initiation of azole prophylaxis. For our patients with quiescent infection, azoles suppressed any recrudescent coccidioidomycosis after transplantation. The selection of patients who would benefit from prophylaxis and the optimal dose and duration of such prophylaxis should be studied further.",2007,17496533,no
Comparison of serologic evaluation via agar gel immunodiffusion and fungal culture of tissue for diagnosis of nasal aspergillosis in dogs.,"To compare the sensitivity and specificity of serologic evaluation and fungal culture of tissue for diagnosis of nasal aspergillosis in dogs.Prospective study.58 dogs with nasal discharge and 26 healthy dogs.Dogs with nasal discharge were anesthetized and underwent computed tomography and rhinoscopy nasal tissues were collected for histologic examination and fungal culture. Sera were assessed for antibodies against Aspergillus spp (healthy dog sera were used as negative control specimens). Nasal aspergillosis was diagnosed in dogs that had at least 2 of the following findings: computed tomographic characteristics consistent with aspergillosis, fungal plaques detected during rhinoscopy, and histologically detectable fungal hyphae in nasal tissue. Histologic characteristics of malignancy were diagnostic for neoplasia. Without evidence of neoplasia or fungal disease, nonfungal rhinitis was diagnosed.Among the 58 dogs, 21 had nasal aspergillosis, 25 had nonfungal rhinitis, and 12 had nasal neoplasia. Fourteen aspergillosis-affected dogs and 1 dog with nonfungal rhinitis had serum antibodies against Aspergillus spp. Fungal culture results were positive for Aspergillus spp only for 17 dogs with aspergillosis. With regard to aspergillosis diagnosis, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 67%, 98%, 93%, and 84%, respectively, for serum anti-Aspergillus antibody determination and 81%, 100%, 100%, and 90%, respectively, for fungal culture.Results suggest that seropositivity for Aspergillus spp and identification of Aspergillus spp in cultures of nasal tissue are highly suggestive of nasal aspergillosis in dogs however, negative test results do not rule out nasal aspergillosis.",2007,17472556,no
Susceptibility to opportunistic infections in HIV-infected patients with increased CD4 T-cell counts on antiretroviral therapy may be predicted by markers of dysfunctional effector memory CD4 T cells and B cells.,"HIV-infected patients responding to combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) after experiencing severe immunodeficiency may exhibit persistent immune defects and occasionally experience opportunistic infections (OIs) despite increased CD4 T-cell counts. The investigation of immune defects in such patients was examined in this study.CD4 effector memory T-cell (T(em)-cell) function [assessed by blood cytomegalovirus (CMV) interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot-forming cell assay (ELISPOT) counts] and B-cell dysregulation [assessed by serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgE levels] were examined in 27 patients with increased CD4 T-cell counts after receiving ART for over 2 years. Two of these patients and one other had developed OIs on ART and are described in detail.Serum levels of IgA and IgE were higher than reference intervals (P<0.001) and CMV IFN-gamma ELISPOT counts were lower than those in non-HIV-infected controls (P<0.001) in the HIV-infected patients. Low CMV IFN-gamma ELISPOT counts were associated with high IgA levels (r=-0.5, P=0.01, Spearman's correlation test) and segregated with high IgE levels (P=0.06, Fisher's test). CMV IFN-gamma ELISPOT counts and serum IgA and IgE levels did not change significantly over a median time of 35 (range 8-60) months after the first measurement, whereas CD4 T-cell counts increased. All three patients who experienced OIs had repeatedly low CMV IFN-gamma ELISPOT counts and increased serum levels of IgA and/or IgE.Low CD4 T(em)-cell function and B-cell dysregulation are immune defects that may persist independently of changes in the CD4 T-cell count in HIV-1-infected patients responding to ART and are associated with an increased risk of developing an OI.",2007,17461858,no
[Voriconazole as an effective therapy against pulmonary aspergillosis in a man with immunodeficiency virus-infection: a case report].,"A 45-year-old homosexual man with pneumocystis pneumonia and esophageal candidiasis tested positive in ELISA and Western blot analysis for HIV-1. His CD4+ T cell count was 43/microL and his HIV-RNA load was 250,000 copies/mL. He was treated with Trimetoprim-Sulfamethoxazole, Prednisolone and Fluconazole. Valganciclovir was added to treat CMV retinitis. During the clinical course, 21 days after admission, the patient presented with a temperature of 39 degrees C and blood analysis showed neutropenia. Cefepime and G-CSF were initiated, but new consolidation was observed in the upper left lobe in chest radiography. He underwent bronchoscopy and lavage culture was positive for Aspergillus fumigatus. Serum testing of galactomannan was also positive and pulmonary aspergillosis was diagnosed. The patient was initially treated with Micafungin but switched to Voriconazole when clinical symptoms worsened. An eventual clinical response was observed and pulmonary aspergillosis was controlled. Unfortunately, he died of sepsis due to MRSA 2 months later. Pulmonary aspergillosis is a devastating complication with poor prognosis in patients with HIV infection. Amphotericin-B has been the mainstay of pulmonary aspergillosis treatment, but reports indicate mortality exceeding 80%. Use of Voriconazole, a relatively new antifungal agent, may lower mortality with fewer adverse effects than conventional antifungal therapy.",2007,17447480,no
Assessment of Platelia Aspergillus enzyme immunoassay for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.,"This study investigated the diagnostic value of Platelia Aspergillus enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for galactomannan (GM) antigen in patients at risk of invasive aspergillosis (IA), and its association with clinical course and outcome.A total of 304 blood samples were collected from 189 patients at risk of IA during a 1-year period at a tertiary referral center. Classification of IA was made on the basis of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer case definitions.Of the 189 patients, 5 had proven IA, 9 had probable IA, 26 had possible IA, and 149 had no IA. Diagnostic levels of GM were detected in 80% of proven and in 77% of probable IA cases. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for this assay, using a 1.5 index cut-off value, were 78.6%, 93.9%, 55.0%, and 97.9%, respectively. With the 0.5 index cut-off value, the sensitivity would increase to 100%. A close relationship was found between clinical course and the kinetics of GM indices in survivors.The Platelia Aspergillus EIA is a useful screening test for the detection of IA. Regular monitoring of the kinetics of GM-EIA indices is a useful predictor of clinical course and outcome.",2007,17446963,yes
Optimization of the cutoff value for the Aspergillus double-sandwich enzyme immunoassay.,"Many health care centers worldwide use the Platelia Aspergillus enzyme immunoassay (PA-EIA Bio-Rad Laboratories) for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA). A cutoff optical density (OD) index of 1.5 was originally recommended by the manufacturer, but in practice, most institutions use lower cutoff values. Moreover, a cutoff OD index of 0.5 was recently approved in the United States. In the present study, we set out to optimize the cutoff level by performing a retrospective analysis of PA-EIA values for samples that had been obtained prospectively from adult patients at risk for IA at 2 European health care centers.In total, 239 treatment episodes were included of which there were 19 episodes of proven IA and 19 episodes of probable IA. Per-episode and per-test analyses and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine the optimal cutoff value.In the per-episode analysis, lowering the cutoff OD index for positivity from 1.5 to 0.5 increased the overall sensitivity by 21% (from 76.3% to 97.4%) but decreased the overall specificity by 7% (from 97.5% to 90.5%). Requiring 2 consecutive samples with an OD index > or = 0.5 resulted in the highest test accuracy, with an improved positive predictive value. At a cutoff OD index of 0.5, the antigen test result was positive during the week before conventional diagnosis in 65% of cases and during the week of diagnosis in 79.5% of cases.A cutoff OD index of 0.5--identical to the approved cutoff in the United States--improves the overall performance of the PA-EIA for adult hematology patients.",2007,17443470,no
Diagnosing fungal infections in neutropenic patients.,"Fungal infections are among the most serious complications in neutropenic patients. A major problem that has compromised management of fungal infections is healthcare professionals' inability to recognize the infections when they occur. No adequate diagnostic tools exist to detect many of the fungal infections. Early diagnosis of disseminated candidiasis is a challenge because only 35%-50% of neutropenic patients have positive blood cultures (Bodey, 1997), and radiologic tests have low specificity in that patient population. For example, a routine chest x-ray can be negative, yet a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest can be positive for pneumonia the next day. Therefore, fungal infections often are advanced before diagnostic confirmation thus, overall outcomes are poor. A great effort has been invested in developing serologic tests to detect circulating antigens of fungi.",2007,17441394,no

Cloning and functional expression of the mitochondrial alternative oxidase of Aspergillus fumigatus and its induction by oxidative stress.,"Aspergillus fumigatus possesses a branched mitochondrial electron transport chain, with both cyanide-sensitive and -insensitive oxygen-consumption activities. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species mediate signaling for alternative oxidase (AOX) expression. A 1173 bp-long Afaox gene encoding a 40 kDa protein has been cloned and identified. Recombinant constructs containing the Afaox ORF were transformed into Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae for heterologous expression. In A. fumigatus, AOX activity and mRNA expression were both induced with menadione or paraquat, suggesting an important role of AOX under oxidative stress. Therefore, positive transformants showed a cyanide-resistant and salicylhydroxamic acid-sensitive respiration, whereas in control cells the oxygen uptake was completely inhibited after KCN addition.",2007,17425662,no
Innate responses to Aspergillus: role of C1q and pentraxin 3 in nasal polyposis.,"Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) and complement component C1q are humoral factors of innate immunity, produced at sites of inflammation, and are essential in immune defense against several microbes such as Aspergillus, which is commonly implicated in nasal polyposis.PTX3 and C1q were measured in nasal polyp tissue, normal nasal mucosa, and serum of patients and healthy subjects. Immunohistochemistry for the two proteins was done on normal nasal mucosa and nasal polyps. In addition, PTX3 and C1q production from mononuclear cells from patients and healthy subjects was assessed.Normal nasal mucosa was found to have 100-fold higher levels of PTX3 compared with serum. No measurable local increase of PTX3 was observed in polyps compared with normal mucosa. Immunohistochemistry revealed PTX3 expression in the lining of blood vessels both within normal mucosa and nasal polyps. PTX3 also was present in mononuclear cells infiltrating nasal polyps. C1q levels were higher in polyps than in normal nasal mucosa.High levels of PTX3 are present in normal nasal mucosa, suggesting a role in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Elevated C1q levels in nasal polyps might be indicative of an ongoing inflammatory response in the nasal mucosa in these patients.",2007,17424885,no
(1 --> 3)-beta-D-glucan--a new marker for the early serodiagnosis of deep-seated fungal infections in humans.,"Until recently, the diagnosis of systemic mycoses was mainly based on traditional methods producing late and inconclusive results. Currently used methods of serological diagnostics are generally based on detection of cell wall components of selected pathogenic fungal species--mannoproteins, functioning as a antigenic markers. There are big hopes for adaptation of commercially available assays to detect (1 --> 3)-beta-D-glucan because of the fact that its presence in blood and normally sterile body fluids should lead to initiation of the diagnostic workup of invasive fungal infection. Monitoring (1 --> 3)-beta-D-glucan antigenemia is useful in predicting the therapeutic outcome of patients with invasive aspergillosis and in combination with galactomannan detection to identify false-positive reactions. The simultaneous use of both tests is probably more pertinent for the differentiation between yeast and mould infections.",2007,17419183,no
Update on the contribution of galactomannan for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.,"The diagnosis of invasive fungal infections (IFI) remains a challenge, particularly for diseases caused by filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus species. Unfortunately, many patients affected by these conditions are not identified before autopsy. Therefore, there is a need for new diagnostic methods for IFI. Galactomannan is a soluble antigen released during hyphal growth in tissues. A commercially available sandwich ELISA assay that detects galactomannan has been used in Europe for many years and is now approved for use in the USA. The test has an excellent negative predictive value in the detection of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in high-risk patients. In addition, it is more sensitive than culture and allows IA to be diagnosed before clinical manifestations occur. However, false-negative and false-positive results in certain populations are the main limitations to its use. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current knowledge about galactomannan testing in patients at risk for IA.",2007,17410480,no
A simple method for quantitative determination of polysaccharides in fungal cell walls.,"A simple and reliable method for quantitative determination of cell wall polymers in fungal cell with an s.e.m. of 5% is described. This protocol is based on the hydrolysis by sulfuric acid of beta-glucan, mannan, galactomannan and chitin present at different levels in the wall of yeasts and filamentous fungi into their corresponding monomers glucose, mannose, galactose and glucosamine. The released monosaccharides are subsequently separated and quantified by high-performance ionic chromatography coupled to pulse amperometry detection, with a detection limit of 1.0 mug ml(-1). This procedure is well suited to screening a large collection of yeast mutants or to evaluating effects of environmental conditions on cell wall polysaccharide content. This procedure is also applicable to other fungal species, including Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. Results can be obtained in 3 d.",2007,17406560,no
Treatment of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis by voriconazole in nonimmunocompromised patients.,"There is no recognized medical treatment for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) apart from surgery in patients with simple aspergilloma. To evaluate the efficacy of voriconazole in this setting, we conducted a retrospective multicenter study over a 3-year period.For inclusion in the study, patients had to have received voriconazole for treatment of confirmed or probable CPA with a follow-up of at least 6 months. Clinical, radiologic, and mycologic data were collected at baseline, every 2 to 3 months, and at the end of treatment or at the date point.Twenty-four patients were included in the study, among which 9 patients presented with chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis and 15 presented with chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis (CNPA). Voriconazole was given as a first-line treatment to 13 patients. The median duration of treatment and follow-up were 6.5 and 10 months, respectively. Three patients had to stop treatment with voriconazole because of toxicity. Symptoms and imagery findings were improved in 16 of 24 patients and 17 of 24 patients, respectively, at the end of follow-up. Mycology, which was positive at baseline in 21 of 23 patients, was negative in 18 of 19 patients at the end of follow-up serologic test results were also negative in 6 of 19 evaluable patients, all of whom had CNPA. Improved radioclinical findings and mycologic eradication were observed at the end of follow-up in 11 of 19 patients (58%). Patients in whom the disease was controlled had a significantly longer median duration of treatment than patients in whom it was uncontrolled (9 vs 6 months, respectivelyVoriconazole provides effective treatment of CPA with an acceptable level of toxicity.",2007,17400661,no
State-of-the-art treatment of coccidioidomycosis skeletal infections.,"Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection endemic to the southwestern United States. Typically a respiratory illness, coccidioidomycosis can rarely present as extrapulmonary infection. Skeletal coccidioidomycosis occurs in 20% to 50% of disseminated infections. Skeletal coccidioidomycosis is a chronic and progressive infection that eventually results in bone destruction and loss of function and often involves adjacent structures, such as joints, muscles, and tendons and other soft tissues. Sinus tract formation may occur. This infection may be multifocal. Although radiographs, white blood cell count scans, and other imaging methods identify and define relevant abnormalities, histopathologic examination with culture of the involved bone is the only means to confirm the diagnosis. Serologic testing is adjunctive, and complement fixation titers can be evaluated serially to assess response to treatment. A number of studies addressing the efficacy of various antifungal agents have been performed, and the results of these studies as they pertain to skeletal coccidioidomycosis are summarized herein. Among the various studies, response rates ranged from 23% to 100%, but relapse was common. A combination of medical therapy-often, itraconazole or fluconazole-and surgical débridement is often needed to control skeletal coccidioidomycosis. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical to avoid long-term problems with chronically infected bones and joints. Anatomical issues, diagnostic studies, and data related to treatment of this form of extrapulmonary coccidioidomycosis are reviewed in this article.",2007,17395727,no
Advances in the serological diagnosis of invasive Aspergillus infections in patients with haematological disorders.,"A reliable diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in patients with haematological malignancies is seldom achieved antemortem. Conventional laboratory diagnostic methods are insensitive and time-consuming, resulting in late diagnosis and treatment and contributing to unacceptably high mortality. As a result, routine antifungal prophylaxis and early empirical treatment have been recommended. However, overtreatment associated with these strategies results in increased toxicity and cost. The use of sensitive and rapid non-culture-based diagnostic assays, such as detection of Aspergillus antigens (galactomannan, beta-D-glucan) or detection of genomic DNA sequences may allow a shift in emphasis from empirical to pre-emptive therapy, especially when substantiated by suggestive radiological findings. These new tools may be used to confirm a presumed diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis, or, when used to screen high-risk patients, may identify an infection at the early stage of disease. The excellent negative predictive value of these assays should convince clinicians to withhold antifungal therapy in persistently febrile neutropenic patients with no other signs of fungal infection. On the other hand, consecutive positive results in a high-risk population should at least trigger a complete diagnostic work-up. This review will focus on the diagnostic utility as well as on the pitfalls of serial screening for the presence of circulating fungal antigens in haematology patients.",2007,17394605,no
[Interactions and false positive results of galactomannan antigen detection for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis].,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised hosts, with a survival rate lower than 50%. Although proven diagnosis of IA requires histopathological evidence of deep-tissue invasion, eventually supported by microbiological cultures, critical conditions of patients often hamper invasive diagnostic procedures, and many IA cases are not diagnosed during life. Detection of circulating galactomannan antigens is a non-invasive method widely used to support the diagnosis of IA. However, results of test performance have been variable and, in particular, the method shows specificity problems due to cross reactions and false positive results caused by other microorganisms, foods, antibiotics, graft versus host disease and particular physiological conditions of premature infants. It appears therefore mandatory to know exactly all these possible interactions, in order to properly evaluate GM test results and correctly apply them to the diagnosis of IA and to clinical practice.",2007,17380086,no
An extracellular matrix glues together the aerial-grown hyphae of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Pulmonary infections due to Aspergillus fumigatus result from the development of a colony of tightly associated hyphae in contact with the air, either in the alveoli (invasive aspergillosis) or in an existing cavity (aspergilloma). The fungal ball observed in vivo resembles an aerial colony obtained in agar medium in vitro more than a mycelial mass obtained in liquid shaken conditions that have been classically used to date to study A. fumigatus physiology. For this reason, we embarked on an analysis of the characteristics of A. fumigatus colonies grown in aerial static conditions. (i) Under static aerial conditions, mycelial growth is greater than in shaken, submerged conditions. (ii) The colony surface of A. fumigatus revealed the presence of an extracellular hydrophobic matrix that acts as a cohesive linkage bonding hyphae into a contiguous sheath. (iii) The extracellular matrix is composed of galactomannan, alpha1,3 glucans, monosaccharides and polyols, melanin and proteins including major antigens and hydrophobins. (iv) A. fumigatus colonies were more resistant to polyenes than shake, submerged mycelium. This is the first analysis of the three dimensional structure of a mycelial colony. Knowledge of this multicellular organization will impact our future understanding of the pathobiology of aerial mold pathogens.",2007,17371405,no
Galactoxylomannan does not exhibit cross-reactivity in the platelia Aspergillus enzyme immunoassay.,"Given the recent report of a false-positive result in the Platelia Aspergillus enzyme immunoassay in a patient with cryptococcosis and in yeast extracts and purified galactoxylomannan of Cryptococcus neoformans, we evaluated culture extracts, purified polysaccharides, clinical specimens, and specimens from animals following experimental infection.

IgE-bearing cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and allergen-specific IgE levels in sera from RAO-affected horses.,"Recurrent airway obstruction (RAO) is a common condition in stabled horses characterized by small airway inflammation, airway neutrophilia and obstruction following exposure of susceptible horses to mouldy hay and straw and is thus regarded as a hypersensitivity reaction to mould spores. However, the role of immunoglobulin E antibodies (IgE) in the pathogenesis of RAO is unclear. We hypothesized that the number of cells with receptor-bound IgE in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and IgE levels in serum would be higher in RAO-affected than in healthy horses living in the same environment. Therefore, IgE-positive (+) cells were identified by immunocytochemistry on cytospins from BALF and counted. IgE levels against the mould extracts Aspergillus fumigatus (Asp. f.) and Alternaria alternata (Alt. a.) and the recombinant mould allergen Aspergillus fumigatus 8 (rAsp f 8) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the sera of seven RAO-affected and 22 clinically healthy mature horses housed in the same conventional stable environment. After correcting for the number of neutrophils, there were no significant differences in IgE+ cells on cytospins from BALF between both groups of horses (5% versus 7%, P > 0.1). Serum IgE levels against the mould extracts were significantly higher in RAO-affected than in clinically healthy horses [median = 119 versus 66 relative ELISA units (REU), P < 0.05]. Furthermore, significantly more RAO-affected than healthy horses had detectable serum IgE against the recombinant allergen rAsp f 8 (4/7 and 3/22, respectively, P < 0.05). Age had no significant effect on BALF cell ratios or on specific serum IgE levels. These results show that high IgE levels against mould antigens are associated with RAO under controlled environmental conditions but ranges of mould-specific serum IgE levels overlapped too much between diseased and clinically healthy animals to be of any diagnostic value. Further studies are needed to assess whether IgE-mediated reactions contribute to the pathogenesis of RAO.",2007,17359454,no
"[Allergen activity of xerophilic fungus, Aspergillus restrictus].","The typical xerophilic fungi, Aspergillus restrictus, have been very frequently detected in house dust by low water activity medium. Since the composition of fungal allergens are affected culture and extract condition, we considered the influence in A. restrictus in order to develop new allergen of xerophilic fungi.The 4 different extract of A. restrictus were obtained from various fermentation and extraction methods. These extracts were studied for specific IgE in sera of patients with asthma. The cross-reactivity between A. restrictus and A. fumigatus were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) inhibition. Then, component analysis of A. restrictus allergens was examined by SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting.In ELISA, IgE antibodies against four extracts of A. restrictus were found in sera of 20-48%. In ELISA inhibition using sera obtained from 11 asthma patients, A. fumigatus antigen solution inhibited the reaction of A. restrictus with 5 asthma patients.These results indicated that A. restrictus may be important as a causative agent in adult asthma patients. However, it was suggested that some preparation methods of an extract influence activity. Furthermore, cross-reactivity was found between A. restrictus and A. fumigatus.",2007,17347596,no
Histoplasmosis-associated cross-reactivity in the BioRad Platelia Aspergillus enzyme immunoassay.,We observed false-positive results in the Platelia Aspergillus enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) for specimens from patients with histoplasmosis and mice with experimental infection.

New approaches to invasive fungal infections in acute leukemia and hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients.,"Recognition and treatment of invasive fungal infections in acute leukemia and hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients are important clinical challenges. New diagnostic tools, such as fungal serologic assays and high-resolution CT scans, offer the hope for earlier initiation of antifungal therapy and improved treatment results. New antifungal agents offer choices that in some cases are less toxic than older drugs and in other cases are more efficacious. Combining the new diagnostic tools with new drugs, novel strategies are being evaluated to change our approaches to these deadly infections.",2007,17336260,no
Potential role of the cellular allergen stimulation test (CAST) in diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in cystic fibrosis.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a severe complication in cystic fibrosis (CF), which is difficult to identify because of overlapping unspecific diagnostic features with common CF-manifestations. The cellular allergen stimulation test (CAST) is used in diagnosis of allergic and pseudoallergic reactions. This assay is based on the determination of sulfidoleukotrienes, which are produced by allergen-stimulated basophils in vitro. The potential role of CAST in diagnosis of ABPA was evaluated in this study. The CAST assay was applied in 27 CF-patients including eight subjects with positive clinical and serological signs of ABPA. Additional to the Nelson-criteria for diagnosis of ABPA specific IgE against recombinant Aspergillus antigens (rAsp f 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6) were assessed. The CAST results were positive in all ABPA-patients and in five controls without any sign of ABPA except positive specific IgE against Aspergillus fumigatus (sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 74%). Specific IgE against rAsp f 4 and/or f 6 were positive in six of the eight ABPA-patients, but not in the controls. Positive CAST results, total serum IgE > 500 U/ml and positive IgE antibodies against rAsp f 4 and/or f 6 were only found in ABPA-patients (specificity of 100%). The CAST assay on its own includes high sensitivity with lower specificity. For the discrimination of ABPA from sensitization to Aspergillus, the CAST, the highly elevated total serum IgE and rAsp in combination are potential auxiliary diagnostic parameters.",2007,17335008,no
[The value of serum galactomannan antigen for detection of invasive aspergillosis in hematological patients].,"The incidence of invasive aspergillosis (IA) is increasing in patients with hematological disorders and it may lead to a high mortality rate. This study was to evaluate serum aspergillus galactomannan (GM) antigen assay as a potential early diagnosis and follow-up of IA.From October 2004 to October 2005, 302 blood samples were obtained from 81 neutropenic hematological patients with fever over 38.5 degrees C and shown to have no response to broad-spectrum antibiotics treatment. Blood samples were collected twice a week. The detection of aspergillus GM antigen was carried out with a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a GM positivity was defined as A index > 1.5 in two consecutive mensuration. Furthermore, the patients with positive GM test received preemptive antifungal therapy with amphotericin B or itraconazole.Twenty seven patients (33.0%) were considered GM test positive from a total of 81 cases and 11 patients were diagnosed as proven or probable IA. The GM test correctly identified 7 of the 11 patients who had aspergillus antigen (63.6% sensitivity). When 14 patients without signs or symptoms of invasive fungal infection (IFI) were tested, the test correctly identified 12 of the 14 (85.7% specificity) as not having the antigen. GM positivity allowed also the anticipation of IA diagnosis (from 3 to 30 days before mycological culture). 19 of 27 GM test positive patients were given preemptive anti aspergillus therapy and there was a good response in 12 patients but no response in 7 cases with 36.8% mortality. After treatment, GM antigen decreased to normal with a good response. Otherwise, an elevated value hinted a unsatisfactory result as judged with Wilcoxon signed rank test (P < 0.0005).It is suggested that serum GM antigen detection may be a useful test for early diagnosis of IA and GM test-based preemptive antifungal therapy in hematological patients at high risk can decrease mortality of IA substantively. Moreover, the dynamic change of GM test value can be useful for assessing therapeutic response.",2007,17326997,yes
Interleukin-10 promoter polymorphism as risk factor to develop invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.,"This present study was undertaken to examine the role of the host response to Aspergillus fumigatus in the development of clinical symptoms of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). The natural outcome and response to IPA infection varies between individuals. Whereas some variation may be attributable to fungi and environmental variables, it is probable that host genetic background also plays a significant role. Interleukin (IL)-10 has a key function in the regulation of cellular immune responses and is involved in various inflammatory diseases. IL-10 promoter carries a polymorphism that has been associated to production levels. Our aim was to investigate the role of this polymorphism in susceptibility to develop IPA infection. The study included 120 haematological patients and 124 age and sex-matched controls and bi-allelic IL-10 -1082(G/A) polymorphism was examined. Genotypic (p=0.385) and allelic frequencies (p=0.527, OR=0.89, 95% CI=0.78-1.60) were similar between patients and healthy controls. IPA was diagnosed in 59 of the 120 patients according to consensus criteria published by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group (EORTC/IFICG). Our results provide evidence that IL-10 -1082(AA) genotype is associated with resistance to develop IPA (p=0.001). Allele frequency of IL-10 -1082A allele was weakly associated with susceptibility to develop IPA infection (p=0.052). In conclusion, these results suggest that differential production of IL-10 may alter the risk for IPA in haematological patients.",2007,17321603,no
Visual loss in the setting of allergic fungal sinusitis: pathophysiology and outcome.,"To hypothesise the probable pathophysiological mechanism responsible for visual loss in allergic fungal sinusitis, other than direct compression.Retrospective, non-randomised case series. Out of 274 cases of allergic fungal sinusitis, four cases with sudden visual loss were enrolled into the study. The fourth case had visual loss on the contralateral side to bony erosion of the lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus.All four cases were evaluated with fungal smear, immunoglobulin (Ig) E titres, visual evoked potentials, non-contrast computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the paranasal sinuses, and fundus examination. They then underwent endoscopic sinus debridement followed by intravenous methylprednisolone.Improvement in vision.All four cases experienced an improvement in vision: full recovery in three cases and partial improvement in one case.In view of the operative, radiological and laboratory findings for case four, with the suggestion of a hyperimmune response to fungal antigens (in the form of raised IgE titre and positive fungal serology), we suggest that a local immunological reaction to fungal antigens might be responsible for the observed visual loss in cases of allergic fungal sinusitis, in addition to mechanical compression of the optic nerve.",2007,17319994,no
"Health evaluation of free-ranging and captive blue-fronted Amazon parrots (Amazona aestiva) in the Gran chaco, Bolivia.","Bolivia has a total of 47 species of Psittacidae, seven of which have been identified in our study site, the semiarid Gran Chaco of the Isoso. One species, the blue-fronted parrot (Amazona aestiva), is frequently captured by local Isoseño Guaraní Indians for exploitation on the national and international market. These birds are often temporarily housed in small villages under unhygienic conditions with poultry and other domestic species. On occasion, these parrots escape back to the wild. Additionally, many of these birds are kept as pets or are used to lure wild. parrots within slingshot range for subsequent capture. In this study, we evaluated the health status, including the level of exposure to selected infectious agents, in the wild-caught captive birds and free-ranging birds. Physical examinations were performed, and blood was collected, from 54 live birds (20 captive and 34 free-ranging). Feces were collected from 15 birds (seven captive and eight free-ranging). Necropsies were also performed on four recently dead wild-caught birds. On serologic testing, no birds were found to have antibodies to avian influenza virus, Chlamydophila psittaci, infectious bronchitis virus, infectious bursal disease virus, infectious laryngotracheitis virus, Marek's disease virus, paramyxovirus-1, paramyxovirus-2, paramyxovirus-3, polyomavirus, eastern equine encephalitis virus, western equine encephalitis virus, or Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus. Positive antibody titers were found for psittacine herpesvirus (8/44, 18.2%), Aspergillus spp. (3/51, 5.9%), and Salmonella pullorum (33/49, 67.3%). All three of the birds that tested antibody positive for Aspergillus spp. were captive, whereas six of the eight and 15 of the 33 birds that tested positive for psittacine herpesvirus and S. pullorum, respectively, were wild.",2007,17312715,no
Allergen motifs and the prediction of allergenicity.,"We have recently shown that the majority of allergens can be represented by allergen motifs. This observation prompted us to experimentally investigate the synthesized peptides corresponding to the in silico motifs with regard to potential IgE binding and cross-reactions with allergens. Two motifs were selected as examples to conduct in vitro studies. From the first motif, derived from allergenic MnSOD sequences, the motif stretch of the allergen Asp f 6 was selected and synthesized as a peptide (MnSOD Mot). The corresponding full-length MnSOD was also expressed in Escherichia coli and both were compared for IgE reactivity with sera of patients reacting to the MnSOD of Aspergillus fumigatus or Malassezia sympodialis. For the second motif, the invertebrate tropomyosin sequences were aligned and a motif consensus sequence was expressed as a recombinant protein (Trop Mot). The IgE reactivity of Trop Mot was analyzed in ELISA and compared to that of recombinant tropomyosin from the shrimp Penaeus aztecus (rPen a 1) in ImmunoCAP. MnSOD Mot was weakly recognized by some of the tested sera, suggesting that the IgE binding epitopes of a multimeric globular protein such as MnSOD cannot be fully represented by a motif peptide. In contrast, the motif Trop Mot showed the same IgE reactivity as shrimp full-length tropomyosin, indicating that the major allergenic reactivity of a repetitive structure such as tropomyosin can be covered by a motif peptide. Our results suggest that the motif-generating algorithm may be used for identifying major IgE binding structures of coiled-coil proteins.",2007,17303251,no
Galactomannan antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,"Invasive aspergillosis is difficult to diagnose in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In 2003, a serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for the detection of galactomannan (a glycoprotein found on the Aspergillus cell wall) became available in the United States. In 2004, patients undergoing HSCT were screened biweekly with the galactomannan ELISA at our institution. We performed a retrospective chart review of 121 SCT patients who underwent galactomannan testing. Thirteen of the patients (10.7%) had at least 1 positive galactomannan ELISA, and 4 had multiple positive tests. When calculated in reference to a proved or probable diagnosis of aspergillosis, the galactomannan ELISA had a sensitivity of 0.50 and a specificity of 0.94. The positive predictive value was 0.46, and the negative predictive value was 0.94. Galactomannan ELISA had fewer false-positive and false-negative results in pediatric patients than in adult patients. In 4 of the 12 cases of invasive aspergillosis, the galactomannan ELISA was positive before other microbiologic evidence of aspergillosis was available. In these cases, a positive ELISA predated culture and cytologic evidence of invasive aspergillosis by a mean of 5 days (range, 1-8 days). Our findings indicate that a biweekly serum galactomannan ELISA is a highly specific diagnostic tool for detecting invasive aspergillosis in patients undergoing HSCT. When used regularly, the ELISA may allow for earlier diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in some patients. The test is troubled by a low sensitivity and high frequency of false-negative tests.",2007,17287156,yes
The mycobiota and toxicity of equine feeds.,"Feed contamination can lead to nutrient losses and detrimental effects on animal health and production. The purposes of this study were to investigate the mycobiota in equine mixed feeds and to determine natural contamination with aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and fumonisin B1 (FB1). Fungal enumeration of equine feed samples was done. A commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit was applied to quantify AFB1 and FB1. A comparison between ELISA and HPLC was carried out. Feed mould counts ranged from <1 x 10(2) to 1 x 10(5) cfu/g. The most frequent genus isolated was Aspergillus (40.54%), followed by Penicillium (18.38%) and Fusarium (16.22%). The most prevalent Aspergillus sp. was A. flavus (36%). AFB1 values ranged between 0.01 and 99.4 microg/kg. FB(1) levels ranged between 0.01 and 7.49 microg/kg. HPLC and ELISA methods showed positive correlation for AFB1 and FB1 determinations (r = 0.9851 and r = 0.9791, respectively). The ELISA analytical method was efficient for AFB1 and FB1 detection. The scarcity of studies on natural fungal contamination and on the presence of AFB1 and FB1 in materials used as equine feed ingredients highlights the value and contribution of this study.",2007,17285246,no

Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with decompensated cirrhosis: case series.,"Opportunistic invasive fungal infections are increasingly frequent in intensive care patients. Their clinical spectrum goes beyond the patients with malignancies, and for example invasive pulmonary aspergillosis has recently been described in critically ill patients without such condition. Liver failure has been suspected to be a risk factor for aspergillosis.We describe three cases of adult respiratory distress syndrome with sepsis, shock and multiple organ failure in patients with severe liver failure among whom two had positive Aspergillus antigenemia and one had a positive Aspergillus serology. In all cases bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was positive for Aspergillus fumigatus.

Development and evaluation of an ELISA for quantification of human alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor in complex biological mixtures.,"Human alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor(1) (alpha(1)-PI) is the most abundant serine protease inhibitor in plasma. Its major function is inhibition of neutrophil elastase in lungs. alpha(1)-PI deficiency may result in severe, ultimately fatal emphysema. Three plasma-derived (pd-) alpha(1)-PI products are licensed in the US for replacement therapy of deficient patients. The recombinant versions (r-alpha(1)-PI), proposed as alternatives to pd-alpha(1)-PI products, have been under intensive investigation. For accurate determination of alpha(1)-PI from different sources and in various forms, there is an obvious need for reliable standardized assays for alpha(1)-PI quantification and potency measurements. As a part of our multi-step research focused on alpha(1)-PI structure-function investigation, we have established a simple and reproducible double-sandwich ELISA based on commercially available polyclonal antibodies. The developed ELISA allows the quantification of both pd-alpha(1)-PI and r-alpha(1)-PI in various complex matrices. A validation of the ELISA was performed with the working range of the assay (3.1-50 ng/ml) established on the bases of the following parameters: linearity (3-100 ng/ml, r(2)=0.995) accuracy (87.3-114.6% recovery)",2007,17257853,no
Development of novel real-time PCR assays for detection and differentiation of eleven medically important Aspergillus and Candida species in clinical specimens.,"In the present study, novel real-time PCR assays targeting the fungal ITS2 region were developed for the detection and differentiation of medically important Aspergillus species (Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus terreus) and Candida species (Candida albicans, Candida dubliniensis, Candida glabrata, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis, and Candida tropicalis) using a LightCycler instrument. The combination of a group-specific and a universal primer with five Aspergillus or six Candida species-specific biprobes in one reaction mixture facilitated rapid screening and species differentiation by the characteristic peak melting temperatures of the biprobes. Both assays can be performed either as single assays or simultaneously in the same LightCycler run. The analytical sensitivity using pure cultures and EDTA-anticoagulated blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and tissue samples spiked with A. fumigatus and C. albicans cell suspensions was shown to be at least 1 CFU per PCR, corresponding to 5 to 10 CFU/ml blood and 10 CFU/200 microl CSF or 0.02 g tissue. To assess the clinical applicability, 26 respiratory samples, 4 tissue samples from the maxillary sinus, and 1 blood sample were retrospectively tested and real-time PCR results were compared with results from culture, histology, or a galactomannan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Twenty samples (64.5%) were both culture positive and positive by real-time PCR. Six samples (19.4%) showed no growth of fungi but were positive by real-time PCR. However, all of the tissue samples were positive by both PCR and histology. The blood sample showed no growth of Aspergillus, but aspergillosis was confirmed by positive galactomannan ELISA, histology, and PCR results. The remaining samples (16.1%) were culture and PCR negative also, no other signs indicating fungal infection were observed. Our data suggest that the Aspergillus and Candida assays may be appropriate for use in clinical laboratories as simple and rapid screening tests for the most frequently encountered Aspergillus and Candida species and might become an important tool in the early diagnosis of fungal infections in the future.",2007,17251398,no
The 160 N-terminal residues of calnexin define a novel region supporting viability in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.,"Protein secretion is a complex process that can be modulated by folding factors in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), such as calnexin, a highly-conserved molecular chaperone involved in quality control. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, calnexin (Cnx1p) is essential for cell viability. The calnexin/Cnx1p determinants required for viability have been mapped within the last 123 residues of its C-terminus. To better understand the role(s) of calnexin/Cnx1p in secretion, we screened for cnx1 mutants 'super-secreting' cellulase. We identified ss14_cnx1, a mutant secreting 10-fold higher levels of the glycoprotein cellulase than the wild-type strain. While cellulase did not interact with ss14_Cnx1p, the ratio of secreted activity/quantity for this enzyme was not affected, suggesting that the quality control of folding in the ER was adequate in the mutant strain. Surprisingly, the ss14_Cnx1p mutant is composed of the 160 N-terminal amino acids of the mature molecule, thus this mutant defines a novel calnexin/Cnx1p region supporting Sz. pombe viability. Interestingly, like viable mutants spanning the last 52 aa of calnexin/Cnx1p, the 160 N-terminal residues encoded by ss14_cnx1 also forms a complex with the essential BiP chaperone. These results reveal the so far unidentified importance of the N-terminal region of calnexin/Cnx1p.",2007,17230581,no
A new competitive fluorescence assay for the detection of patulin toxin.,"Patulin is a toxic secondary metabolite of a number of fungal species belonging to the genera Penicillum and Aspergillus. It has been mainly isolated from apples and apple products contaminated with the common storage-rot fungus of apples, Penicillum expansum, but it has also been extracted from rotten fruits, moldy feeds, and stored cheese. Human exposure to patulin can lead to serious health problems, and according to a long-term investigation in rats, the World Health Organization has set a tolerable weekly intake of 7 ppb body weight. The content of patulin in foods has been restricted to 50 ppb in many countries. Conventional analytical detection methods involve chromatographic analyses, such as HPLC, GC, and, more recently, techniques such as LC/MS and GC/MS. However, extensive protocols of sample cleanup are required prior to the analysis, and to accomplish it, expensive analytical instrumentation is necessary. An immunochemical analytical method, based on highly specific antigen-antibody interactions, would be desirable, offering several advantages compared to conventional techniques, i.e., low cost per sample, high selectivity, high sensitivity, and high throughput. In this paper, the synthesis of two new derivatives of patulin is described, along with their conjugation to the bovine serum albumin for the production of polyclonal antibodies. Finally, a fluorescence competitive immunoassay was developed for the on-line detection of patulin.",2007,17222046,no
Use of mycelial-phase Sporothrix schenckii exoantigens in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for diagnosis of sporotrichosis by antibody detection.,"An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for specific antibody detection in serum specimens of patients with sporotrichosis. The assay was made with mycelial-phase Sporothrix schenckii exoantigens and was tested against 90 sera from patients with different clinical forms of sporotrichosis. Potential cross-reactions were analyzed with 72 heterologous sera from patients with paracoccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, aspergillosis, histoplasmosis, tuberculosis, and American tegumentary leishmaniasis, as well as 76 sera from healthy controls. We found a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 89% in this assay. Some cross-reactions were seen, as observed in other immunoassays for the diagnosis of sporotrichosis. The ELISA appears to be especially useful for cutaneous forms of disease, since these are not promptly diagnosed with available immunoprecipitation or agglutination techniques. These results suggest that the ELISA using mycelial-phase S. schenckii exoantigens is a very sensitive diagnostic tool for the serodiagnosis of sporotrichosis and can be used in conjunction with conventional methods of diagnosis, particularly in cases where cross-reactions or false-positive results are experienced with the serodiagnosis.",2007,17215334,no

The authors evaluated the performance of the GM EIA for the diagnosis and monitoring of the course of IA in KCMH.The authors prospectively performed the study from June 2002 to January 2004 in a consecutive series of adult neutropenic patients with hematological disorders who were at risk for developing IA. During hospitalization, serum galactomannan levels were measured once or twice weekly using the Platellia Aspergillus EIA test kit. The sensitivity and specificity of the GM EIA were calculated according to the proportion of patients with true and false positive and negative tests.There were 50 treatment episodes in 44 patients with 5 proven, 12 probable, and 33 possible or no IA. The cutoff GM index of > 0.75 was determined with a sensitivity of 94.1% and a specificity of 78.8%. There was a close relationship between clinical outcome and the kinetics of GM indices.The GM EIA is a useful diagnostic toolfor the diagnosis and monitoring of the course oflA in the presented institute.",2007,17205865,yes
"[Short communication: prevalence of fungal allergy in patients applied to hospital with symptoms of atopic disease in Kocaeli, Turkey].","The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of fungal sensitization and to detect the IgE and eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) levels in the positive cases inhabiting in Kocaeli province (located in Northwest region of Turkey). The results of mixed fungus tests of 1.799 patients (870 male, 929 female) ages between 3-80 years old who were admitted to Kocaeli University Medical Faculty Hospital in the period of January 2002-January 2005, with the symptoms of atopic disease such as upper/lower respiratory tract symptoms, asthma and/or rhinitis and/or eczema, were evaluated retrospectively. Serum IgE and ECP levels of all cases were determined by a commercial enzyme immunoassay (UniCAP System, Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) method. The allergy test performed by using mixed fungal panel (Penicillium notatum, Cladosporium herbarum, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, Alternaria alternata, Helminthosporium halodes) was found positive in 68 cases (3.8%). Of those cases 7 (10.2%) were found to be sensitized to Alternaria alternata, 8 (11.7%) to Aspergillus fumigatus, 10 (14.7%) to Penicillium notatum, and 6 (8.8%) were sensitized to more than one fungus. The mean IgE (106.2+/-166.1) and ECP levels (31.7+/-18.3) of fungus sensitized cases were found significantly higher than the non-sensitized subjects (IgE 77.8+/-95.0, ECP",2007,17205697,no
Pathogenesis of Aspergillus fumigatus and the kinetics of galactomannan in an in vitro model of early invasive pulmonary aspergillosis: implications for antifungal therapy.,"Little is known about the pathogenesis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and the relationship between the kinetics of diagnostic markers and the outcome of antifungal therapy.An in vitro model of the human alveolus, consisting of a bilayer of human alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells, was developed. An Aspergillus fumigatus strain expressing green fluorescent protein was used. Invasion of the cell bilayer was studied using confocal and electron microscopy. The kinetics of culture, polymerase chain reaction, and galactomannan were determined. Galactomannan was used to measure the antifungal effect of macrophages and amphotericin B. A mathematical model was developed, and results were bridged to humans.A. fumigatus penetrated the cellular bilayer 14-16 h after inoculation. Galactomannan levels were inextricably tied to fungal invasion and were a robust measure of the antifungal effect of macrophages and amphotericin B. Neither amphotericin nor macrophages alone was able to suppress the growth of A. fumigatus rather, the combination was required. Monte Carlo simulations showed that human dosages of amphotericin B of at least 0.6 mg/kg were required to achieve adequate drug exposure.This model provides a strategy by which relationships among pathogenesis, immunological effectors, and antifungal drug therapy for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis may be further understood.",2007,17205486,no
Prevention and early treatment of invasive fungal infection in patients with cancer and neutropenia and in stem cell transplant recipients in the era of newer broad-spectrum antifungal agents and diagnostic adjuncts.,"Invasive fungal infection (IFI) is a leading cause of infection-related mortality among patients with cancer and prolonged neutropenia and among allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with graft-versus-host disease. Invasive candidiasis was the principal IFI in the period predating fluconazole prophylaxis, whereas today, invasive aspergillosis and other mold infections cause the majority of deaths from fungal infection in this patient population. The changing epidemiology of IFI, in addition to advances made in antifungal therapeutics and early diagnosis of IFI, warrant a reevaluation of earlier strategies aimed at prevention and early treatment of IFI that were developed several years ago. Here, we propose that persistent neutropenic fever is nonspecific for an IFI and should not be used as the sole criterion for empirical modification in the antifungal regimen in a patient receiving mold-active prophylaxis. We explore the potential benefits and gaps in knowledge associated with employing chest CT scans and laboratory markers as diagnostic adjuncts for IFI. Finally, we discuss the implications of newer antifungal agents and diagnostic adjuncts in the design of future clinical trials to evaluate prophylaxis and early prevention strategies.",2007,17205448,no
Surfactant protein d expression in chronic rhinosinusitis patients and immune responses in vitro to Aspergillus and alternaria in a nasal explant model.,"Common fungi have been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with eosinophilic mucus (EMCRS). Surfactant protein (SP)-D plays an important role in the immune response to Aspergillus fumigatus in the lungs. We sought to determine whether SP-D is expressed in nasal mucosa and investigated the response of SP-D in vitro to fungal allergens.1) Nasal biopsies from 59 CRS and EMCRS patients, stratified into allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS), nonallergic fungal eosinophilic sinusitis (NAFES), and nonallergic nonfungal eosinophilic sinusitis (NANFES) were studied by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunostaining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 2) Nasal tissue from three CRS and three NANFES patients was cultured with fungal allergens in a nasal explant in vitro model for 24 hours at increasing concentrations and mRNA SP-D secreted SP-D protein levels in response to the fungi determined by qRT-PCR and ELISA.Staining for SP-D was detected in the submucosal glands from the nasal biopsies in all patient groups except for AFS. By ELISA, SP-D was undetectable in AFS and decreased in NAFES, NANFES, and CRS compared with controls. CRS patients in vitro cultured with Aspergillus and Alternaria allergens in a nasal tissue explant model induced up-regulation of SP-D by qRT-PCR. In contrast, NANFES nasal tissue explants cultured with Aspergillus allergens induced down-regulation of SP-D.We report for the first time the expression of SP-D in both diseased and normal nasal mucosa. SP-D expression in CRS patients is up-regulated by fungal allergens in an in vitro model. These results may provide potential novel therapy for treatment of CRS.",2007,17202930,no
A pilot study on the infiltrating cells and cytokine levels in the tear of fungal keratitis patients.,"To determine the cellular profile and cytokine levels in the tear fluid of fungal keratitis patients.Tear samples were collected from six fungal keratitis patients (Group I) from active stages of the disease up to resolution. Tears collected from the following served as controls: uninfected fellow eye (Group II A) of Group I, patients undergoing cataract surgery (Group II B) and acute conjunctivitis (Group II C). The cellular profile was evaluated. Interleukines (IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1beta) were estimated using sandwich enzyme immunoassay. Statistical analysis was carried out using nonparametric two-sample median test.Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were the predominant infiltrating cells in Group I. During the initial stages of fungal infection, levels of IL-6 and IL-8 in the tear samples were found to be significantly increased when compared with Group II A (P=0.019 for IL-6, P<0.001 for IL-8). This was also true for IL -8 (P=0.008) levels in Group I and Group II B). While IL-6 levels decreased significantly towards healing, IL-8 remained slightly elevated even after healing. These cytokines were at the base level in Group II A. Lymphocytes and PMN were present in equal proportions in Group II C, which showed elevated levels of cytokines but not to the extent of Group I.This horizontal study indicates that understanding the nature of the inflammatory response in the tears of fungal keratitis patients is of considerable interest and warrants further investigations.",2006,17189883,no
Galactomannan antigen detection in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.,"Invasive aspergillosis is a serious and lethal infection among immunocompromised patients, with reported mortality rates as high as 74-92%. The high mortality is related to the severe immunosuppression experienced by these patients as well as the difficulties for physicians in arriving at a timely diagnosis. Definitive diagnostic procedures (tissue biopsy for histopathology and culture) are often precluded by severe cytopenias and coagulation abnormalities. The development of minimally invasive, nonculture diagnostic methods is a major advance in the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. Galactomannan is a heteropolysaccharide (mannan core and side residues of galactofuranosyl units) present in the cell wall of Aspergillus spp. The double sandwich enzyme immunoassay, which detects galactomannan in serum samples, has been available in Europe for almost a decade and in the USA since May 2003, for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. However, availability of the double galactomannan enzyme immunoassay is center variable in the USA and, although its analytical performance in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis is well documented, its routine use in clinical practice is limited. As an adjunct in the diagnosis and management of invasive aspergillosis, incorporation of the galactomannan enzyme immunoassay into clinical trials will help to further define its role.",2006,17187481,no
Two non-invasive diagnostic tools for invasive aspergilosis: (1-3)-beta-D-glucan and the galactomannan assay.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a serious cause of morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised patients. Prompt and non-invasive methods for diagnosing IA are needed to improve the management of this life-threatening infection in patients with hematological disorders. In summary, this retrospective review of studies performed on the two assays finds that both assays have high sensitivity and specificity but are more useful when used together as a diagnostic strategy for patients with invasive aspergillosis.",2006,17181127,no
Expression of immunomodulatory genes in human monocytes induced by voriconazole in the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"We assessed the effect of voriconazole (VRC) on the expression and release of selected cytokines and chemokines in the THP-1 human monocytic cell line in response to Aspergillus fumigatus hyphal fragments (HF) by cDNA microarray analysis, reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Stimulation of THP-1 cells by HF alone caused a significant up-regulation of CCL4 (MIP1B) and CCL16, while CCL2 (MCP1) was down-regulated. By comparison, in the presence of VRC, a large number of genes such as CCL3 (MIP1A), CCL4 (MIP1B), CCL5 (RANTES), CCL7 (MCP3), CCL11 (EOTAXIN), CCL15 (MIP1Delta), CXCL6, and CXCL13 were strongly up-regulated in THP-1 cells challenged by HF, whereas CCL20 (MIP3A) and CCL21 (MIP2) were down-regulated. Among five genes differentially expressed in THP-1 cells, IL12A, IL12B, and IL-16 were down-regulated whereas IL-11 and TGFB1 were significantly up-regulated in the presence of VRC. The inflammation-related genes IFNgamma, IL1R1, and TNFA were also up-regulated in THP-1 cells exposed to HF only in the presence of VRC. RT-PCR of four selected genes validated the results of microarrays. The release of interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and IL-12 was significantly increased from monocytes stimulated either by HF alone (P < 0.05) or in the presence of VRC (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). In contrast, tumor necrosis factor alpha release from monocytes was enhanced only in the presence of VRC (P < 0.01). The chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta were decreased under both conditions (P < 0.01). These results demonstrate that in the presence of VRC, HF induces a more pronounced profile of gene expression in THP-1 cells than HF alone, potentially leading to more-efficient host resistance to A. fumigatus.",2006,17178797,no
Alternaria alternata NADP-dependent mannitol dehydrogenase is an important fungal allergen.,"Alternaria alternata is one of the most important allergenic fungi worldwide. Mannitol dehydrogenase (MtDH) has previously been shown to be a major allergen of Cladosporium herbarum and cross-reactivity has been demonstrated for several fungal allergens.The present study's objective was to clone the MtDH from an A. alternata cDNA library, express and purify the recombinant non-fusion protein and test its IgE-binding properties. Methods A cDNA library prepared from A. alternata hyphae and spores was screened for mannitol dehydrogenase by DNA hybridization with the radioactively labelled C. herbarum homologue as a probe. The resulting clone was sequenced and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli as a recombinant non-fusion protein, which was purified to homogeneity and analysed for its IgE-binding capacity.The coding sequence of the full-length cDNA clone comprises 798 bp encoding a protein with a molecular mass of 28.6 kDa and a predicted pI of 5.88. Protein sequence analysis revealed an identity of 75% and a homology of 86% between the MtDHs of A. alternata and C. herbarum. The functional mannitol dehydrogenase was expressed in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) transformed with the vector pMW172 and purified to homogeneity. The enzyme catalyses the NADPH-dependent conversion of d-fructose to d-mannitol. In IgE-ELISA and immunoblots, MtDH is recognized by 41% of A. alternata-allergic patients. In vivo immunoreactivity of the recombinant MtDH was verified by skin prick testing. Finally, inhibition-ELISA experiments confirmed cross-reactivity between the MtDHs of A. alternata and C. herbarum.Mannitol dehydrogenase (Alt a 8) represents an important new allergen of the ascomycete A. alternata that might be suitable for improving diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.",2006,17177674,no
"Cerebral aspergillosis diagnosed by detection of Aspergillus flavus-specific DNA, galactomannan and (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan in clinical specimens.","A case of cerebral aspergillosis was diagnosed by the detection of Aspergillus flavus-specific DNA in brain biopsy and serum specimens. The diagnosis was also supported by detection of elevated levels of galactomannan and (1-->3)-beta-d-glucan in serum specimens. Despite the presence of dichotomously branched septate hyphae in brain biopsy, the culture remained negative. The inability to isolate the organism in culture suggested that combined therapy of AmBisome and caspofungin was fungicidal for the fungus in the brain abscess.",2006,17172527,no
Incidence of aflatoxins in Iran pistachio nuts.,"Aflatoxins (AF) are highly toxic and carcinogenic secondary fungal metabolites and have been detected in various food commodities including pistachio nuts. Pistachio nuts were produced in Iran during March 2002-February 2003 analyzed for aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), aflatoxin B2 (AFB2), aflatoxin G1 (AFG1) and aflatoxin G2 (AFG2) using immunoaffinity column and quantitated by HPLC and/or TLC-scanner. In this regard, 3356 pistachio nut samples were collected. After dividing samples to sub-samples, 10,068 AF analyses were done. Among 10,068 samples analyzed, AFB1 was detected in 3699 samples (36.7% of the total) with the mean and median of 5.9 (+/-41.7) ng/g and 0.1 ng/g, respectively. Total AF (AFT) was detected in 2852 samples (28.3% of the total) with the mean and median of 7.3 (+/-53.2)ng/g and 0.4 ng/g, respectively. AFB1 level in 1191 samples (11.8%) was above the maximum tolerated level (MTL) of AFB1 in pistachio nut in Iran (5 ng/g). Regarding AFT, the mean contamination level (7.3 ng/g) was lower than MTL of AFT in pistachio nut in Iran as well as lower than the proposed draft maximum level of Codex Committee on Food Additives and Contaminants for AFT (15 ng/g), and only 7.5% of samples had levels above the MTL.",2006,17161513,no
Filtration-based tyramide amplification technique--a new simple approach for rapid detection of aflatoxin B1.,"The catalyzed reporter deposition (CARD) method of signal amplification, also called ""tyramide signal amplification"", has been used in immunoassays not only to increase sensitivity but also to reduce assay time. The current approach to tyramide amplification in immunoassays involves slow incubation with agitation. In this paper we describe new filtration-based tyramide amplification and substrate visualization techniques. Compared with the standard method, this new approach greatly enhances spot intensities in membrane immunoassay and reduces biotinylated tyramide (B-T) and substrate consumption approximately fiftyfold, without loss of specificity. An improved test device and a cost-effective method for preparation of membranes for Super-CARD amplification have also been developed. The techniques have been used for rapid detection of aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)) in a variety of foodstuffs with a detection limit of 12.5 microg kg(-1). The assay procedure involves sequential addition of standards or sample, AFB(1)-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate, B-T, avidin-HRP, and substrate solution over anti-AFB(1) antibody-spotted zones of the membrane surface. The method saves time, improves reproducibility, eliminates many washing steps and avoids manipulation of the membranes between the different steps, while maintaining the sensitivity of the standard method. Average recoveries from different non-infected food samples spiked with AFB(1) at concentrations from 25 to 100 mg kg(-1) were between 95 and 105%. AFB(1) results obtained on different days for Aspergillus parasiticus infection of corn and groundnut samples correlated well with estimates obtained by HPLC.",2006,17151856,no
"Cloning and functional expression of the gene encoding an inhibitor against Aspergillus flavus alpha-amylase, a novel seed lectin from Lablab purpureus (Dolichos lablab).","Maize is one of the more important agricultural crops in the world and, under certain conditions, prone to attack from pathogenic fungi. One of these, Aspergillus flavus, produces toxic and carcinogenic metabolites, called aflatoxins, as byproducts of its infection of maize kernels. The alpha-amylase of A. flavus is known to promote aflatoxin production in the endosperm of these infected kernels, and a 36-kDa protein from the Lablab purpureus, denoted AILP, has been shown to inhibit alpha-amylase production and the growth of A. flavus. Here, we report the isolation of six full-length labAI genes encoding AILP and a detailed analysis of the activities of the encoded proteins. Each of the six labAI genes encoded sequences of 274 amino acids, with the deduced amino acid sequences showing approximately 95-99% identity. The sequences are similar to those of lectin members of a legume lectin-arcelin-alpha-amylase inhibitor family reported to function in plant resistance to insect pests. The labAI genes did not show any of the structures characteristic of conserved structures identified in alpha-amylase inhibitors to date. The recombinant proteins of labAI-1 and labAI-2 agglutinated human red blood cells and inhibited A. flavus alpha-amylase in a manner similar to that shown by AILP. These data indicate that labAI genes are a new class of lectin members in legume seeds and that their proteins have both lectin and alpha-amylase inhibitor activity. These results are a valuable contribution to our knowledge of plant-pathogen interactions and will be applicable for developing protocols aimed at controlling A. flavus infection.",2006,17149640,no
Evaluation of pan-fungal PCR assay and Aspergillus antigen detection in the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections in high risk paediatric cancer patients.,"Profound and prolonged neutropenia following chemotherapy is a major risk factor for systemic fungal infection. As the early diagnosis of invasive fungal infection (IFI) is difficult, these infections are still associated with high morbidity and mortality. Recently, Pan-fungal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been a promising aid in rapid, early diagnosis of IFI. During the past few years, increasing numbers of suspected IFIs were encountered at our institution in patients with prolonged neutropenia after intensified immunosuppressive chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic utility of both the aspergillus galactomannan (GM) antigen and the pan-fungal PCR assay in the diagnosis of IFI in high risk febrile neutropenic paediatric cancer patients. During one year period, 91 febrile neutropenic (FN) paediatric cases at high risk for developing IFI while receiving chemotherapy were investigated at National Cancer Institute, Egypt. These patients were subjected to clinical evaluation, chest CT scan, conventional blood cultures for bacterial and fungal pathogens, aspergillus GM antigen detection and PCR assay utilizing pan-fungal primers. Of the 91 FN episodes, 15 were proven IFI whereas 27 cases were either probable (n=13) or possible IFI (n=14), and 49 were unlikely to be IFI episodes. Based on positive results for proven/probable IFI and compared to culture results, Pan-fungal PCR showed sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 75%, 92%, 84% and 87%",2006,17127630,no
Differential physiological and developmental expression of the UapA and AzgA purine transporters in Aspergillus nidulans.,"In this article we study the cellular expression of UapA and AzgA, the two major purine transporters of Aspergillus nidulans, by constructing strains expressing, from their native promoters, fully functional fluorescent (UapA-sGFP, AzgA-sGFP) or immunological (UapA-His) chimeric transporters. Epifluorescence microscopy and immunodetection showed that under different physiological conditions and during Aspergillus development: (i) UapA and AzgA expression in the plasma membrane becomes evident early during germination and remains at a significant basal level in mycelium, (ii) Neither of the two transporters is expressed in the stalk, the vesicle, the phialides and the conidiospores, but surprisingly, UapA is specifically and strongly expressed in the periphery of metulae, (iii) Both transporters are expressed in ascogenous hyphae and in hülle cells but not in cleistothecia or ascospores, (iv) Purine induction leads to approximately 4-fold increase in UapA and AzgA protein content in mycelium, compatible with an analogous increase at the transcriptional level, (v) Ammonium leads to removal of UapA, but not of AzgA, from the plasma membrane by sorting of the protein to the vacuole.",2006,17126042,no
"Exploration of members of Aspergillus sections Nigri, Flavi, and Terrei for feruloyl esterase production.","The ability of members of Aspergillus sections Nigri, Flavi, and Terrei to produce feruloyl esterases was studied according to their substrate specificity against synthetic methyl esters of hydroxycinnamic acids. Type A feruloyl esterases (FAEA), induced during growth on cereal-derived products, show a preference for the phenolic moiety of substrates that contain methoxy substitutions, as found in methyl sinapinate, whereas type B feruloyl esterases (FAEB) show a preference for the phenolic moiety of substrates that contain hydroxyl substitutions, as occurs in methyl caffeate. All the strains of Aspergillus section Nigri (e.g., A. niger and A. foetidus) were able to produce feruloyl esterases with activity profiles similar to those reported for FAEA and FAEB of A. niger when grown on oat-spelt xylan and sugar beet pulp, respectively. The two genes encoding these proteins, faeA and faeB, were identified by Southern blot analysis. The strains of Aspergillus sections Flavi (e.g., A. flavus, A. flavo-furcatus, and A. tamarii) and Terrei (e.g., A. terreus) were able to produce type A and type B enzymes. faeA was revealed in genomic DNA of these strains, and FAEA was determined by immunodetection in cultures grown in oat-spelt xylan. In addition, type B enzymes, not related to faeB, were efficiently induced by oat-spelt xylan and exhibited very original activity profiles on sugar beet pulp.

Induction of oxidative stress response by the mycotoxin patulin in mammalian cells.,"Patulin (PAT), a mycotoxin mainly produced by Penicillium and Aspergillus, is found in various foods and feeds. In the present study, its effects on oxidative stress in various mammalian cell lines were investigated. When cell-permeating fluorescent dyes were used as indicators of the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), we found that PAT treatment directly increased intracellular oxidative stress in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) and human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells. Lipid peroxidation levels were also significantly increased in HL-60 cells and mouse kidney homogenates treated with PAT. Suppression of CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression in mammalian cells by small interfering RNA resulted in an increase in PAT-mediated membrane damage, while overexpression of human CuZn-SOD or catalase led to a reduction in damage, indicating the involvement of ROS in PAT toxicity. Pretreatment of HEK293 cells with Tiron, a free radical scavenger, reduced the phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 elicited by PAT. The ERK1/2 signaling pathway inhibitor, U0126, also significantly decreased the levels of ROS associated with PAT treatment. These findings indicate that PAT treatment results in the ROS production in mammalian cells, and ROS partially contributes to PAT-induced cytotoxicity. Activation of ERK1/2 signaling pathway is correlated with PAT-mediated ROS.",2006,17090621,no
[Aspergillus fumigatus activate human corneal epithelial cells via Toll-like receptor 2 and 4].,"To determine Toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and TLR4 expression in human corneal epithelial tissue and cell line (THCE), and its activation by aspergillus fumigatus (AF) in inflammatory response.The expression of TLR2 and TLR4 protein in human corneal epithelial tissue and THCE was detected by Western blot and immunocytochemistry. THCE was challenged with AF mycelium fragment (5 x 10(6)/ml) and supernatant extract agent (equivalent to bovine serum albumin 10 microg/ml). IL-8 and TNF-alpha in THCE supernatant were detected by ELISA at 1, 2, 4 and 8 h post stimulation. The protein of IkappaBalpha in THCE cells was assayed by Western blot at 30 min, 1 h and 2 h after treatment. Antibody blocking test was utilized to evaluate the effect on IL-8 and TNF-alpha expression of THCE by blocking TLR2 and (or) TLR4 before challenge with AF agent.TLR2 and TLR4 protein were expressed in human corneal epithelial tissue and THCE. The IL-8 and TNF-alpha level in THCE supernatant was elevated at 1 h, increased to (64.71 +/- 5.15) pg/ml and (32.46 +/- 3.28) pg/ml (AF mycelium challenge group), (94.94 +/- 11.92) pg/ml and (48.70 +/- 3.32) pg/ml (AF supernatant challenge group) 8 h post-challenged, which was 3.0 times and 2.5 times, 4.5 times and 3.5 times to that of control group respectively (P < 0.01). The activity of IkappaBalpha in THCE cells was decreased to 10.31 +/- 1.30 (gray scale value) and 8.15 +/- 2.37 at 30 min after challenged with AF mycelium or supernatant extract agent compared to 51.57 +/- 5.58 and 49.23 +/- 3.49 of control group (P < 0.01), and was reverted at 2 h. The secretion of IL-8 and TNF-alpha was partly inhibited by blocking TLR2 or TLR4 (P < 0.05), obviously inhibited by blocking TLR2 and TLR4 (50% and 40% compared to that of control group) (P < 0.01) when challenged with AF mycelium. And that was markedly inhibited by blocking TLR4 or blocking TLR2 and TLR4 when challenged with AF supernatant (P < 0.01). The secretion of IL-8 and TNF-alpha was not inhibited by blocking TLR2 when challenged with AF supernatant (P > 0.05).AF agent may induce human corneal epithelial cells express inflammatory cytokines via TLR-NF-kappaB pathway.

Oxidized low-density lipoprotein-binding specificity of the Asp-hemolysin-related synthetic peptides from Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Oxidatively modified low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL) is present in atherosclerotic lesions and has been proposed to play an important role in atherogenesis. In the present study, in order to clarify the structure-binding activity relationship of Asp-hemolysin-related peptides to OxLDL, we investigated the interaction between Asp-hemolysin-related peptides consisting of 4 to 29 amino acid residues and OxLDL. The incubation of OxLDL with each Asp-hemolysin-related peptide resulted in the formation of an Asp-hemolysin/OxLDL complex. In particular, the tetrapeptide, YKDG (P-4), bound to OxLDL and inhibited the OxLDL-induced macrophage proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrated that lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) extracted from OxLDL inhibited the binding of P-21 to OxLDL in a dose-dependent manner and synthetic [14C]LysoPC bound to P-21. We propose here that the YKDG region is one of the important sites for the binding of these peptides to OxLDL, and LysoPC as a typical lipid moiety of OxLDL is attributed to the binding of OxLDL to these peptides.",2006,17077511,no
A two-stage cyclone using microcentrifuge tubes for personal bioaerosol sampling.,"Personal aerosol samplers are widely used to monitor human exposure to airborne materials. For bioaerosols, interest is growing in analyzing samples using molecular and immunological techniques. This paper presents a personal sampler that uses a two-stage cyclone to collect bioaerosols into disposable 1.5 ml Eppendorf-type microcentrifuge tubes. Samples can be processed in the tubes for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or immunoassays, and the use of multiple stages fractionates aerosol particles by aerodynamic diameter. The sampler was tested using fluorescent microspheres and aerosolized fungal spores. The sampler had first and second stage cut-off diameters of 2.6 microm and 1.6 microm at 2 l min(-1)(geometric standard deviation, GSD = 1.45 and 1.75), and 1.8 microm and 1 microm at 3.5 l min(-1)(GSD = 1.42 and 1.55). The sampler aspiration efficiency was >or=98% at both flow rates for particles with aerodynamic diameters of 3.1 microm or less. For 6.2 microm particles, the aspiration efficiency was 89% at 2 l min(-1) and 96% at 3.5 l min(-1). At 3.5 l min(-1), the sampler collected 92% of aerosolized Aspergillus versicolor and Penicillium chrysogenum spores inside the two microcentrifuge tubes, with less than 0.4% of the spores collecting on the back-up filter. The design and techniques given here are suitable for personal bioaerosol sampling, and could also be adapted to design larger aerosol samplers for longer-term atmospheric and indoor air quality sampling.",2006,17075620,no
Preemptive antifungal therapy: still a way to go.,"Early treatment of invasive mold infections improves the outcome. Therapy is often delayed, however, because available diagnostic tools such as culture, microscopy and conventional radiology lack sensitivity consequently, empirical initiation of antifungal therapy has been advocated, particularly for patients with prolonged unexplained neutropenic fever.Much recent progress has been made in the development and evaluation of nonculture-based assays, including the detection of the fungal antigens galactomannan and beta-D-glucan and the detection of fungal DNA by polymerase chain reaction techniques. These new tools should aid the rapid, early diagnosis of invasive fungal disease, especially when used as screening tools in conjunction with sensitive imaging techniques.The review will consider these recent developments with the purpose of introducing the concept of preemptive antifungal therapy.",2006,17075330,no
"Halogen immunoassay, a new method for the detection of sensitization to fungal allergens comparisons with conventional techniques.","Accurate diagnosis of allergy to specific fungal species is confounded by the variability in allergens occurring with different diagnostic systems. We compared the halogen immunoassay (HIA), which uses allergens expressed by freshly germinated spores that are bound to protein binding membranes (PBM), with the commercial Pharmacia UniCap assay (CAP) and with skin prick tests (SPT).Serum from 60 subjects was used 30 were SPT positive and sensitized to at least one of Alternaria alternata or Aspergillus fumigatus and the other 30 were SPT negative to these fungi but known to be sensitized to non-fungal allergens. All sera were analyzed by CAP against A. alternata, A. fumigatus, Cladosporium herbarum and Epicoccum purpurascens. For HIA, spores from reference cultures belonging to these four species were germinated on PBM, laminated and then probed with each serum. Two independent observers using an ordinal ranking system quantified the intensity and occurrence of the resultant immunoglobulin E (IgE) immunostained haloes around spores and this was statistically compared with the results of the two conventional immunodiagnostic techniques.Germinated conidia of each species expressed detectable allergen in the HIA. The agreement between the ordinal rank scores assigned by the pair of observers was very good (k >or= 0.8) and only differed for A. fumigatus (k = 0.66) . Between 3% and 7% of SPT negative sera was identified by HIA to have specific IgE towards A. fumigatus and A. alternata. For all four species tested there were strong correlations between HIA and CAP (P < 0.0001). However the correlation of both HIA and CAP to SPT was weaker for A. alternata (r(s) = 0.44, P < 0.0153) and absent for A. fumigatus.Overall, the HIA is a new immunodiagnostic technique for the detection of sensitization to fungal allergens that correlates significantly with CAP and to a lesser extent with SPT. This may be due to extract variability and system differences. The significance of this derives from the unique ability of the HIA to measure IgE antibodies to the undegraded allergens that are actively secreted by germinating conidia and hyphae. These are the natural agents of exposure to fungi, and as such, are most likely to be relevant to clinical disease.",2006,17075249,no
Successful early voriconazole treatment of Aspergillus infection in two non immunocompromised patients in Intensive Care Unit.,"We report two cases of respiratory Aspergillus infection that occurred in patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of a teaching hospital during renovation works and treated with new triazole voriconazole (Vfend). The first patient was affected with cerebral hemorrhage, the second with polytrauma and both developed Aspergillus Pneumonia during their ICU stay. Bronchoalveolar lavage, dosage with anti-Aspergillus antibodies, antigen measurements and galactomannan research with Sanofi Platelia were performed. Therapy was carried out with voriconazole for 12 days. Chest X-ray and laboratory tests showed complete resolution after 12 days of therapy clinical symptoms were negative after 4 days. Aspergillus infection can be observed frequently in non-immunocompromised patients during ward renovation or in hospitals near building areas. Since treatment is often unsuccessful, we preferred to immediately employ new agents to reduce the impact of this disease.",2006,17072284,no
Clustered sensitivity to fungi: anaphylactic reactions caused by ingestive allergy to yeasts.,"Respiratory allergy to environmental molds is relatively common, and fungal allergen-specific reactivity seems to cluster in certain persons. However, generalized reactions caused by ingested fungi have seldom been described.To describe a mold-sensitized patient who developed multiple anaphylactic reactions after ingesting a yeast preparation widely used by the food industry as flavoring in, for example, powdered and ready-made sauces.Skin prick tests and serum IgE tests were performed with inhalant and food allergens, including molds and yeasts, 2 pasta sauces consumed by the patient, individual sauce ingredients, and a food-quality yeast extract. Radioallergosorbent test inhibition was used for specificity studies.Skin prick and serum IgE test results were positive to several molds (Cladosporium herbarum, Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Penicillium notatum), baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), Malassezia furfur, and champignon and to the 2 pasta sauces, the yeast ingredient, and a food-quality yeast extract. Radioallergosorbent test inhibition studies confirmed that the sauces contain cross-reacting yeast and mold allergens.This patient has a clustered sensitization to fungi characterized by allergy to environmental fungal allergens and to yeast extracts used in the food industry. Yeasts should be considered as possible ingestive allergens in mold-allergic patients.",2006,17042133,no
Serial Aspergillus antigen monitoring in pediatric bone marrow transplant patients.,"Invasive aspergillosis carries a high mortality rate in immunocompromised patients, such as bone marrow transplant patients. Favorable outcomes are dependent on early detection and treatment. Positive galactomannan antigenemia has been included as a microbiological criterion for probable or possible diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. Detection of circulating Aspergillus DNA in the first positive galactomannan sample, with serial monitoring, could help in diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in bone marrow transplant patients. Morbidity and mortality from aspergillosis can possibly be reduced if an early diagnosis is made and appropriate treatment initiated. An effective and accurate way of early detection of invasive aspergillosis is serial Aspergillus antigen monitoring.",2006,17035619,no
"Antibodies to 60, 65 and 70 kDa heat shock proteins in pediatric allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients.","Allogeneic SCT remains the only means of cure for many patients with various malignant disorders as well as non-malignant diseases. Infection together with severe aGvHD may result in a significant incidence of transplant-related morbidity and mortality. Current evidence suggests that hSPS represent major immunodominant antigens in many pathogens and therefore might play an important role in the pathogenesis of GvHD. We investigated the levels of total Ig, IgG and IgM isotype antibodies to rh-hsp60, recombinant Mycobacterium bovis hsp65 and stress-inducible rh-hsp70 in sera of pediatric patients undergoing SCT by using ELISA. We studied whether humoral immune responses to hSPS follow transplant-related complications, bacterial and fungal infection. Anti-hsp antibodies were detected in patients' sera before conditioning, over the course of conditioning and all the time post-transplant. We found no correlation between anti-hsp antibodies and the occurrence and severity of GvHD and/or other transplant-related complications like graft failure, hemorrhagic cystitis and capillary leakage syndrome. However, elevated anti-hsp antibodies involving IgM and IgG isotypes were found to be associated with bacterial and fungal infection depending on etiological agents. We demonstrated de novo humoral response to hSPS in a cohort of patients with actual infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae (anti-hsp60, anti-hsp65 and anti-hsp70), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (anti-hsp60, anti-hsp70) and Aspergillus fumigatus (anti-hsp65). We conclude that anti-hsp antibodies might be produced after SCT in relation to infection depending on etiological agents however, transplant-related complications by themselves had a little impact.",2006,17032425,no
Fungal zymosan induces leukotriene production by human mast cells through a dectin-1-dependent mechanism.,"Fungi are capable of causing or exacerbating inflammatory disease in the airways. We have previously demonstrated that zymosan and peptidoglycan induce the production of cysteinyl leukotrienes from human mast cells. However, the mechanisms of pathogen-induced leukotriene production by immune effector cells are very poorly understood. The coreceptor dectin-1, through a Syk tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway, can mediate some responses to fungal challenge, but its expression by mast cells and its involvement in lipid mediator responses have not been assessed.In the current study, the potential role of dectin-1 in zymosan-induced leukotriene production from human mast cells was examined.Human mast cells were examined for dectin-1 mRNA and protein expression. Human mast cells were incubated with either zymosan or peptidoglycan in the presence or absence of specific inhibitors for dectin-1 or Syk tyrosine kinase and mediator production examined.Human mast cells were found to express a functional isoform of dectin-1. Both peptidoglycan and zymosan induced significant amounts of leukotriene (LT)-B4 and LTC4. The dectin-1 inhibitors laminarin and glucan phosphate reduced the LTC4 response to zymosan by more than 60% but did not alter peptidoglycan responses. Inhibitors of Syk tyrosine kinase activity significantly decreased LTC4 production in response to both peptidoglycan and zymosan.These data demonstrate mast cell expression of the coreceptor dectin-1 and a role for this molecule in the generation of cysteinyl leukotrienes.These findings suggest new approaches to the selective inhibition of lipid mediator production in response to fungal infection or exposure.",2006,17030235,no
Adaptive response of microglial cells to in vitro infection by Candida albicans isolates with different genomic backgrounds.,"It has been recently demonstrated that Candida albicans isolates with distinct genomic backgrounds (namely, b and c genotypes) express different susceptibility to antifungal activity by human monocytes in vitro. We show here that, although comparable in their ability to undergo dimorphic transition and in susceptibility to phagocytosis by microglial cells, the b and c isolates show striking differences in terms of intracellular survival. Only the c genotype resists indeed to intracellular killing and eventually replicates inside microglial cells, that in turn respond to fungal infection, preferentially towards the c genotype, with nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation and increased Mip1alpha production. These data indicate that C. albicans-microglial cell interaction is strictly dependent upon fungal genotype, strengthening the potential significance of genotyping as prognostic parameter in clinical infections by C. albicans.",2006,17008047,no
Calmodulin concentrates at the apex of growing hyphae and localizes to the Spitzenkörper in Aspergillus nidulans.,"The calmodulin (CaM) localization pattern in the growing hyphal tip of Aspergillus nidulans was studied with the functional GFP::CaM fusion protein. A faint tip-high gradient of CaM was found in the growing hyphal tip, with CaM highly localized in the region corresponding to the Spitzenkörper forming a bright granule. The position of highly concentrated CaM in the extreme apex seemed to determine the orientation of the hypha. The normal pattern of CaM localization was also shown to be dependent on the integrated actin cytoskeleton. When the growth of the hyphal tip ceased, CaM failed to localize in the bright granule and was evenly distributed in the hyphal tip. These findings suggest that CaM may play an important role in establishing and maintaining apical organization, morphogenesis, and growth in Aspergillus nidulans.",2006,16983484,no
Immunologic homeostasis during infection: coexistence of strong pulmonary cell-mediated immunity to secondary Cryptococcus neoformans infection while the primary infection still persists at low levels in the lungs.,"Maintenance of immunity to persistent pathogens is poorly understood. In this study, we used a murine model of persistent pulmonary fungal infection to study the ongoing cell-mediated immune response. CBA/J mice with low-level persistent Cryptococcus neoformans infection had CD4+ T cells of effector memory phenotype present in their lungs. Although unable to eliminate the primary infection to sterility, these mice displayed hallmarks of immunologic memory in response to rechallenge with C. neoformans: 1) the secondary cryptococcal challenge was controlled much more rapidly, 2) the inflammatory response developed and resolved more rapidly, 3) CD4+ T and CD8+ T cell responses were higher in magnitude, and 4) effector cytokine production by T cells was greatly enhanced. Depletion of CD4+ T cells at the time of secondary challenge adversely affected clearance of C. neoformans from the lungs. These results demonstrate that persistent low-level infection with C. neoformans does not impair the cell-mediated response to the fungus. Although they are relatively free of overt disease, these mice can respond with a rapid secondary immune response if the burden of C. neoformans increases. These data support the concept that immunologically healthy individuals can maintain low numbers of cryptococci that can become a nidus for re-activation disease during immunodeficient states such as AIDS.",2006,16982904,no
"Co-occurrence of aflatoxin B1, fumonisin B1, ochratoxin A and zearalenone in cereals and peanuts from Côte d'Ivoire.","This survey examined 30 samples of rice (n = 10), maize (n = 10) and peanuts (n = 10) from Côte d'Ivoire for aflatoxin B1, fumonisin B1 and zearalenone using immunoassays, and ochratoxin A using a validated HPLC method with fluorescence detection. In Côte d'Ivoire, as in other countries, several mycotoxins are present in the same commodities. These mycotoxins are from different structural families: aflatoxin B1, fumonisin B1, zearalenone and ochratoxin A, normally produced by fungal species from Aspergillus, Penicillium and Fusarium genera. Some samples contained four mycotoxins (86%). Four peanuts samples did not show ochratoxin A (14%), whereas they contained aflatoxin B1 concentrations above the EU regulatory limits. Concentrations of ochratoxin A, zearalenone and fumonisin B1 were low and may not cause problems per se however, fears remain that the tolerable daily intake may be exceeded due to eating habits and synergistic effects could be important with the combination of several mycotoxins. Investigations in this direction are underway, together with isolation and characterization of the fungal species involved.",2006,16982522,no
[Aspergillosis in systemic diseases treated with steroids and/or immunosuppressive drugs: report of 9 cases and review of the literature].,"This is a multicentric retrospective study of aspergillosis in patients treated by corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive drugs for systemic diseases and a review of the literature. Nine patients, 5 men and 4 women, mean age of 62.8 years old were included among which Horton's diseases (3 cases), systemic lupus erythematosus (2), polymyositis (1), microscopic polyangiitis (1), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (1), rheumatoid polyarthritis (1). Aspergillosis occurred in average 28.4 month after the diagnosis of systemic disease, and 28 months after the beginning of its treatment: corticosteroids in all cases, at a dose of 50.8 mg/day (equivalent prednisone) in average, cyclophosphamide (2 cases), methotrexate (1), intravenous immunoglobulins (1), leflunomide (1). All cases were invasive or chronic pulmonary aspergillosis located in the lungs (6 cases), or in the brain (3). Revealing symptoms were mild and non specific. Lymphopenia was severe in most cases, in average 472 lymphocytes/mm3 and 283 CD4+/mm3. The diagnosis was confirmed 20.75 days after the first symptoms in invasive aspergillosis, and 18.5 months in the chronic pulmonary cases, by cultures in 7 cases (broncho-alveolar lavage: 4 cerebral biopsy: 3), and direct microscopy examination of broncho-alveolar lavage in 2 cases. Specific serology was positive in 4 cases. Patients were treated by voriconazole (4 cases), itraconazole (2), amphotericin B (1), association of caspofungin and voriconazole (1), successive voriconazole and itraconazole (1). Six patients recovered from aspergillosis with 10.8 months of following time, 3 patients died a few days after confirmation of the diagnosis.

Mouse salivary glands and human beta-defensin-2 as a study model for antimicrobial gene therapy: technical considerations.,"Transduction of salivary glands with antimicrobial peptide genes has great potential for oral infection control. Our ultimate goal is to introduce antimicrobial peptide genes into salivary glands that secrete these peptides into saliva to control bacterial/fungal infection in the oral cavity. However, an animal study model to test this potential has not been established. Therefore, we determined to test (i) whether the potent antimicrobial peptide human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2) can be overexpressed in saliva after transduction of salivary glands and (ii) whether oral fungal infection can be developed in a NOD/SCID murine model. Lentiviral vector SIN18cPPTRhMLV bearing hBD-2 cDNA was introduced into SCID mouse submandibular glands via cannulation. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed to detect hBD-2 expression in glands or in saliva. Candida albicans 613p was inoculated orally into SCID mice to establish oral candidiasis. Whilst expression of hBD-2 was detected in mouse salivary glands by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry 1 day or 1 week following delivery of lentivirus, hBD-2 was not detected in saliva. There was recoverable C. albicans from the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract 4 days to 4 weeks after infection, but there was no establishment of observable oral candidiasis in SCID mice under a stereomicroscope. Our data indicate that lentiviral vectors transduce mouse salivary glands, but not at a sufficient level to allow hBD-2 detection in saliva. Other vectors for gene transduction and additional treatment of SCID mice to establish oral candidiasis are needed in order to utilise mouse salivary glands to test antimicrobial gene therapy.",2006,16963233,no
Effect of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis on lung function in children with cystic fibrosis.,"The relationship between sensitization to Aspergillus fumigatus and progression of pulmonary function is not yet established in cystic fibrosis (CF).We aimed to evaluate onset of A. fumigatus sensitization and development of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), as well as to determine the physiologic factors of lung function influencing these mechanisms in CF.Serial annual lung function tests performed in 122 children with CF (62 males 60 femalesA. fumigatus sensitization was best reflected by increased rAspf1+3-specific IgE levels, whereas, in most patients, sensitization was preceded by P. aeruginosa infection. Patients with ABPA demonstrated the most severe progression in all lung function parameters, and FEF at 50% VC, volume of trapped gas, and effective specific airway resistance were the best predictors (p < 0.0001). However, regarding distinction between sensitization to A. fumigatus and development of ABPA in the course of CF, chronic P. aeruginosa infection has to be taken into account.Airway narrowing, gas trapping, and small airway disease are the major targets for functional derangement in ABPA.",2006,16959918,no
Aspergillus galactomannan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay cross-reactivity caused by invasive Geotrichum capitatum.,"We report three cases of invasive Geotrichum capitatum infection in patients with acute leukemia for which an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for Aspergillus galactomannan was positive, with no evidence of aspergillosis. Supernatants obtained from suspensions of 17 G. capitatum strains gave positive reactions with the Aspergillus galactomannan ELISA.

Mycotoxin contamination of food in Europe: early detection and prevention strategies.,"This paper reviews the early detection and prevention strategies which have been employed in Europe for the control of mycotoxin contamination of food in the context of a hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP) framework. The critical control points (CCPs) in the whole food chain where mycotoxins such as trichothecenes and ochratoxins are important have been identified. Ecological studies on the effect of environmental factors which are marginal for growth and mycotoxin production have been identified for Fusarium culmorum and F. graminearum (deoxynivlenol production), and for Penicillium verrucosum and Aspergillus ochraceus (ochratoxin production) in relation to cereal production and for A. carbonarius in relation to grapes and wine production (ochratoxin formation). To minimise the entry of these mycotoxins into the food chain, effective and rapid diagnostic tools are required to monitor the CCPs effectively. To this end the potential use of molecular imprinted polymers, lateral flow devices and molecular-based techniques for the rapid detection and quantification of the mycotoxigenic moulds or their toxins have also been developed.",2006,16944291,no
[Contribution of dectin-1 to the recognition of fungal cell wall products and the activation of innate immune response].,"1,3-Beta-glucans is a major cell wall component in fungi. Receptor molecules relating to innate immunity may recognize such cell wall products, and affect host defense systems. A beta-glucan receptor, dectin-1, is a C-type lectin and may contribute to the innate immune responses. To examine the role of dectin-1 in recognition of 1,3-beta-glucans and subsequent activation of intracellular signaling, the molecular characteristics of a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of dectin-1 were investigated. The binding ability to beta-glucans was abolished by mutating two amino acid residues, Trp221 and His223, on the CRD. Dectin-1 increased TLR2-mediated NF-kappaB activation in response to zymosan. However, dectin-1 alone could not affect the activation pathway for NF-kappaB, nor did co-expression of dectin-1 mutant and TLR2 increase the NF-kappaB activation. These results suggest that dectin-1 may have a co-stimulatory effect on leukocyte activation in response to fungal infection.",2006,16940953,no
[Clinical analysis of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis and discovery of an elastase inhibitor].,"We studied the clinical features of 59 chronic pulmonary aspergillosis cases (aspergilloma, chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis) which we experienced in our hospital. To diagnose this disease, X-rays, sputum culture and serologic tests were mainly examined, X-ray findings were a fungus ball type in 47% of cases and thickened wall of a cavity type in 32%. Positive sputum culture found was A. fumigatus 78%, A. niger 13% and A. flavus 2%. Positive rates of serologic tests showed precipitating antibody 81% and antigen 11% 39% of beta-D glucan exceeded the reference value. As clinical symptoms, bloody sputum and hemoptysis were found at high frequency. Antifungal agents were administered intravenously or topically for treatment, primarily AMPH-B, ITCZ and MCFG. As adjuvant therapy, we administered Ulinastatin which is an elastase inhibitor for use against hemoptysis, and we performed steroid combination for cases considered to be associated with allergy. In all of 6 cases of chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis which were administered MCFG, X-ray findings improved. A pathogenic factor, elastase was isolated from Aspergillus spp., and we also found the elastase inhibitor from this series. Five of 12 strains of A. fumigatus, and one of 2 strains of A. flavus expressed elastase inhibitory activity when we screened for the culture supernatant of various Aspergillus spp. of a clinical isolate. Elastase inhibitory activity from A. niger was very weak. Culture supernatants from 5 strains of A. fumigatus and one strain of A. flavus were stable for a fever, and human leucocyte elastase was inhibited, but these did not inhibit porcine pancreas elastase. We are aiming at clinical application and plan to continue further study.",2006,16940951,no
[Recent advances of serodiagnosis for systemic fungal infections].,"Serological surrogate tests for invasive fungal infection have been used practically in Japan. The Aspergillus galactomannan antigen detection kit by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay is the most reliable test for making a diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. But in recent years, occurrences of false positive and negative results have also been reported by several investigators. Therefore, evaluation of the results of this assay should be done carefully in the clinical stage. Moreover, some other methods to detect the Aspergillus antigen or anti Aspergillus antibody in serum have also been reported. The problem of false positive results due to the frequent occurrence of non-specific reaction in the alkaline treatment, chromogenic automated kinetic assay to measure (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan had been noticed in Japan. But this important problem was resolved by improvement of the pretreatment reagent in this kit in July 2005. In this manuscript, I describe recent trends of serological surrogate tests for Aspergillus infection and the process of improvement of the (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan measurement kit.",2006,16940946,no
A novel approach for screening immunogenic proteins in Penicillium marneffei using the DeltaAFMP1DeltaAFMP2 deletion mutant of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Using serum from guinea-pigs immunized with a DeltaAFMP1DeltaAFMP2 deletion mutant of Aspergillus fumigatus to screen a cDNA library of A. fumigatus, we cloned a novel immunogenic 57-kDa protein in A. fumigatus. We also cloned its 55-kDa homologue in Penicillium marneffei, which was possibly related to amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism, with homologues present only in the subphylum Pezizomycotina of Ascomycota. The recombinant 55-kDa protein of P. marneffei reacted strongly with guinea-pig serum immunized with P. marneffei and with the sera of patients with P. marneffei infection.

"Antigen detection, serology, and molecular diagnosis of invasive mycoses in the immunocompromised host.","Understanding the uses and limitations of methods for rapid diagnosis of fungal disease is essential in order to diagnose and treat these infections early in their course. Antigen detection methods are useful for diagnosis of aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, and penicilliosis marneffei. The accuracy of the beta-glucan assay for diagnosis of aspergillosis and candidiasis and its role in fungal diagnosis remains unclear, in part because the few published studies report widely varying specificity. Serologic tests for antibodies are also useful for diagnosis of histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis, but their sensitivity may be reduced by immunosuppression. While molecular diagnostic methods have been described and are available at some reference and university laboratories, their role in patient care remains uncertain, largely because of the lack of well-characterized assays and studies establishing their accuracy. Culture methods, although essential for establishing the diagnosis in some cases, have limitations for rapid diagnosis, namely insensitivity, need for invasive procedures, and delayed growth.",2006,16913971,no
Effect of antiviral chemoprophylaxis on adverse clinical outcomes associated with cytomegalovirus after liver transplantation.,"To assess t he association be tweencytomegalovirus (CMV) serology of donor and recipient and adverse outcomes afterliver transplantation in the era of effective antiviral chemoprophylaxis.We performed a retrospective cohort study of 193 consecutive patients undergoing their first liver transplantation between February 1998 and July 2000 with targeted and preemptive ganciclovir chemoprophylaxis. Patients were divided into 4 groups by CMV serology of donor and recipient: donor-/recipient- donor-/recipient+No significant differences were observed in the rates of retransplantation, death, or survival to 1 year among the 4 groups of patients. Despite significantly higher rates of CMV infection in the donor+ groups, there were no differences in the rates of bacterial or fungal Infection or of CMV disease.

Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis: lessons from 126 patients attending a chest clinic in north India.,"To describe the experience of screening patients with asthma for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) presenting to a chest clinic. The clinical, serologic, radiologic, and treatment aspects including outcome of ABPA are also described.All consecutive patients with asthma presenting to the chest clinic over a period of 2 years were screened with an Aspergillus skin test. Patients who were found to be positive were further investigated for ABPA. Patients were also arbitrarily classified as ABPA-seropositive (ABPA-S), ABPA with central bronchiectasis (ABPA-CB), and ABPA-CB with other radiologic findings (ABPA-CB-ORF) based on the high-resolution CT findings.Five hundred sixty-four patients were screened using an Aspergillus skin test 223 patients (39.5%) were found to be positive, and ABPA was diagnosed in 126 patients (27.2%). There were 34 patients (27%) with ABPA-S, 42 patients with ABPA-CB, and 50 patients with ABPA-CB-ORF. Fifty-nine patients (46.8%) had received antitubercular therapy in the past. The vast majority of patients had bronchiectasis at presentation to our hospital. High-attenuation mucous impaction was noted in 21 patients (16.7%). There was no significant difference between the stages of ABPA and the duration of illness, the severity of asthma, and the serologic findings (ie, absolute eosinophil count, IgE levels [total] and IgE levels [for Aspergillus fumigatus]). The median duration of follow-up was 13 months (range, 9 to 38 months). All patients went into ""remission"" at 6 weeks. Twenty-five patients had a ""relapse"" during the course of their treatment. One hundred nine patients had ""complete remission,"" 17 patients were classified as having ""glucocorticoid-dependent ABPA,"" and 7 patients were classified as having ""end-stage ABPA.""There is a high prevalence of ABPA in asthmatic patients presenting at our hospital. The disease entity is still underrecognized in India the vast majority of patients have bronchiectasis at presentation, and almost half are initially misdiagnosed as having pulmonary tuberculosis.

Detection of fungal DNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction: evaluation of 2 methodologies in experimental pulmonary aspergillosis.,"The capabilities of 2 quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for detecting pulmonary aspergillosis were analyzed. Both methodologies were real-time (RT) based and were compared with quantitative cultures and galactomannan (GM) antigen detection in a rabbit model of invasive aspergillosis. A total of 106 samples including blood, serum, lung, and brain from 3 controls and 9 infected New Zealand rabbits were analyzed. The RT-PCR methodologies were an Aspergillus fumigatus-specific assay using fluorescent resonance energy transfer technology targeting a highly conserved region of the fungal 18S rRNA gene and a panfungal assay to amplify the internal transcribed spacer regions 1 and 2 from fungal rRNA gene complex, employing SYBRGreen fluorescent dye as a detector. The specificity for both PCR base assays, culture, and GM determination was 100%. The sensitivity of the specific PCR assay was 88.9% in lung samples, 66.6% in serum, 55.5% in blood, and 33.3 in brain specimens. The panfungal assay had a sensitivity of 33.3% in lung and serum samples, being brain and blood specimens invariably negative. Otherwise, 100% of the lungs resulted positive for culture, and all serum samples showed a GM index above 1.0 after 2 days of infection. The specific RT-PCR assay is a reliable technique to detect A. fumigatus DNA in vivo comparable to cultures and GM determination. The panfungal RT-PCR assay exhibited low sensitivity to diagnose invasive aspergillosis in rabbits advising against its clinical introduction.",2006,16876374,no
Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis: role of early diagnosis and surgical treatment in patients with acute leukemia.,"Aspergillus is a ubiquitous soil-dwelling fungus known to cause significant pulmonary infection in immunocompromised patients. The incidence of aspergillosis has increased during the past two decades and is a frequently lethal complication of acute leukemia patients that occurs following both chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation. The diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) according to the criteria that are established by European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer and Mycoses Study Group raise difficulties in severely ill patients. Despite established improvements in field of diagnosis (galactomannan antigen, quantitative PCR, real-time PCR for Aspergillus spp., and findings of computed tomography) and treatment with new antifungals, it is still a major problem in patients with acute leukemia. However, prompt and effective treatment of IPA is crucial because most patients will need subsequent chemotherapy for underlying hematologic disease as soon as possible.We report a 33-year-old male patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia diagnosed in 1993 that developed invasive pulmonary aspergillosis due to A. flavus at relapse in 2003. The patient was successfully treated with liposomal amphotericin B and underwent surgical pulmonary resection. The operative course was uneventful.This report emphasizes the clinical picture, applicability of recent advances in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for IPA. For early identification of a patient infected with IPA, a high index of suspicion and careful clinical and radiological examinations with serial screening for galactomannan should be established. If aspergillosis is suspected, anti-aspergillosis drug should be administered immediately, and if a unique pulmonary lesion remains, surgical resection should be considered to prevent reactivation during consecutive chemotherapy courses and to improve the outcome.",2006,16872530,no
Invasive pulmonary and central nervous system aspergillosis after near-drowning of a child: case report and review of the literature.,"Invasive aspergillosis is extremely rare in immunocompetent children. Here we describe the clinical, radiologic, and laboratory course of fatal invasive pulmonary and central nervous system aspergillosis in a previously healthy child after a near-drowning incident with submersion in a pond. Findings were compared with data from the literature, which is reviewed. Serum Aspergillus galactomannan levels were determined retrospectively and were compared with the results of routine microbiological and radiologic examinations, showing a significant diagnostic and therapeutic delay of the routine diagnostic approach in comparison with the use of the Aspergillus galactomannan assay. This delay may have contributed to the fatal course. Serial determination of serum Aspergillus galactomannan may be helpful in diagnosing invasive aspergillosis early in case of pulmonary disease after near-drowning and may contribute to an early appropriate treatment. Currently voriconazole, eventually in combination with caspofungin, should be considered as the drug of choice in the management of invasive aspergillosis after near-drowning.",2006,16864641,no
Specific antibodies to recombinant allergens of Aspergillus fumigatus in cystic fibrosis patients with ABPA.,"Aspergillus fumigatus, a widely distributed fungus, has been implicated in causing life threatening infections as well as severe asthma and allergic diseases in man. Allergic affliction like allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a disabling lung disease frequently seen in patients with asthma and cystic fibrosis. Immunodiagnosis of the former is comparatively easier due to the availability of purified antigens and sensitive methods. However, this is not true with cystic fibrosis patients where the prevalence of ABPA is fairly high and the morbidity and mortality are significant.In the present study, we have evaluated purified recombinant allergens from A. fumigatus, namely Asp f 1, f 2, f 3, f 4, and f 6 using ELISA and a semi-automated method (ImmunoCAP). We studied 17 patients each from cystic fibrosis with ABPA, and cystic fibrosis with asthma, 22 cystic fibrosis with no ABPA or asthma, and 11 age matched controls.The results indicate that no antigen, antibody or method is capable of differentiating cystic fibrosis (CF) with ABPA from other CF patients, although some allergens showed strong reaction or showed more prevalence among the patients studied.When results of several allergens such as Asp f 1, f 2, f 3, f 4, and f 6 in their binding to IgA, IgG, and IgE antibodies were analyzed, a more strong discrimination of CF patients with ABPA was possible from the other groups studied.",2006,16859543,no
Quantification of IgG antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus and pigeon antigens by ImmunoCAP technology: an alternative to the precipitation technique?,"We evaluated the ImmunoCAP technique for measurement of IgG specific to Aspergillus fumigatus and pigeon antigens.We used ImmunoCAP and precipitation technique to measure concentrations of IgG to A. fumigatus or pigeon antigens in sera from 265 patients and 42 controls. We also evaluated linearity, interference, imprecision, concordance, and diagnostic accuracy of the measuring techniques.The precipitation and ImmunoCAP technique showed moderate concordance (kappa, 0.46 for both A. fumigatus and pigeon antibodies). Specific IgG results for A. fumigatus and pigeon were linear (r = 0.98 and 0.97, respectively), with interrun reproducibility rates of 23% and 14% and maximal interference of 36.5% and 8% by lipid and 24% and 21% by hemolysis, respectively. A. fumigatus antibody concentrations were higher in patients with aspergillosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) (median, 103 and 70.1 mgA/L, respectively) than in patients with other pulmonary diseases (median, 18.15-33.40 mgA/L). Antibodies to pigeon antigens were high in patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis (median, 1024 mgA/L) but also in patients with other pulmonary diseases (median, 445 mgA/L). Antibody titers were substantially higher in patients with other pulmonary diseases and contact with pigeons (median, 1060 mgA/L) than in patients without antigen contact (median, 27.35 mgA/L) (P <0.004).Agreement between the precipitation and ImmunoCAP technique was 86% for A. fumigatus and 70% for pigeon antigens. Highest concentrations of specific IgG to A. fumigatus were found in patients with aspergillosis and ABPA. Our results suggest that antigen contact was the most important variable affecting the presence of antibodies to pigeon antigen.",2006,16858079,no
[Prophylaxis against infections in neutropenic patients].,"Infections are the main cause of death in neutropenic patients and are related to the degree and duration of neutropenia, the underlying disease, and the treatments received. To reduce the number of these infections, prophylactic strategies have been proposed. These strategies aim to prevent adquisition through contact, inhalation, or the gastrointestinal tract. Intestinal decontamination through fluoroquinolones has reduced Gram-negative infections but this strategy should not be used indiscriminately and should be reserved for high risk patients. Fluconazole as antifungal prophylaxis reduces mortality but does not modify the incidence of invasive aspergillosis. Cytomegalovirus infection should be prevented in patients with negative serology in high risk patients with positive serology, monitoring and preemptive treatment with ganciclovir or foscarnet is recommended. Hematopoietic growth factors reduce the duration of neutropenia and could reduce mortality from infection.",2006,16857151,no
"Review of epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of invasive mould infections in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.","Invasive mould infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients (HSCT). Allogeneic HSCT recipients are at substantially higher risk than autologous HSCT recipients. Although neutropenia following the conditioning regimen remains an important risk factor for opportunistic fungal infections, most cases of invasive mould infection in allogeneic HSCT recipients occur after neutrophil recovery in the setting of potent immunosuppressive therapy for graft-versus-host disease. Invasive aspergillosis is the most common mould infection. However, there has been an increased incidence of less common non-Aspergillus moulds that include zygomycetes, Fusarium sp., and Scedosporium sp. Reflecting a key need, important advances have been made in the antifungal armamentarium. Voriconazole has become a new standard of care as primary therapy for invasive aspergillosis based on superiority over amphotericin B. There is significant interest in combination therapy for invasive aspergillosis pairing voriconazole or an amphotericin B formulation with an echinocandin. There have also been advances in novel diagnostic methods that facilitate early detection of invasive fungal infections that include galactomannan and beta-glucan antigen detection and PCR using fungal specific primers. We review the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of invasive mould infection in HSCT, with a focus on allogeneic recipients. We also discuss options for prevention and early treatment of invasive mould infections.",2006,16830186,no
Characterization and comparison of galactomannan enzyme immunoassay and quantitative real-time PCR assay for detection of Aspergillus fumigatus in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from experimental invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.,"Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is widely used for evaluation of patients with suspected invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). However, the diagnostic yield of BAL for detection of IPA by culture and direct examination is limited. Earlier diagnosis may be facilitated by assays that can detect Aspergillus galactomannan antigen or DNA in BAL fluid. We therefore characterized and compared the diagnostic yields of a galactomannan enzyme immunoassay (GM EIA), quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), and quantitative cultures in experiments using BAL fluid from neutropenic rabbits with experimentally induced IPA defined as microbiologically and histologically evident invasion. The qPCR assay targeted the rRNA gene complex of Aspergillus fumigatus. The GM EIA and qPCR assay were characterized by receiver operator curve analysis. With an optimal cutoff of 0.75, the GM EIA had a sensitivity and specificity of 100% in untreated controls. A decline in sensitivity (92%) was observed when antifungal therapy (AFT) was administered. The optimal cutoff for qPCR was a crossover of 36 cycles, with sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity of qPCR also decreased with AFT to 50%. Quantitative culture of BAL had a sensitivity of 46% and a specificity of 100%. The sensitivity of quantitative culture decreased with AFT to 16%. The GM EIA and qPCR assay had greater sensitivity than culture in detection of A. fumigatus in BAL fluid in experimentally induced IPA (P+/-0.04). Use of the GM EIA and qPCR assay in conjunction with culture-based diagnostic methods applied to BAL fluid could facilitate accurate diagnosis and more-timely initiation of specific therapy.",2006,16825367,no
[Acute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in chronic lung disease--a review].,"Apart from malignancies and solid organ transplant, chronic lung disease, in particular chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is a third important predisposing factor for acute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.COPD is present in 2% of patients dying from invasive aspergillosis. This opportunistic infection occurs because of an immunodeficiency linked both to altered local immunity and to systemic factors such as long term steroid treatment and malnutrition. In patients whose sputum and/or endotracheal aspirate specimens contain hyphal forms of filamentous Aspergillus, half will have a clinically significant aspergillus infection. Diagnostic tests include serum galactomannan antigen test, serum antibody titre, thoracic CT scan and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). The identification of fungal hyphae in BAL fluid by microscopy and/or on culture is critical for a positive diagnosis. The mortality rate for acute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in chronic lung diseases reaches almost 100%. Antifungal monotherapy is still recommended as a first line treatment. Combined treatment can be used in refractory aspergillosis as a salvage therapy. The question of maintaining, decreasing or interrupting steroid treatment must be considered.Prospective studies are needed to evaluate a standardised diagnostic strategy such as exists for patients with haematological disease. Whether this will improve prognosis remains to be seen.Acute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis complicating chronic lung disease is not rare. Improved diagnosis procedures and recent therapeutic advances may have a positive impact on patient prognosis.",2006,16820744,no
Audit of laboratory mycology services for the management of patients with fungal infections in the northwest of England.,"Fungal infection is increasingly recognised as an important cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in immunocompromised patients. Little information exists on laboratory services available and the methods used by general microbiology laboratories to diagnose these important infections.To investigate the services microbiology laboratories in northwest England provide towards the diagnosis and management of superficial and deep fungal infections.A questionnaire was sent to laboratories to get a holistic view of the support given to clinicians looking after patients with fungal infections. The aim was not to investigate details of each laboratory's standard operating procedures. The completed questionnaires, which formed the basis of this report, were returned by all 21 laboratories which were recruited. This study was conducted between March 2004 and September 2004.Services were provided to District General Hospitals and to six tertiary centres, including eight teaching hospitals by 16 laboratories. Their bed capacity was 250-1300 beds. Total specimens (including bacterial and viral) processed annually were 42 000-500,000 whereas fungal ones were 560-5400.In most microbiology laboratories of northwest England, clinicians were aware of the potential of fungal pathogens to cause infections especially in immunocompromised patients. Additional measures such as prolonged incubation of samples were introduced to improve fungal yield from patients at high risk. It is necessary to train and educate laboratory and medical staff about the role of serology and molecular methods in diagnosis and management of patients with fungal infection.",2006,16803950,no
Usefulness of sequential Aspergillus galactomannan antigen detection combined with early radiologic evaluation for diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation.,"Early diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is important as prompt treatment with antifungal drugs may increase patient survival. Our study investigated the efficiency of routine testing of the Aspergillus galactomannan antigen (AGA) test in combination with chest CT scans for IPA diagnosis.From February 2002 to June 2004, 74 hemato-oncologic patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation were prospectively studied with serum AGA twice weekly from admission until death or discharge and weekly afterward when possible. Chest CT scans were performed when fever of unknown origin had lasted beyond 3 days of antibacterial therapy.Seven patients were classified with possible IPA and two patients, proven IPA. Fourteen patients showed positive results for AGA (OD index>or=1.0 on two subsequent sera). The sensitivity and specificity of the test were 100% and 93%, respectively the positive and negative predictive values were 64% and 100%, respectively. All patients with possible/proven IPA showed abnormal CT signsThe combination of AGA detection and early chest CT scans might be considered useful tools to detect minimal changes of IPA. Based on these findings, aggressive antifungal therapy should be initiated.",2006,16797366,yes

Primary hepatic invasive aspergillosis with progression after rituximab therapy for a post transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder.,"We present a case of primary hepatic and possible splenic invasive aspergillosis (IA), which progressed under anti-CD20 B cell treatment for posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disease following allogeneic stem cell transplantation, to highlight the clinical value of a positive galactomannan-antigen test, an intestinal portal of entry of Aspergillus, and the detrimental effect of B lymphocyte depletion in IA.",2006,16758192,no
Invasive aspergillosis causing small bowel infarction in a patient of carcinoma breast undergoing chemotherapy.,"To report a 45 year old lady presenting with proximal jejunal gangrene due to invasive Aspergillosis. The patient was undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy for advance carcinoma of breast (Stage IV).The patient was referred to our surgical emergency for acute abdominal symptoms for 6 hours. Histopathology revealed bowel wall necrosis and vascular invasion by Aspergillus Fumigatus. Postoperative recovery was uneventful and the patient received Amphotericin-B (1 mg/kg/day) for invasive aspergillosis. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was confirmed by isolating Aspergillus Fumigatus from bronchoalveolar lavage and by a positive circulating galactomannan test (ELISA Assay).Detailed history revealed dry cough and two episodes of haemoptesis for 2 weeks. Haemogram and counts revealed anemia and neutropenia. Plain X-ray of the abdomen showed multiple air fluid levels and ultrasound of the abdomen revealed distended bowel loops. On exploration small bowel was found to be gangrenous. The patient was successfully managed by supportive treatment and conventional intravenous Amphotericin-B for 2 weeks. The lady was discharged one week after completion of antifungal therapy and one month later she underwent toilet mastectomy. The lady came to follow up for 1 year and she is currently under hormone therapy.With the emergence of new and powerful immunosuppressive, anticancer drugs and potent antibiotics the survival of transplant and critically ill patients has remarkably increased but it has shown a significant rise in the incidence of invasive opportunistic fungal infections. We conclude hat the diagnosis of invasive gastrointestinal aspergillosis may be considered in a neutropenic patient with acute abdominal symptoms.",2006,16753069,no
Correlations between clinical and laboratory findings in patients investigated for aspergillosis.,"We investigated 120 patients suspected clinically to have pulmonary aspergillosis with different clinical manifestations ""aspergilloma (Subgroup A), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Subgroup B) and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (Subgroup C)"" and correlated between their clinical and laboratory findings and endogenous specific aflatoxin production. They were subjected to isolation of Aspergillus strains, measurement of serum total IgE and specific Aspergillus IgG by ELISA and identification of aflatoxin producing Aspergillus strains using fluorescence analysis of spectroline. Aspergillus was isolated from 45 patients (37.5%). Subgroup A had a negative statistically non-significant correlation between clinical and laboratory findings as regard total IgE and for Aspergillus IgG (only haemoptysis &weight loss had significant correlation with aspergillus IgG). Subgroup B & Subgroup C had positive, statistically significant correlation &negative statistically non significant correlation respectively as regard all clinical findings and both total IgE & serum IgG. This study also showed that 6 Aspergillus strains out of 45(13.3%) produced endogenous aflatoxin. It is concluded that a significant correlation that exists between clinical and serological findings in allergic pulmonary aspergillosis. Aflatoxins may be produced in vivo by strains of Aspergillus and may result in manifestations similar to those caused by ingestion of aflatoxin in food.",2006,16734141,no
"Square-plate culture method allows detection of differential gene expression and screening of novel, region-specific genes in Aspergillus oryzae.","When grown on solid agar medium, the mycelium of a filamentous fungus, Aspergillus oryzae, forms three morphologically distinct regions: the tip (T), white (W), and basal (B) regions. In this study, we developed the square-plate culture method, a novel culture method that enabled the extraction of mRNA samples from the three regions and analyzed the differential gene expression of the A. oryzae mycelium in concert with the microarray technique. Expression of genes involved in protein synthesis was predominant in the T region relative expression was, at most, six times higher in the T region compared to the other regions. Genes encoding hypothetical proteins were expressed at high levels in the W and B regions. In addition, genes coding transporters/permeases were predominantly transcribed in the B region. By analyzing the expression patterns of genes in the three regions, we demonstrated the dynamic changes in the regulation of gene expression that occur along the mycelium of filamentous fungi. Consequently, our study established a method to analyze and screen for region-specific genes whose function may be essential for morphogenesis and differentiation in filamentous fungi and whose traits may be beneficial to the biotechnology industry.",2006,16708193,no
Description of a novel panallergen of cross-reactivity between moulds and foods.,"The present investigation is undertaken to demonstrate a novel cross-reactivity between aeroallergens (moulds fungi imperfecti) and allergens from foods (spinach and mushroom Agaricus bisporus). We have performed a dual study in vivo and in vitro, in a population of atopic patients. Data from in vivo tests performed with spinach and mushroom have been statistically analysed. To the in vitro assays, mushroom and spinach extracts have been obtained, and sera from moulds allergic patients analysed by means of IgE-immunoblott assays. Inhibition experiments have been also performed to study a possible relation between proteins. Statistical analysis of data showed a relation between allergenicity to moulds (Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium herbarum and/or Aspergillus fumigatus), and positive skin prick tests with mushroom and/or spinach. The immunoblotts performed showed that seven moulds allergic patients had a strong recognition of a protein with a molecular weight of about 30 kD present both in spinach and mushroom extracts, and by means of inhibition assays we could determine that these two proteins were related. This study demonstrates the existence of a new allergen responsible for cross reactivity between moulds and two frequently consumed foods, mushroom and spinach. We conclude that a novel cross-reactive allergen between aeroallergens and foods has been identified.",2006,16698676,no
Binding of extracellular matrix proteins to Paracoccidioides brasiliensis.,"Adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins plays a crucial role in invasive fungal diseases. ECM proteins bind to the surface of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis yeast cells in distinct qualitative patterns. Extracts from Pb18 strain, before (18a) and after animal inoculation (18b), exhibited differential adhesion to ECM components. Pb18b extract had a higher capacity for binding to ECM components than Pb18a. Laminin was the most adherent component for both samples, followed by type I collagen, fibronectin, and type IV collagen for Pb18b. A remarkable difference was seen in the interaction of the two extracts with fibronectin and their fragments. Pb18b extract interacted significantly with the 120-kDa fragment. Ligand affinity binding assays showed that type I collagen recognized two components (47 and 80kDa) and gp43 bound both fibronectin and laminin. The peptide 1 (NLGRDAKRHL) from gp43, with several positively charged amino acids, contributed most to the adhesion of P. brasiliensis to Vero cells. Synthetic peptides derived from peptide YIGRS of laminin or from RGD of both laminin and fibronectin showed the greatest inhibition of adhesion of gp43 to Vero cells. In conclusion, this work provided new molecular details on the interaction between P. brasiliensis and ECM components.",2006,16698299,no
Comprehensive glycan analysis of recombinant Aspergillus niger endo-polygalacturonase C.,"The enzyme PGC is produced by the fungus Aspergillus niger during invasion of plant cell walls. The enzyme has been homologously overexpressed to provide sufficient quantities of purified enzyme for biological studies. We have characterized this enzyme in terms of its posttranslational modifications (PTMs) and found it to be both N- and O-glycosylated. The glycosyl moieties have also been characterized. This has involved a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF), liquid chromatography (LC)-ion trap, and LC-electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometries in conjunction with trypsin degradation and beta-elimination, followed by Michael addition with dithiothreitol (BEMAD). This is the first demonstration of the ability of BEMAD to map glycosylation sites other than O-GlcNAc sites. The complete characterization of all PTMs on PGC allows us to model them on the peptide backbone, revealing potential roles played by the glycans in modulating the interaction of the enzyme with other macromolecules.",2006,16697346,no
Highly efficient gluten degradation with a newly identified prolyl endoprotease: implications for celiac disease.,"Celiac disease is a T cell-driven intolerance to wheat gluten. The gluten-derived T cell epitopes are proline-rich and thereby highly resistant to proteolytic degradation within the gastrointestinal tract. Oral supplementation with prolyl oligopeptidases has therefore been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach. The enzymes studied, however, have limitations as they are irreversibly inactivated by pepsin and acidic pH, both present in the stomach. As a consequence, these enzymes will fail to degrade gluten before it reaches the small intestine, the site where gluten induces inflammatory T cell responses that lead to celiac disease. We have now determined the usefulness of a newly identified prolyl endoprotease from Aspergillus niger for this purpose. Gluten and its peptic/tryptic digest were treated with prolyl endoprotease, and the destruction of the T cell epitopes was tested using mass spectrometry, T cell proliferation assays, ELISA, reverse-phase HPLC, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting. We observed that the A. niger prolyl endoprotease works optimally at 4-5 pH, remains stable at 2 pH, and is completely resistant to digestion with pepsin. Moreover, the A. niger-derived enzyme efficiently degraded all tested T cell stimulatory peptides as well as intact gluten molecules. On average, the endoprotease from A. niger degraded gluten peptides 60 times faster than a prolyl oligopeptidase. Together these results indicate that the enzyme from A. niger efficiently degrades gluten proteins. Future studies are required to determine if the prolyl endoprotease can be used as an oral supplement to reduce gluten intake in patients.",2006,16690904,no
"In vitro release by Aspergillus fumigatus of galactofuranose antigens, 1,3-beta-D-glucan, and DNA, surrogate markers used for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.","Aspergillus markers are becoming increasingly important for the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. The kinetics of release of these surrogate markers, however, is largely unknown. We investigated the release of beta-(1-5)-galactofuranosyl (galf) antigens (Platelia Aspergillus), 1,3-beta-D-glucan (BG) (Fungitell), and DNA (PCR) in an in vitro model of Aspergillus fumigatus. The results showed that release is correlated to the growth phase of the fungus, which depends on available nutrients. Whereas galf antigens and BG are released during logarithmic growth, DNA is released only after mycelium breakdown. During early logarithmic growth, galf antigens seem to be released somewhat earlier than BG. Furthermore, galf antigen concentrations of more than 120,000 times the serum cutoff value (0.5 ng/ml) can be measured, while BG concentrations reach a value only 978 times the serum cutoff value (60 pg/ml). During lytical growth, release of galf antigens further increased to a maximum level, which depended on pH. After that, the concentration of galf antigens stayed high (pH 7.4) or decreased to zero within 4 days (pH 5.0). In contrast to galf antigens, BG concentration decreased after 1 day of growth. The decrease of galf components seems to be due to the enzyme beta-galactofuranosidase, which is able to destroy galf epitopes and whose activity fluctuates in the culture filtrates in parallel with galf antigen concentration. Fungal DNA seems to be released only due to autolysis caused by nutrient limitation. In conclusion, several factors clearly influence the release of surrogate markers in vitro. These same factors might also play a role at the infection site of Aspergillus disease in humans.",2006,16672397,no
Primary intestinal aspergillosis after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue.,"Primary invasive aspergillosis of the gut is a rare event and is associated with high mortality. We report for the first time on a patient who had isolated aspergillosis of the small bowel after autologous stem cell transplantation. Diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis of the gut was based on abdominal pain, galactomannan antigenemia and isolation of Aspergillus fumigatus from the stool and was later confirmed by pathohistologic examination. No other site of invasive aspergillosis was evident. The patient was successfully treated with early surgery and combination antifungal therapy.",2006,16645519,no
Expression of COX-2 and hsp72 in peritoneal macrophages after an acute ochratoxin A treatment in mice.,"Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a secondary fungal metabolite produced by Aspergillus and Penicillium strains that elicits a broad spectrum of toxicological effects in animals and man. A single oral OTA administration (10 mg/kg) in mice induced after 24 h oxidative damage and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) infiltration in parenchymal organs. In fact, OTA treatment increased lipid peroxidation (via malondialdehyde formation) in kidney and liver and PMN accumulation in duodenum, as shown by myeloperoxidase activity. Following in vivo OTA treatment an increase of cyclooxygenase-2 and of heat shock protein 72 expression was evidenced in peritoneal macrophage lysates by Western blot. That OTA modulates these proteins involved in the inflammatory process indicates that the mycotoxin is able to activate immune cells. This study suggests that the oxidative stress, the neutrophil accumulation in parenchymal tissues and the modulation of inflammatory parameters in peritoneal macrophages induced by OTA are involved in its toxicity, and represent early events related to several aspects of OTA mycotoxicosis.",2006,16643956,no
Therapeutic effect of llama derived VHH fragments against Streptococcus mutans on the development of dental caries.,"Streptococcus mutans is the main cause of dental caries. We evaluated the therapeutic effect of variable regions of a llama heavy chain antibody fragments directed against S. mutans named S36-VHH (S for Streptococcus) alone or fused with glucose oxidase (GOx) from Aspergillus niger. Western blot analysis and ELISA revealed binding of the S36-VHH to the streptococcal antigen I/II adhesin molecule of S. mutans serotype C. In a rat-desalivated caries model, daily administration of S36-VHH significantly reduced the development of smooth surface caries. No additional therapeutic effect of GOx was observed. Our results suggest that llama VHH antibodies may be a potential benefit as prophylaxis against dental caries.",2006,16636830,no
Recombinant antigens as diagnostic markers for aspergillosis.,"Eight recombinant proteins and purified galactomannan of Aspergillus fumigatus were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to quantify the anti-Aspergillus antibodies in sera of patients with aspergilloma, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), and invasive aspergillosis (IA). In spite of the variability observed in the immune responses of individual patients, quantification of the antibody titers against the 18-kDa ribonuclease (RNU), the 360-kDa catalase (CAT), and the 88-kDa dipeptidylpeptidase V (DPPV) was useful for the diagnosis of aspergilloma and ABPA. Differential diagnosis of ABPA was even possible among cystic fibrosis as well as noncystic fibrosis patients. In the group of immunocompromised patients with IA, no antibody response was mounted in response to the Aspergillus infection in any of the patients. Interestingly, about half of the patients with proven IA came to the hospital with high titers of anti-Aspergillus antibodies, suggesting that they were infected upon entry to the hospital. These results suggest that recombinant RNU, CAT, and DPPV have a great potential in the serodiagnosis of all forms of aspergillosis in the immunocompromised and immunocompetent patient.",2006,16626916,no
D-Galactose induces cellulase gene expression in Hypocrea jecorina at low growth rates.,"Lactose (1,4-O-beta-d-galactopyranosyl-d-glucose) is a soluble and economic carbon source for the industrial production of cellulases or recombinant proteins by Hypocrea jecorina (anamorph Trichoderma reesei). The mechanism by which lactose induces cellulase formation is not understood. Recent data showed that the galactokinase step is essential for cellulase induction by lactose, but growth on d-galactose alone does not induce cellulases. Consequently, the hypothesis was tested that d-galactose may be an inducer only at a low growth rate, which is typically observed when growing on lactose. Carbon-limited chemostat cultivations of H. jecorina were therefore performed at different dilution rates with d-galactose, lactose, galactitol and d-glucose. Cellulase gene expression was monitored by using a strain carrying a fusion between the cbh2 (encoding cellobiohydrolase 2, Cel6A) promoter region and the Aspergillus niger glucose oxidase gene and by identification of the two major cellobiohydrolases Cel7A and Cel6A. The results show that d-galactose indeed induces cbh2 gene transcription and leads to Cel7A and Cel6A accumulation at a low (D=0.015 h(-1)) but not at higher dilution rates. At the same dilution rate, growth on d-glucose did not lead to cbh2 promoter activation or Cel6A formation but a basal level, lower than that observed on d-galactose, was detected for the carbon-catabolite-derepressible Cel7A. Lactose induced significantly higher cellulase levels at 0.015 h(-1) than d-galactose and induced cellulases even at growth rates up to 0.042 h(-1). Results of chemostats with an equimolar mixture of d-galactose and d-glucose essentially mimicked the behaviour on d-galactose alone, whereas an equimolar mixture of d-galactose and galactitol, the first intermediate of a recently described second pathway of d-galactose catabolism, led to cellulase induction at D=0.030 h(-1). It is concluded that d-galactose indeed induces cellulases at low growth rate and that the operation of the alternative pathway further increases this induction. However, under those conditions lactose is still a superior inducer for which the mechanism remains to be clarified.",2006,16622067,no
Diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis using a galactomannan assay: a meta-analysis.,"A double-sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent galactomannan assay has been approved for surveillance for invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients. We undertook a meta-analysis to assess the accuracy of a galactomannan assay for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis.Studies of the galactomannan assay that used the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer or similar criteria as a reference standard and provided data to calculate sensitivity and specificity were included. Pooled sensitivity and specificity and summary measures of accuracy, Q* (the upper left-most point on the summary receiver-operating characteristic curve), mean D (a log odds ratio), and Youden index were calculated. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore heterogeneity.Twenty-seven studies from 1966 to 28 February 2005 were included. Overall, the galactomannan assay had a sensitivity of 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-0.74) and specificity of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.88-0.90) for proven cases of invasive aspergillosis. The Youden index, mean D, and Q* were 0.54 (95% CI, 0.41-0.65), 2.74 (95% CI, 21.12-3.36), and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.74-0.86), respectively, indicating moderate accuracy. Subgroup analyses showed that the performance of the test differed by patient population and type of reference standard used. Significant heterogeneity was present.The galactomannan assay has moderate accuracy for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients. The test is more useful in patients who have hematological malignancy or who have undergone hematopoietic cell transplantation than in solid-organ transplant recipients. Further studies with attention to the impact of antifungal therapy, rigorous assessment of false-positive test results, and assessment of the utility of the test under nonsurveillance conditions are needed.",2006,16619154,no
Nontuberculous mycobacterial disease and Aspergillus-related lung disease in bronchiectasis.,"The aim of the present study was to determine whether patients with bronchiectasis and nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) have a higher prevalence of Aspergillus-related lung disease. A series of 30 consecutive patients with bronchiectasis and NTM (cases) were compared with 61 patients with bronchiectasis and no evidence of NTM (controls). Aspergillus serology and computerised tomography of the thorax were used to identify Aspergillus-related lung diseases, including aspergilloma, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and chronic necrotising pulmonary aspergillosis. The rate of positive Aspergillus serology was higher in cases with NTM disease compared with controls (10 out of 30 versus six out of 61). The radiological features of Aspergillus-related lung disease were also more common among patients with NTM disease than controls (six out of 30 versus none out of 61). This association between NTM disease and Aspergillus-related lung disease remained significant after adjustment for confounding effects of age and lung function (adjusted odds ratio 5.1, 95% confidence interval 1.5-17.0). Patients with bronchiectasis and nontuberculous mycobacterial disease have a higher prevalence of coexisting Aspergillus-related lung disease than patients with bronchiectasis and without nontuberculous mycobacteria. Identification of Aspergillus-related lung disease is important as prognosis amongst undetected cases is invariably poor.",2006,16611651,no
Laboratory diagnosis and therapy of invasive fungal infections.,"Diagnosing fungal infections remains a problem, particularly in the immunocompromised patient. Symptoms are mostly non-specific and colonization is difficult to distinguish from invasive disease. Existing diagnostic tools often lack sensitivity. Thus, the combination of various diagnostic tools is mandatory to allow earlier diagnosis of systemic fungal infections. Microscopy, culture based methods, antigen detection, and PCR may help to facilitate and accelerate the diagnosis. Galactomannan and glucan are two promising antigens that may be useful for early detection of the infection, but also for therapeutic monitoring. Sensitive and specific PCR assays to detect fungal DNA are an important part of the diagnostic approach. But extensive validation and standardization is strongly needed, before PCR assays can be used in a routine laboratory. The tremendous increase in invasive fungal infections has led to an increased interest in new antifungal agents and the field of antifungal chemotherapy evolved even more rapidly than diagnostic assays. The development of less toxic formulations of amphotericin B, the introduction of improved azoles and the availability of the echinocandins are opening new opportunities for the treatment of fungal infections. However, continuing efforts in the laboratory and well-designed clinical trials are still needed.",2006,16611039,no
Evaluation of a newly developed down-flow immunoassay for detection of serum mannan antigens in patients with candidaemia.,"A down-flow immunoassay has been developed to detect serum mannan antigens, and the test was recently marketed as the Unimedi Candida monotest. Using 251 serum samples from 105 patients with candidaemia, a comparison of the Unimedi Candida monotest with the Cand-Tec latex agglutination test and 2 microplate enzyme immunoassay tests (Platelia Candida Ag test and Unimedi Candida) was conducted. One hundred and seventy-five febrile patients without clinical and microbiological evidence of fungal infections and pneumocytosis were examined as controls. The Cand-Tec test had a sensitivity of 38% and a specificity of 82%. The sensitivity and specificity of the Platelia Candida Ag test, the Unimedi Candida and the Unimedi Candida monotest were 53 and 92%, 69 and 89% and 82 and 96%, respectively. The sensitivity of the Unimedi Candida monotest was significantly (P<0.01) higher than that of the Plateria Candida Ag test for diagnosing candidaemia caused by Candida parapsilosis. The beta-D-glucan assay had a high sensitivity of 95%, with a specificity of 84%. Of 74 patients with candidaemia whose sera were available before or on positive blood culture sampling, 29 (39%), 38 (51%) and 48 (65%) patients had antigenemia detected using the Platelia Candida Ag test, the Unimedi Candida and the Unimedi Candida monotest, respectively. The Unimedi Candida monotest seems to be a promising tool for the early diagnosis of invasive candidiasis, because the test was sensitive, simple, rapid (approx. 1 h) and cost-effective.",2006,16585640,no
Assessment of a commercial sandwich ELISA in the diagnosis of aspergillosis in falcons.,"A commercial sandwich elisa (Platelia Aspergillus EIA Bio-Rad) developed for the detection of galactomannan, a major cell wall constituent of Aspergillus species, was tested for its efficacy in the diagnosis of aspergillosis in falcons. Ninety serum samples from 50 aspergillosis-positive falcons and 182 samples from 142 aspergillosis-negative falcons were tested. The sensitivity of the test was only 12 per cent and its specificity was 95 percent. The test was therefore unsatisfactory for detecting galactomannan in the serum samples and cannot be used as a screening test for aspergillosis in falcons.",2006,16581995,no
Multidimensional volumetric imaging of pulmonary infiltrates for measuring therapeutic response to antifungal therapy in experimental invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.,"Pulmonary infiltrates in neutropenic hosts with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis are caused by vascular invasion, hemorrhagic infarction, and tissue necrosis. Monitoring the dynamics of pulmonary infiltrates of invasive aspergillosis is an important tool for assessing response to antifungal therapy. We, therefore, introduced a multidimensional volumetric imaging (MDVI) method for analysis of the response of the volume of pulmonary infiltrates over time to antifungal therapy in experimental invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in persistently neutropenic rabbits. We developed a semiautomatic method to measure the volume of lung lesions, which was implemented as an extension of the MEDx visualization and analysis software using ultrafast computerized tomography (UFCT). Volumetric infiltrate measures were compared with UFCT reading, histopathological resolution of lesions, microbiological clearance of Aspergillus fumigatus, and galactomannan index (GMI). We also studied the MDVI method for consistency and reproducibility in comparison to UFCT. Treatment groups consisted of deoxycholate amphotericin B (DAMB) at 0.5 or 1 mg/kg of body weight/day and untreated controls (UC). Therapeutic monitoring of pulmonary infiltrates using MDVI demonstrated a significant decrease in the infiltrate volume in DAMB-treated rabbits in comparison to UC (P<or=0.001). Volumetric data by MDVI correlated with conventional CT pulmonary scores (r=0.83, P<or=0.001). These results correlated with validated biological endpoints: pulmonary infarct scores (r=0.85, P<or=0.001), lung weights (r=0.76, P<or=0.01), residual fungal burden (r=0.65, P<or=0.05), and GMI (r=0.78, P<or=0.01). MDVI correlated with key biological markers, improved the objectivity of radiological assessment of therapeutic response to antifungal therapy, and warrants evaluation for monitoring therapeutic response in immunocompromised patients with invasive aspergillosis.",2006,16569871,no
Functional genomics of innate host defense molecules in normal human monocytes in response to Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Aspergillus fumigatus induces the release of innate immune-related molecules from phagocytic cells early in the course of infection. Little is known, however, about the complex expression profiles of the multiple genes involved in this response. We therefore investigated the kinetics of early gene expression in human monocytes (HMCs) infected with conidia of A. fumigatus using DNA microarray analysis. Total RNA from HMCs at 0, 2, 4, and 6 h was extracted, linearly amplified, hybridized onto Affymetrix HG133 Plus 2.0 gene chips, and analyzed with an Affymetrix scanner. Changes in gene expression were calculated as a ratio of those expressed by infected versus control HMCs. Aspergillus fumigatus induced differential regulation of expression in 1,827 genes (P < 0.05). Genes encoding cytokines and chemokines involved in host defense against A. fumigatus, including interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-8, CXCL2, CCL4, CCL3, and CCL20, as well as the opsonin long pentraxin 3, were up-regulated during the first 2 to 6 h, coinciding with an increase in phagocytosis. Simultaneously, genes encoding CD14, ficolin1, and MARCO were down-regulated, and genes encoding IL-10 and matrix metalloproteinase 1 were up-regulated. Up-regulation of the genes encoding heat shock proteins 40 and 110 and connexins 26 and 30 may point to novel molecules whose role in the pathogenesis of aspergillosis has not been previously reported. Verification of the transcriptional profiling was obtained for selected genes by reverse transcription-PCR and enzyme immunoassay. Thus, A. fumigatus conidia induced a coordinated expression of genes important in host defense and immunomodulation.",2006,16552065,no
"High-level expression, purification, and characterization of non-tagged Aspergillus flavus urate oxidase in Escherichia coli.","The entire encoding region for Aspergillus flavus uricase was cloned into pET-32a and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The uricase was expressed in the E. coli cytoplasm in a completely soluble, biologically active form. A scalable process aimed to produce and purify multi-gram quantities of highly pure, recombinant urate oxidase (rUox) from E. coli was developed. The rUox protein was produced in a 30 L fermentor containing 25 L of 2x YT medium and purified to >99% purity using hydrophobic interaction, anion-exchange, and gel filtered chromatography. The final yield of purified rUox from fermentation resulted in approximately 27 g of highly pure, biologically active rUox per kg of cell paste (approximately 238 mg/8.8 g cell paste/L). The results presented here exhibit the ability to generate multi-gram quantities of rUox from E. coli that may be used for the development of pharmaceutics of reducing the hyperuricemia.",2006,16545578,no
Chemokines indicate allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in patients with cystic fibrosis.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is characterized by a Th2 immune response. Mouse models suggest a critical role for the Th2 chemokines thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) and macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) in ABPA.To determine whether serum levels of TARC and MDC characterize ABPA in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and to examine longitudinally if levels of TARC and MDC indicate ABPA exacerbations in patients with CF.Levels of TARC and MDC and levels of Th1 (IL-12 and IFN-gamma) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) cytokines were analyzed in serum of 16 patients with CF with ABPA, six non-CF patients with asthma with ABPA, 13 patients with CF colonized with Aspergillus fumigatus, six patients with CF sensitized to A. fumigatus, 12 atopic patients with CF, and 13 non-CF atopic control subjects by ELISA. The longitudinal course of TARC, MDC, and IgE levels was assessed during ABPA episodes.Patients with ABPA had significantly higher serum levels of TARC compared with the other patient groups. Cytokine levels did not differ among the patient groups. Longitudinally, levels of TARC indicated ABPA exacerbations in patients with CF more clearly than IgE levels. In patients with CF and ABPA, levels of TARC correlated positively with specific IgE to A. fumigatus and rAsp f4.Serum levels of TARC differentiate patients with CF or patients with asthma with ABPA from patients with CF colonized with or sensitized to A. fumigatus, atopic patients with CF, and atopic control subjects. Longitudinally, levels of TARC indicate ABPA exacerbations, suggesting TARC as a marker for identification and monitoring of ABPA in patients with CF.",2006,16543550,no
Comparison of three methodologies for the determination of pulmonary fungal burden in experimental murine aspergillosis.,"Quantitative culture, quantitative PCR and the galactomannan enzyme immunoassay (EIA) were compared for their ability to determine the pulmonary fungal burden in a murine model of invasive aspergillosis. Quantitative culture of specimens containing hyphae under-represented the absolute fungal burden in established infection when compared with the two other methods. The best correlation was observed between the two non-culture methods. Higher variability was observed with the galactomannan EIA when compared with quantitative PCR. Collectively, these data suggest that quantitative PCR is the preferred method for determination of the pulmonary fungal burden in experimental aspergillosis.",2006,16524415,no
Candidacidal activity of a monoclonal antibody that binds with glycosyl moieties of proteins of Candida albicans.,"The incidence of life threatening mycoses caused by opportunistic fungi has increased dramatically in recent years with Candida and Aspergillus being the most commonly encountered species. Candida albicans ranks among the four most common causes of bloodstream infections and is responsible for vulvovaginal candidiasis in the majority of women in their reproductive years. Limited spectrum of antifungal activity of currently available antifungals and emergence of resistance has become a serious problem. Therefore, in search of an alternative form of treatment of candidiasis, in the present study a monoclonal antibody (MAb-G5) of IgA isotype was identified from the hybridoma produced by the fusion of lymphocytes of C. albicans immunized mouse with Sp2/O cells. The MAb-G5 exhibited in vitro candidacidal activity and was also found to be useful for treatment and prophylactic use under experimental conditions in vivo.",2006,16519019,no
Inhibitor kappaB and nuclear factor kappaB in granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor antagonism of dexamethasone suppression of the macrophage response to Aspergillus fumigatus conidia.,"The dexamethasone (DEX) immunosuppressive effect on macrophage killing activity and cytokine production in response to Aspergillus fumigatus conidia is antagonized by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The molecular mechanism is unknown. We postulated that this antagonism is mediated by inhibitor kappaB (I kappaB) induction by DEX and is opposed by acceleration of I kappaB degradation by GM-CSF with or without conidia stimulation, with corresponding effects on translocation and activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB).We studied 2 types of cells, resident peritoneal macrophages from CD-1 mice and the murine macrophage RAW264.7 cell line. Cells were unstimulated or stimulated with conidia and simultaneously treated with DEX, GM-CSF, or DEX plus GM-CSF, for 2-4 hours. I kappaB degradation and NF-kappaB activation were assessed by Western blot.Macrophages stimulated with conidia alone increased NF-kappaB translocation. DEX increased I kappaB levels in cytoplasm and blocked translocation of NF-kappaB to the nucleus in unstimulated and conidia-stimulated macrophages. Conversely, GM-CSF decreased I kappaB levels. GM-CSF reversed the effect of DEX on I kappaB levels. NF-kappaB levels were minimal in DEX-treated macrophage nuclear extracts, compared with those from GM-CSF-treated and GM-CSF plus DEX-treated macrophages.GM-CSF can reverse the DEX immunosuppressive effect by enhancing I kappaB degradation and promoting NF-kappaB translocation. This would allow macrophage production of proinflammatory cytokines, facilitating resistance to aspergillosis.",2006,16518765,no
Invasive aspergillosis in children with hematologic malignancies.,"The respiratory tract is the most common system affected by aspergillosis in children with hematologic malignancies. However, Aspergillus spp. tend to invade blood vessels, resulting in systemic dissemination to multiple organs including, but not limited to, the brain, bones, liver, kidneys, and skin. Because early diagnosis and treatment are critical to the patient's outcome, a high index of suspicion should be maintained in children with hematologic malignancies who are neutropenic and have prolonged fever that is unresponsive to systemic antibacterials. Several diagnostic modalities should be used simultaneously in order to establish the diagnosis in an expeditious manner. Detailed radiographic evaluations with plain radiographs, and CT scans of the chest, sinuses, brain, and other organs should be performed as soon as clinical suspicion is raised. Detection of circulating antigens, such as galactomannan and 1,3-beta-glucan, and polymerase chain reaction appear promising in aiding in the diagnosis. A definitive diagnosis requires both a positive culture from a sterile site and evidence of tissue damage demonstrated by imaging studies or microscopic evaluations of sites of infection. Because the mortality rate is very high, empiric systemic antifungal therapy with amphotericin B, or one of its lipid formulations, should be initiated while laboratory investigations to substantiate or refute the diagnosis are continued. Surgical intervention is associated with a high mortality rate but may be of benefit in children with localized disease.",2006,16494509,no
The major allergen of Alternaria alternata (Alt a 1) is expressed in other members of the Pleosporaceae family.,"There is general consensus regarding the scarce cross-reactivity existing between Alternaria alternata and other allergenic moulds such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicillium notatum or Cladosporium herbarum. However, A. alternata has been shown to have a very significant level of allergenic cross-reactivity with other fungi belonging to the Pleosporaceae family. To date, no biological identity or homologies with other proteins have been described for Alt a 1, and it remains unclear whether the major allergen Alt a 1 contributes to the cross-reactivity shown for these moulds. Specific quantification of Alt a 1 in culture filtrates of Stemphylium botryosum, Ulocladium botrytis, Curvularia lunata, Alternaria tenuissima, C. herbarum, Penicillium chrysogenum and Asp. fumigatus, and immunoblotting using culture filtrate extracts from the above-mentioned moulds and rabbit serum anti-recombinant Alt a 1 have shown significant amounts of Alt a 1 in culture filtrates as well as antigenic components ranging from 14 to 20 kDa that strongly react with the specific serum for all taxonomically related species (Pleosporaceae family). No reactions were revealed in culture filtrates of Cladosporium, Penicillium and Aspergillus. These results restrict the cross-reactivity phenomenon due to Alt a 1 to the scope of the taxonomical term of family.",2006,16466440,no
"Caspofungin: antifungal activity in vitro, pharmacokinetics, and effects on fungal load and animal survival in neutropenic rats with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.","Evaluation of the potential of caspofungin, in relation to pharmacokinetics, in order to optimize its use in the treatment of filamentous fungal infections.The in vitro antifungal activity, pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of caspofungin versus amphotericin B was investigated in vitro as well as in a model of aerogenic Aspergillus fumigatus infection in neutropenic rats, using rat survival and decrease in fungal burden as parameters for therapeutic efficacy.In contrast to amphotericin B, caspofungin shows a concentration-dependent gradual decrease in fungal growth in vitro, which makes it difficult to perform visual readings of antifungal activity (CLSI guidelines). The quantitative XTT [2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-[(sulphenylamino) carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium-hydroxide] assay measuring a decrease in fungal metabolic activity seems more appropriate for caspofungin susceptibility testing. Using this assay, in vitro caspofungin was 4-fold less active than amphotericin B. In the infection model, therapy was started 16 h after fungal inoculation, and continued once daily for 10 days. Caspofungin was administered intraperitoneally at 1, 2, 3 or 4 mg/kg/day (CAS 1, 2, 3 or 4), amphotericin B at 1 mg/kg/day (AMB 1). Treatment with CAS 1 or AMB 1 provided modest prolongation of animal survival. The combination of caspofungin and amphotericin B did not show additive effects. Increasing the dosage of caspofungin to 2, 3 or 4 mg/kg/day resulted in a dose-dependent significant increase in efficacy. There was 100% survival among rats in the CAS 4 group, which was correlated with a significant decrease in fungal burden, based on the concentration of A. fumigatus galactomannan in serum and lung tissue and quantification of A. fumigatus DNA in lung tissue. Pharmacokinetic analysis suggested that the CAS 4 dose in rats produced drug exposure comparable to the human situation, visualized by similar 24 h AUC and trough concentrations.The therapeutic efficacy of caspofungin is superior to amphotericin B, which seemed to be discrepant with their in vitro antifungal activity.",2006,16464895,no
Occurrence and kinetics of false-positive Aspergillus galactomannan test results following treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics in patients with hematological disorders.,"Several reports have described a high rate of false-positive Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) test results for patients treated with piperacillin-tazobactam. In this retrospective study, we first examined the relationships between intravenous administration of three beta-lactam antibiotics and the occurrence of false-positive GM test results in hematology patients. We then estimated the kinetics of clearance of GM after the cessation of treatment. Sequential serum samples from 69 patients that had received beta-lactams were analyzed by using a Platelia Aspergillus test. A significant association was found between GM positivity (>/=0.5) and the administration of beta-lactams (P < 0.0001). The direct role of beta-lactams in patients' serum positivity was assessed by testing 39 batches of beta-lactams, of which 27 were positive for GM. None of the latter were positive according to a fungus- and Aspergillus-specific PCR. The kinetics of the decrease of GM was analyzed on sequential serum samples obtained after treatment. By use of a nonlinear regression model, the average time to negative antigen was assessed to be 5.5 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to [7.0]), with a half-life of elimination of GM of 2.4 days (95% CI, 1.8 to 3.0). This study confirms that the administration of beta-lactams containing GM is responsible for false-positive diagnostic results, even up to 5 days after the cessation of treatment.",2006,16455889,no
Prospective evaluation of a polymerase chain reaction-ELISA targeted to Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus flavus for the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in patients with hematological malignancies.,"Current laboratory and radiological methods for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) lack sensitivity and specificity.We prospectively evaluated the diagnostic value of twice-weekly screening for circulating Aspergillus fumigatus and A. flavus DNA with a polymerase chain reaction-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PCR-ELISA).Among the 201 adult patients with hematological malignancies who were included in the study, 55 IA cases were diagnosed. On the basis of the analysis of 1205 serum samples from 167 patients, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the PCR-ELISA for proven and probable IA cases were 63.6%, 89.7%, 63.6%, and 89.7%, respectively, when samples with 2 consecutive positive results were used. The use of a combination of the PCR-ELISA and a galactomannan (GM) assay increased the sensitivity to 83.3%, increased the negative predictive value to 97.6%, and decreased the specificity to 69.8%. In most patients with IA, PCR-ELISA positivity anticipated or was simultaneous with the initiation of antifungal therapy, the abnormalities found by computed tomography, the mycological/histological diagnosis, and the GM positivity. Overall, 56.3% of the patients had at least 1 positive sample, and the false single-positive rate was 44.8%.In addition to serial screening for GM antigenemia and radiological surveillance, PCR-ELISA may improve the rates of early diagnosis of IA and the management of patients with hematological malignancies.",2006,16453271,yes
Diagnostic approaches for immunocompromised paediatric patients with pulmonary infiltrates.,"Pulmonary infiltrates in immunocompromised children often pose problems in terms of deciding on further diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, but few studies have evaluated the value of non-invasive and invasive diagnostic methods in paediatric populations. Both galactomannan ELISA and PCR protocols appear to be less useful in children than in adults. Invasive procedures, such as bronchoalveolar lavage or lung biopsy, can yield a pathohistological diagnosis and/or the isolation of a pathogen. Prospective studies in paediatric patients are needed urgently to assess the value of different diagnostic procedures and to define an effective and safe diagnostic strategy for the individual child.",2006,16451404,no
The prognostic and diagnostic markers of invasive candidiasis in patients during chemotherapy.,"The aim of the work was the early detection of Candida spp. in clinical samples of patients with carcinoma ovariorum undergoing chemotherapy by comparing three indicators of candidiasis: presence of mannan and yeast DNA in the bloodstream and colonization of mucosal membranes by Candida species as a prognostic marker of deep candidiasis. Thirty-one women with carcinoma ovariorum, during chemotherapy without symptoms of deep fungal infections, were examined twice over a six-day period. C. albicans was the dominant organism isolated from mucosal membranes. Two serum samples were positive for mannan on the first day of examination. All these patients were previously colonized by Candida spp. on mucous membranes. Four patients were positive on the last day of examination. Three of these patients were colonized by Candida spp. C. albicans infection was detected early in 4 out of 12 clinical samples by a combination of PCR and mannan-detecting methods. Colonization increases the risk of deep candidiasis. PCR and antigen detection are fast and reliable methods for early detection of Candida in bloodstream. For patients at risk, the clinical samples must be tested by at least two independent methods.",2006,16450836,no

Pen ch 13 allergen induces secretion of mediators and degradation of occludin protein of human lung epithelial cells.,"Alkaline serine proteases from six prevalent airborne Penicillium and Aspergillus species have been identified as a group of major allergens (group 13). After entering human airways, the allergens are in initial contacts with respiratory epithelial cells. The purpose of this study is to investigate interactions between the Pen ch 13 allergen from P. chrysogenum and human lung epithelial cells.A549 cells, 16HBE14o- cells and primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpC) were exposed to purified Pen ch 13 and mediators released into culture supernatants were assayed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Cleavage of occludin in 16HBE14o- cells was analysed by immunofluorescent staining of whole cells and immunoblot analysis of whole cell extracts. Fragments generated by incubating Pen ch 13 and a synthetic peptide carrying the occludin sequence were analysed by mass spectrometry.Pen ch 13 induced productions of prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2), interleukin (IL)-8 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 by A549 cells, 16HBE14o- cells and primary cultures of HBEpC. The protease activity of Pen ch 13 is needed for the induction of PGE2 IL-8, TGF-beta1 and cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 expression. A tight junction protein occludin of 16HBE14o- cells can be cleaved by Pen ch 13 at Gln202 and Gln211 which are within the second extracellular domain of the protein.Pen ch 13 may contribute to asthma by damaging the barrier formed by the airway epithelium and stimulating the release of mediators that orchestrate local immune responses and inflammatory process from HBEpC.",2006,16436150,no
Enhanced IgE allergic response to Aspergillus fumigatus in CFTR-/- mice.,"To gain insight into aberrant cytokine regulation in cystic fibrosis (CF), we compared the phenotypic manifestations of allergen challenge in gut-corrected CFTR-deficient mice with background-matched C57Bl6 (B6) mice. Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) antigen was used to mimic allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, a peculiar hyper-IgE syndrome with a high prevalence in CF patients. CFTR-/-, C57BL/6 and FVB/NJ mice were sensitized with Af antigen by serial intraperitoneal injections. Control mice were mock sensitized with PBS. Challenges were performed by inhalation of Af antigen aerosol. After Af antigen challenge, histologic analysis showed goblet cell hyperplasia and lymphocytic infiltration in both strains. However, total serum IgE levels were markedly elevated in CF mice. Sensitized CF mice showed a five-fold greater IgE response to sensitization as compared with B6- and FVB-sensitized controls. Additional littermate controls to fully normalize for B6-FVB admixture in the strain background confirmed the role of CFTR mutation in the hyper-IgE syndrome. Cytokine mRNA levels of IL-5 and GM-CSF in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, and BAL cell differentials indicated that CFTR mutation caused a shift from an IL-5-predominant to an IL-4-predominant cytokine profile. This system models a very specific type of airway inflammation in CF and could provide insights into pathogenesis and treatment of the disease.",2006,16424881,no

Coccidioidomycosis in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.,"Coccidioidomycosis is an endemic fungal infection of the desert southwestern United States that can cause devastating disseminated infection in immunocompromised persons. Clinical coccidioidomycosis, which is caused by Coccidioides species, has been well characterized in patients who have had solid organ transplants, but it has rarely been described in patients who have received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). We report the experience of 121 consecutive HSCT recipients at a single tertiary care institution in an endemic area. One patient had fatal disseminated coccidioidomycosis after receiving an allogeneic transplant, and 2 patients had pulmonary infection before successful autologous HSCT 1 of these 2 had a reactivation of coccidioidal infection after HSCT but was treated and survived. Coccidioidomycosis was not commonly identified in HSCT recipients, even in the endemic area.

The evolution and evaluation of a whole blood polymerase chain reaction assay for the detection of invasive aspergillosis in hematology patients in a routine clinical setting.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is associated with high mortality. Successful outcome with treatment is linked to early diagnosis. The utility of classic diagnostic methods, however, is limited.To aid in the diagnosis of IA, we retrospectively assessed our diagnostic service, using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and galactomannan sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).A total of 203 patients at risk of invasive fungal infection were screened by PCR, and 116 of the patients were also tested by ELISA. The patient group comprised 176 patients with hematological malignancy and 28 control patients with evidence of invasive candidal infection. Consensus European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer and Mycoses Study Group criteria were used to classify fungal infection, which, by definition, excluded the PCR result. The PCR method was sensitive (up to 92.3% sensitivity) and specific (up to 94.6% specificity) and had good agreement with the galactomannan ELISA (76.7%) and high-resolution computed tomography scan results.A negative PCR result can be used to rule out IA and to limit the need for empirical antifungal therapy thus, it has a role in diagnosing IA infections, especially in combination with antigen testing. PCR-positive cases classified as ""false positives"" regularly reflect the limitations of classic microbiological procedures or restricted use of consensus clinical methods employed to classify infection.",2006,16421791,no
Early rise of anti-pseudomonas antibodies and a mucoid phenotype of pseudomonas aeruginosa are risk factors for development of chronic lung infection--a case control study.,"P. aeruginosa is the most significant pathogen in CF lung disease. Chronic infection is preceded by a period of intermittent colonization. Early aggressive antimicrobial treatment at initial detection of P. aeruginosa in lower respiratory tract (LRT) secretions can prevent transition to chronic infection in approximately 80% of the patients, while the rest progress to chronic infection in spite of treatment. To analyze risk factors for development of chronic infection, a cohort of 89 CF patients free of chronic infection at the study period start was followed for 10 years. 28 of the patients (study group) developed chronic infection in spite of early treatment and 28 age-matched patients who did not (controls) were included in the analysis. During the 3 years period prior to onset of chronic infection, P. aeruginosa-positive cultures were more frequent in the study group than in the controls (2.2 vs. 0.5 per year, p<0.0001). Growth of mucoid strains of P. aeruginosa was more frequent in study group than in controls (11.5% vs. 0%, p<0.0001). Most important, specific anti-pseudomonal IgG serum antibodies were significantly higher in the study group than in controls (0.98 Elisa Units vs. 0.53, p=0.04) already 3 years prior to onset of chronic infection and increased 0.44 EU pr year in the study group but remained at the initial level in the control group (p<0.005). Occurrence of Aspergillus-positive cultures were significantly more frequent in the study group than in controls (p=0.01). The strongest risk factor for development of chronic P. aeruginosa infection was increasing levels of specific anti-pseudomonal antibodies, specifically of IgG1 and IgG4 subclass and total anti-Pseudomonas IgG, 3 years prior to onset of chronic infection, with odds ratio (OR) 8.9, 7.7 and 7.4, respectively (p<0.005), and growth of mucoid P. aeruginosa strains with OR of 7.4, p=0.006). Occurrence of Aspergillus was also a risk factor for developing chronic P. aeruginosa infection with the OR of 4.7 (p=0.008).",2006,16412706,no
"An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for monitoring of Aspergillus ochraceus growth in coffee powder, chilli powder and poultry feed.","The work was carried out to develop an immunoassay for estimation of Aspergillus ochraceus biomass on solid substrate.An indirect noncompetitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for determination of fungal biomass in food commodities using antibody raised against A. ochraceus mycelial antigen. The sensitivity of the assay was linear in the range of 10-160 microg fungal biomass per millilitre extract of coffee (R(2)=0.989), poultry feed (R(2)=0.987) and chilli (R(2)=0.989). The growth of A. ochraceus in the food commodities like chilli, coffee beans and poultry feed, under the influence of two levels of moisture (20% and 30%) were monitored by the ELISA. The maximum fungal colonization was observed in poultry feed (9.8 and 11.8 mg g(-1)) followed by coffee beans (6.8 and 11.3 mg g(-1)) and chilli (5.1 and 6.3 mg g(-1)) at 20% and 30% moisture after 20 days of incubation. Similarly the fungus produced maximum ochratoxin A in poultry feed (25 and 120 microg g(-1)) followed by coffee beans (8 and 24 microg g(-1)) and chilli (0.2 and 0.45 microg g(-1)) at 20% and 30% moisture after 20 days of incubation.The method can be used for quantitative estimation of fungal biomass and comparison of fungal colonization in food substrates varying in composition.The method can be adapted for studying the fungal colonization in different solid substrates under different culture condition. The method is sensitive to mould colonization of >or=0.02% (w/w) and can be used for early detection of specific fungal infestation in food commodities.",2006,16411921,no
Stimulation of TNF-alpha release by fungal cell wall polysaccharides.,"Carboxymethylated derivatives were prepared from the (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan isolated from the cell wall of baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and from the chitin-glucan complex of the mycelium of the industrial filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger. The polysaccharides were applied to peritoneal mouse macrophages and after a 2-h incubation the release of TNF-alpha by the stimulated macrophages was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. As the third polysaccharide stimulant, a water-soluble derivative of chitin was assayed and the observed cytokine release was compared with the control experiment. In three concentrations of the polysaccharides applied, carboxymethyl glucan revealed a dramatic increase in the TNF-alpha release, while addition of carboxymethyl chitin-glucan resulted only in a moderate enhancement, and carboxymethyl chitin was inactive. The results indicate that fungal polysaccharides, especially (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan, are potent macrophage stimulators and activators of TNF-alpha release, which implies their potential application in antitumor therapy.",2006,16402554,no
Antigenuria and antigenaemia in experimental murine paracoccidioidomycosis.,"In this study, Swiss mice were experimentally infected with Paracoccidoides brasiliensis (Pb18) and we investigated the levels of gp43 in urine and plasma, anti-gp43 and IgG-gp43 immune complexes in plasma. These levels were correlated with the histopathological findings. Blood and urine samples were collected from mice at 7, 28, 56 and 84 days after intravenous inoculation of 10(5) yeast cells, and analysed by ELISA. The results showed increased levels of soluble gp43 in the plasma in all periods, and anti-gp43 IgG and immune complexes after day 28. High gp43 levels were detected in the urine, except for day 28, coincident with the presence of compact granulomas in lungs. All the infected mice showed fungal cells in the lungs, with initial granulomatous lesions at day 7, dissemination of lesions to other organs at day 56, and granulomas lacking the surrounding mononuclear cells infiltration, especially at days 56 and 84. Our results suggest that gp43 diffuses passively into the urine, and the determination of gp43 levels in urine samples may be a non-invasive alternative method for diagnosis and follow up of PCM. Further studies are needed to determine if the cellular immune response correlate with decreased urine gp43 levels.",2006,16396248,no
Prevention and monitoring of invasive fungal infections in pediatric patients with cancer and hematologic disorders.,"The occurrence of invasive fungal infection (IFIs) in a pediatric hematology/oncology unit after renovation of the ventilation system, and initiating routine azole antifungal prophylaxis was monitored. In addition, the value of serial screening for Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis was assessed.A total of 98 consecutive high-risk pediatric patients were prospectively surveyed for signs of IFI and weekly monitored for serum GM. The data was not made available to treating physicians.Only 2 patients had proven and 27 possible IFI based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group definitions. The incidence of proven IFI was 1/31 (3.2%) in the allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) (Aspergillus spp), 0/26 in the autologous SCT, and 1/60 (1.6%) in the induction therapy group (C. krusei). GM was detected at least in one tested sample in 12/98 patients (12.2%), in five patients in two or more sequential samples. In the latter group, IFI was proven in one patient and could not be excluded in the others. Four of the five patients belonged to the 31 allogeneic and one to the 26 autologous SCT patients. In patients with only one positive GM test none developed signs of IFI and only one received empirical amphotericin B.With the currently used preventative and prophylactic measures, IFI is uncommon in children with high-risk for infection. Regular screening for GM could be useful among allogeneic SCT patients and two positive samples should prompt further investigative procedures and pre-emptive antifungal therapy.",2006,16395687,yes
Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in solid organ and bone marrow transplant recipients.,"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) remains a major cause of mortality in transplant recipients. New strategies in therapy are needed.We prospectively followed all solid organ and bone marrow transplant recipients from January 1998 to January 2003 who showed pulmonary infiltrates. We retrospectively analyzed all of the patients diagnosed as having IPA. Clinical and epidemiological data were collected. Influence of new treatment strategies on survival was also analyzed.Thirty-one cases of API were found: 8 definite, 18 probable, 5 possible among recipients of liver (11), bone marrow (9), kidney (7), kidney-pancreas (3), and heart (1) transplants. Five patients (16%) were previously receiving antifungal prophylaxis. The most common symptoms were fever (74%) and dyspnea and dry cough (48%). Six cases (19%) showed dissemination to extrapulmonary sites: central nervous system (CNS) in five and bone in one. The most common radiographic patterns were alveolar infiltrates (58%) the lesions were usually diffuse and bilateral (58%). The most common Aspergillus species identified was A. fumigatus (74%). The test to detect Aspergillus antigen (galactomannan) in serum performed in 13 cases, was positive in eight (61%). The crude mortality rate was 61% (19 of 31), but in patients on mechanical ventilation, it was 94% (OR 88, IC 95%: 7.1-1094), and in patients with CNS involvement, it was 100%. The influence of the different treatment regimens on survival was analyzed in definite and probable cases: Group 1 (12) included patients who received conventional monotherapy and group 2 (12) patients received combination antifungal therapy or liposomal amphotericin B (1-AMB) at high doses. The mortality in group 1 was 83% (10 of 12), and in group 2 it was 42% (5 of 12) (P < 0.05).The mortality rate of IPA remains high, especially among patients with CNS involvement or those under mechanical ventilation. Combined antifungal therapy or monotherapy with 1-AMB at high doses significantly reduced mortality compared with conventional monotherapy.",2006,16386634,no
Decreased levels of serum immunoglobulins as a risk factor for infection after heart transplantation.,"We aimed to assess humoral immunity markers that provide prognostic value for the development of infections in heart transplant recipients.Forty-one heart transplant recipients underwent humoral immunity studies, including Immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA, IgM) and IgG subclasses determined by nephelometry on serum samples obtained before transplantation and 1 month after transplantation. Potential clinical risk factors were evaluated: waiting time for transplantation, pretransplant cytomegalovirus (CMV) serologic status of donor and recipient recipient ageWe measured infections requiring intravenous (IV) drug therapy during the first year. The association between variables and outcome was assessed using Cox proportional hazards modelling. Immunoglobulin levels were split into two groups using the median value observed as the cut-off.Of 41 patients studied, 19 (46%) had at least one episode of infection, 16 of which were CMV infections treated with IV gancyclovir, 1 CMV disease + aspergillosis and 2 bacterial pneumonia. Pretransplant IgG (<1055 mg/dL RR 5.32The existence of decreased levels of IgG in the setting of heart transplantation was associated with an higher risk for infection. Monitoring of immunoglobulin levels, a rapid and well-standardized nephelometric determination, in heart transplantation, may identify a subset of patients at risk for development of infections.",2006,16386623,no
DIAGNOSIS OF HISTOPLASMOSIS.,"Endemic mycoses can be challenging to diagnose and accurate interpretation of laboratory data is important to ensure the most appropriate treatment for the patients. Although the definitive diagnosis of histoplasmosis (HP), one of the most frequent endemic mycoses in the world, is achieved by direct diagnosis performed by micro and/or macroscopic observation of Histoplasma capsulatum (H. capsulatum), serologic evidence of this fungal infection is important since the isolation of the etiologic agents is time-consuming and insensitive. A variety of immunoassays have been used to detect specific antibodies to H. capsulatum. The most applied technique for antibody detection is immunodiffusion with sensitivity between 70 to 100 % and specificity of 100%, depending on the clinical form. The complement fixation (CF) test, a methodology extensively used on the past, is less specific (60 to 90%). Detecting fungal antigens by immunoassays is valuable in immunocompromised individuals where such assays achieve positive predictive values of 96-98%. Most current tests in diagnostic laboratories still utilize unpurified antigenic complexes from either whole fungal cells or their culture filtrates. Emphasis has shifted, however, to clinical immunoassays using highly purified and well-characterized antigens including recombinant antigens. In this paper, we review the current conventional diagnostic tools, such as complement fixation and immunodiffusion, outline the development of novel diagnostic reagents and methods, and discuss their relative merits and disadvantages to the immunodiagnostic of this mycosis.",2006,20445761,no
Efficacy of amphotericin B or amphotericin B-intralipid in combination with caspofungin against experimental aspergillosis.,"Infections caused by Aspergillus species are increasing in importance, especially among immunocompromised hosts. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of combination treatment consisting of the polyene amphotericin B (AMB) or amphotericin B-intralipid admixture (AMB-IL) and the echinocandin caspofungin (CAS) in experimental murine systemic aspergillosis. Inhibition of synthesis of a major component of the fungal cell wall and an effect on the cell membrane, by combining echinocandin and a polyene, may result in a synergistic interaction in vitro and in vivo against Aspergillus fumigatus.ICR mice were immunosuppressed by intraperitoneal (ip) administration of cyclophosphamide (CY). Three days post-CY administration the mice were inoculated intravenously (iv) with A. fumigatus conidia. Infection and treatment were evaluated during an observation period of 30 days in terms of mortality (survival rate and mean survival time) and morbidity (quantitative determination of fungal burden, histopathology, and detection of serum galactomannan).The data showed that combined CAS and AMB or AMB-IL treatment increased the survival of the mice (up to 69.2%) as compared to those treated with each agent alone (44.4, 40.7 and 50%, respectively), and prolonged their mean survival time to 22.5 days. These combinations also resulted in reduction of fungal burden in organs, and decrease in serum galactomannan.The successful results obtained in the experimental animal model of this study may possibly open the way to more effective management of aspergillosis in humans.",2005,16360214,no
"Anti-inflammatory effects of moxifloxacin on IL-8, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha secretion and NFkappaB and MAP-kinase activation in human monocytes stimulated with Aspergillus fumigatus.","We have previously shown that moxifloxacin conferred protective anti-inflammatory effects against Candida pneumonia in immunosuppressed mice. Further in vitro studies showed anti-inflammatory effects of moxifloxacin in LPS and cytokine-stimulated monocytic and epithelial cells. In the present study, concentrating on a more challenging pathogen of immunosuppressed hosts, we studied the effect of moxifloxacin on cytokine secretion and signal transduction mechanisms in monocytic cells stimulated with Aspergillus fumigatus.Human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) and a human monocytic cell line (THP-1) were incubated with 1.5x10(6)/mL conidia of a clinical isolate of A. fumigatus. Cytokine secretion and activation of NFkappaB and the MAP-kinases ERK1/2 and p38 were measured with and without the addition of moxifloxacin (5-20 mg/L).Stimulation of PBMCs and THP-1 cells with A. fumigatus increased IL-8, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha secretion (4.1-, 8.3- and 7-fold, and 5.4-, 3.7- and 17.8-fold, respectively). Addition of moxifloxacin (5-20 mg/L) inhibited cytokine secretion up to 45.7+/-5%, 72+/-13% and 73+/-10% in PBMCs and up to 35.6+/-0.5%, 30+/-2.4% and 19+/-4% in THP-1 cells (P<0.05). Signal transduction studies showed that incubation of THP-1 cells with A. fumigatus increased ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation and p65-NFkappaB protein expression by 1.6-, 1.3- and 1.8-fold, respectively. Addition of moxifloxacin inhibited ERK1/2, p38 and p65-NFkappaB by up to 69+/-14%, 58+/-3% and 75+/-15%, respectively.Our results indicate that moxifloxacin acts as an anti-inflammatory agent in monocytic cells stimulated with A. fumigatus conidia. Whether these effects may be protective as in the Candida pneumonia model is unknown and merits in vivo studies in models of pulmonary aspergillosis.",2005,16352735,no
A case of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis leading to pneumonia with unusual organisms.,"We describe the case of a 50-year-old male with a history of asthma and seizure disorder who presented with a 5-month history of dyspnea. The patient had been treated with multiple courses of antibiotics for presumed community-acquired pneumonia before being determined to have allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) by serologic and radiographic criteria. Inflammation resulting from this disease had potentiated a postobstructive pneumonia caused by Nocardia asteroides and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Therapy with corticosteroids, trimethoprim sulfa, and voriconazole failed to prevent subsequent destruction of the right upper lobe and the patient required surgical intervention. The discussion emphasizes the diagnostic criteria for ABPA including historic, serologic, and radiographic findings staging, and treatment. Other possible diagnoses, such as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, chronic necrotizing aspergillosis, and hyper-IgE syndrome are also briefly reviewed.",2005,16351036,no
Tryptophan residue is essential for immunoreactivity of a diagnostically relevant peptide epitope of A. fumigatus.,"The role of tryptophan (Trp17) in immunoreactivity of P1, the diagnostically relevant peptide from a major allergen/antigen of Aspergillus fumigatus, was evaluated by chemically modifying tryptophanyl residue of P1. In BIAcore kinetic studies, unmodified P1 showed a 100-fold higher binding with ABPA (Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis) patients' IgG [KD (equilibrium dissociation constant) = 2.74 e(-8) +/- 0.13 M] than the controls' IgG (KD = 2.97 e(-6) +/- 0.14 M), whereas chemically-modified P1 showed similar binding [KD patients' IgG = 3.25 e(-7) +/- 0.16 M, KD controls' IgG = 3.86 e(-7) +/- 0.19 M] indicating loss of specific immunoreactivity of P1 on tryptophan modification. Modified P1 showed loss of specific binding to IgE and IgG antibodies of ABPA patients in ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay). The study infers that tryptophan residue (Trp17) is essential for immunoreactivity of P1.",2005,16335802,no
Evaluation of a (1->3)-beta-D-glucan assay for diagnosis of invasive fungal infections.,"The Fungitell assay (Associates of Cape Cod, Inc.) is a commercial test that detects (1-3)-beta-D-glucan (BG) and is intended for diagnosis of invasive fungal infections. To evaluate the Fungitell assay, we tested serum and plasma samples from healthy blood donors and from patients with blood cultures positive for yeast or bacteria. All 36 blood donors were BG negative, and 13 of 15 candidemic patients were BG positive. Of 25 bacteremic patients, 14 (10 with gram-positive bacteremia) were BG positive. One of the latter patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia also had invasive candidiasis, based on histological findings in a tissue biopsy therefore, the BG result was a true positive. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the Fungitell assay, by patient, for these three groups were 93.3%, 77.2%, 51.9%, and 97.8%, respectively. We also performed the Fungitell assay on sera that had been tested for Aspergillus galactomannan or Histoplasma antigen. All six Histoplasma antigen-positive patients and 31 of 32 Aspergillus galactomannan-positive patients were also BG positive. BG results for the 10 Histoplasma antigen-negative and the 32 Aspergillus galactomannan-negative patients varied, but we were unable to confirm many of the results. Between-run coefficients of variance (CVs) for the assay ranged from 3.2% to 16.8%",2005,16333082,no
Evaluation of the role of real-time PCR in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.,"Recently, two developments relating to the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) have occurred. First, the standardisation of criteria for determining the category of this disease according to the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycosis (EORTC) Study Group consensus definitions has allowed comparison of results from different studies to be undertaken. The second development is the generation of PCR assays based on real-time technologies that are able to quantify Aspergillus DNA. In this review the benefits and limitations of these new published assays are compared with nested-PCR assays and enzyme immuno assays. Results from studies where these real-time assays have been used and patient's infections were classified according the EORTC definitions are examined. The effect of anti-fungal treatment is noted. The requirement for both international standards and a consensus protocol that is sensitive enough for IA diagnosis, particularly in blood, is discussed.",2005,16321822,no
Evaluation of pulmonary infiltrates in patients after stem cell transplantation.,"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is potentially curative therapy that has become the standard of care for many hematologic malignancies. Pulmonary complications occur in about 50% of stem cell transplant recipients and no other organ dysfunction has a higher mortality. Unfortunately the diagnosis of these infiltrates is hampered by the poor yield from routine studies and this patient population is rarely able to tolerate more risky procedures that will obtain tissue for microscopy and culture. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is usually insufficient to make a diagnosis of invasive fungal, significant bacterial, or pathogenic viral infections in patients that will still benefit from a change in therapy. In this review we discuss the infectious etiologies of pulmonary infiltrates post hematopoietic stem cell transplant, the non-infectious causes of infiltrates such as diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, engraftment syndrome, and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, and the yield of newer diagnostic procedures ranging from peripheral blood galactomannan to cytomegalovirus antigenemia, and report on new technologies that promise more accurate and timely diagnoses of these infiltrates.",2005,16321812,no
Interaction of airway epithelial cells (A549) with spores and mycelium of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"To study the interaction of airway epithelial cell line A549 with fragments of mycelium, spores of Aspergillus fumigatus in vitro and to determine if toll-like receptors (TLRs) are involved in the process.A549 cells were exposed to fragments of A. fumigatus mycelium, zymosan and inactivated A. fumigatus spores. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-8 released by A549 cells to the culture supernatant were measured by ELISA. Presence of TLR2 and TLR4 on A549 cells were studied by immuno-histochemistry.Mycelium fragments of A. fumigatus showed strong binding to epithelial cells but had limited effects on the release of IL-6 and IL-8 by A549 cells. Irradiated A. fumigatus spores were partly internalised by A549 cells and inhibited A549 cells to produce IL-6. TNF-alpha pre-incubated A549 cells produced increased IL-6 after exposure to zymosan and WIAF. Immuno-histochemistry showed a negative staining for TLR2 and TLR4.The low levels of cytokines produced by A549 cells after the firm binding of either mycelium or spores of A. fumigatus may lead to insufficient recruitment of inflammatory cells to the infected site, which may result in the escape of detection by the immune defence system. TLR2 and TLR4 are probably not or only in part involved in the above process, although very low expression cannot be excluded.",2005,16321648,no
Coccidioidomycosis: a diagnostic challenge.,"Coccidioidomycosis is a systemic fungal infection acquired endemically in the southwestern United States. Clinical disease is quite common in the dog though less frequently recognized in the cat, disease is often severe at the time of diagnosis. Diagnosis can be a challenge because serology, while specific, is not very sensitive and quantitative titration of antibodies does not correlate entirely with clinical disease in dogs. Radiographs, serum biochemistry tests and complete blood counts are beneficial additions to the database when establishing a diagnosis",2005,16317911,no
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in a patient with cystic fibrosis: diagnostic criteria when the IgE level is less than 500 IU/mL.,"Recently, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation developed a consensus report recommending diagnostic criteria for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in patients with cystic fibrosis that includes a serum IgE level greater than 500 IU/mL as the ""minimal diagnostic criterion.""To describe a 7-year-old girl with ABPA whose serum IgE level increased to only 398 IU/mL.Total IgE and anti-Aspergillus serologic measurements were performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and standard laboratory techniques HLA analysis was performedA 7-year-old girl with cystic fibrosis who had mild pulmonary disease and well-controlled asthma developed pulmonary infiltrates, increased wheezing, and decreased pulmonary function. Additional studies demonstrated peripheral blood eosinophilia (eosinophil count, 1807 cells/mm3 [19%]) and an increase in IgE and IgG anti-Aspergillus serology bronchoalveolar lavage revealed septate hyphae with 45 degrees branching subsequently identified as A fumigatus and pulmonary eosinophilia. Previous HLA typing revealed that the patient was HLA-DR2+, DRB*1501, HLA-DQ2-, a pattern associated with increased risk of ABPA. In addition, there was increased up-regulation of CD23 molecules by interleukin 4 stimulation on the patient's B cells, as observed in ABPA. The patient was treated with corticosteroids and itraconazole with resolution of symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates.Examination of the pulmonary inflammatory response using bronchoalveolar lavage, genetic risk with HLA-DR2+DQ2- typing, and increased interleukin 4 sensitivity are useful adjunctive studies in the diagnosis of ABPA.",2005,16312174,no
Endosperm-specific co-expression of recombinant soybean ferritin and Aspergillus phytase in maize results in significant increases in the levels of bioavailable iron.,"We have generated transgenic maize plants expressing Aspergillus phytase either alone or in combination with the iron-binding protein ferritin. Our aim was to produce grains with increased amounts of bioavailable iron in the endosperm. Maize seeds expressing recombinant phytase showed enzymatic activities of up to 3 IU per gram of seed. In flour paste prepared from these seeds, up to 95% of the endogenous phytic acid was degraded, with a concomitant increase in the amount of available phosphate. In seeds expressing ferritin in addition to phytase, the total iron content was significantly increased. To evaluate the impact of the recombinant proteins on iron absorption in the human gut, we used an in vitro digestion/Caco-2 cell model. We found that phytase in the maize seeds was associated with increased cellular iron uptake, and that the rate of iron uptake correlated with the level of phytase expression regardless of the total iron content of the seeds. We also investigated iron bioavailability under more complex meal conditions by adding ascorbic acid, which promotes iron uptake, to all samples. This resulted in a further increase in iron absorption, but the effects of phytase and ascorbic acid were not additive. We conclude that the expression of recombinant ferritin and phytase could help to increase iron availability and enhance the absorption of iron, particularly in cereal-based diets that lack other nutritional components.",2005,16307363,no
Influence of galactomannans with different molecular weights on the gelation of whey proteins at neutral pH.,"The effect of locust bean gum, a galactomannan, with different molecular weights on the microstructure and viscoelastic properties of heat-induced whey protein gels has been studied using confocal laser scanning microscopy and small-deformation rheology. The results obtained clearly showed that differences in the molecular weight of the polysaccharide have a significant influence on the gel microstructure. Homogeneous mixtures and phase-separated systems, with dispersed droplet and bicontinuous morphologies, were observed by changing the polysaccharide/protein ratio and/or the molecular weight. At 11% whey protein, below the gelation threshold of the protein alone, the presence of the nongelling polysaccharide induces gelation to occur. At higher protein concentration, the main effect of the polysaccharide was a re-enforcement of the gel. However, at the higher molecular weight and concentration of the nongelling polymer, the protein network starts to lose elastic perfection, probably due to the formation of bicontinuous structures with lower connectivity.",2005,16283758,no
Enumeration and detection of aerosolized Aspergillus fumigatus and Penicillium chrysogenum conidia and hyphae using a novel double immunostaining technique.,"The identification of collected airborne unicellular fungal conidia and hyphae using nonviable techniques is subjective and an imprecise process. Similarly, to determine whether an individual is allergic to a particular genus requires a separate immunodiagnostic analysis. This study demonstrates the development of a novel double immunostaining halogen assay, which enables (1) the simultaneous identification of collected airborne fungal conidia and hyphae of Aspergillus fumigatus and Penicillium chrysogenum using monoclonal antibodies and (2) the demonstration of patient-specific allergy to the same particles using human serum IgE. The results demonstrate that when conidia were ungerminated the binding of antibodies was homogeneous and localized in close proximity around the entire conidia for both species. However, when conidia were germinated, the proportion expressing antigen increased (P < 0.0001) for both species and the sites of binding of the two antibodies changed with double immunostaining restricted to the hyphal tips for A. fumigatus, in addition to the sites of germination for P. chrysogenum. The described immunoassay has the potential to identify fungal particles in personal environmental air samples, provided species-specific monoclonal antibodies are available, while simultaneously demonstrating allergic sensitization to the same particles by co-staining the samples with the patient's own serum. Such an immunoassay can use those fungi that the patient is actually exposed to and potentially avoids many problems associated with extract variability based on the performance of current diagnostic techniques for fungal allergy.",2005,16280129,no
"Comparison of galactomannan detection, PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and real-time PCR for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in a neutropenic rat model and effect of caspofungin acetate.","The performance of different in vitro diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) was investigated in a transiently neutropenic rat model. Rats were immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide and then inoculated intravenously with 1.5 x 10(4) CFU Aspergillus fumigatus spores. Animals were then either treated with caspofungin acetate, 1 mg/kg/day for 7 days, or not treated. PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), real-time PCR, and galactomannan (GM) detection were performed on postmortem blood samples, along with culture of liver, lung, and kidney homogenate. Caspofungin-treated animals showed a decrease in residual tissue burden of A. fumigatus from organ homogenate compared to untreated animals (P < 0.002). PCR-ELISA returned positive results for 11/17 animals treated with antifungal agents and for 10/17 untreated animals. Galactomannan was positive in 8/17 caspofungin-treated animals and 4/17 untreated animals. Real-time PCR was positive in 2/17 treated and 3/17 untreated animals. This study demonstrates that PCR-ELISA is a more sensitive test than either GM detection (P = 0.052) or real-time PCR (P < 0.01) for diagnosis of IA but that any of the three tests may return false-negative results in cases of histologically proven disease. Galactomannan indices from animals treated with antifungal agents showed a trend (P = 0.1) towards higher levels than those of untreated animals, but no effect was observed with PCR-ELISA indices (P = 0.29). GM detection, as previously described, may be enhanced by the administration of caspofungin, but PCR-ELISA appears not to be affected in the same way. We conclude that PCR-ELISA is a more sensitive and reliable method for laboratory diagnosis of IA.",2005,16275948,no
False positivity for Aspergillus antigenemia related to the administration of piperacillin/tazobactam.,"Invasive aspergillosis is a challenge to the internist, and difficulties diagnosing the disease remain an everlasting problem.We reviewed the data of 65 patients with hematological malignancies and aplastic anemia who were tested for the galactomannan (GM) antigen of Aspergillus between March and November 2003.GM antigen levels were false-positive in at least two consecutive samples in 5 out of 23 patients who did not have evidence of invasive aspergillosis (false positivity rate of 21.7%) but who received concomitant piperacillin/tazobactam (P/T) compared to 0 of 28 patients who did not.The use of P/T in febrile, neutropenic patients decreases the specificity of GM antigen testing, which may lead to incorrect and unnecessary attempts at diagnosis and therapy.",2005,16275542,no
[Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis complicating septic shock].,"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is an opportunistic infection with a poor prognosis, occurring primarily in patients who are severely immunocompromised.We report a case of IPA that occurred in a 37-year-old woman with no history of previous immunosuppression or significant co-morbidity. She was admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) with septic shock and multi-organ failure complicating a bacterial pneumonia. After an initial improvement, her condition deteriorated on the 10th day after admission with fever and lesions consistent with IPA seen on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). IPA was confirmed by isolating Aspergillus fumigatus from bronchoalveolar lavage and by a positive circulating galactomannan test (sandwich ELISA). First line therapy with voriconazole had to be stopped after 12 days due to hepatic toxicity. The patient was successfully treated with caspofungine for 2 months then itraconazole for 4 months with progressive improvement of HRCT abnormalities. Her galactomannan test became negative at 6 months.The diagnosis of IPA must be considered in critically ill patients even in the absence of underlying immunosupression where suggestive HRCT abnormalities occur in the context of septic shock and multiple organ failure.",2005,16272983,no
Detection of airborne Stachybotrys chartarum macrocyclic trichothecene mycotoxins in the indoor environment.,"The existence of airborne mycotoxins in mold-contaminated buildings has long been hypothesized to be a potential occupant health risk. However, little work has been done to demonstrate the presence of these compounds in such environments. The presence of airborne macrocyclic trichothecene mycotoxins in indoor environments with known Stachybotrys chartarum contamination was therefore investigated. In seven buildings, air was collected using a high-volume liquid impaction bioaerosol sampler (SpinCon PAS 450-10) under static or disturbed conditions. An additional building was sampled using an Andersen GPS-1 PUF sampler modified to separate and collect particulates smaller than conidia. Four control buildings (i.e., no detectable S. chartarum growth or history of water damage) and outdoor air were also tested. Samples were analyzed using a macrocyclic trichothecene-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ELISA specificity was tested using phosphate-buffered saline extracts of the fungal genera Aspergillus, Chaetomium, Cladosporium, Fusarium, Memnoniella, Penicillium, Rhizopus, and Trichoderma, five Stachybotrys strains, and the indoor air allergens Can f 1, Der p 1, and Fel d 1. For test buildings, the results showed that detectable toxin concentrations increased with the sampling time and short periods of air disturbance. Trichothecene values ranged from <10 to >1,300 pg/m3 of sampled air. The control environments demonstrated statistically significantly (P < 0.001) lower levels of airborne trichothecenes. ELISA specificity experiments demonstrated a high specificity for the trichothecene-producing strain of S. chartarum. Our data indicate that airborne macrocyclic trichothecenes can exist in Stachybotrys-contaminated buildings, and this should be taken into consideration in future indoor air quality investigations.",2005,16269780,no
Secretion of Streptomyces tendae antifungal protein 1 by Lactococcus lactis.,"Lactococcus lactis, the model lactic acid bacterium, is a good candidate for heterologous protein production in both foodstuffs and the digestive tract. We attempted to produce Streptomyces tendae antifungal protein 1 (Afp1) in L. lactis with the objective of constructing a strain able to limit fungal growth. Since Afp1 activity requires disulfide bond (DSB) formation and since intracellular redox conditions are reportedly unfavorable for DSB formation in prokaryotes, Afp1 was produced as a secreted form. An inducible expression-secretion system was used to drive Afp1 secretion by L. lactis Afp1 was fused or not with LEISSTCDA, a synthetic propeptide (LEISS) that has been described to be a secretion enhancer. Production of Afp1 alone was not achieved, but production of LEISS-Afp1 was confirmed by Western blot and immunodetection with anti-Afp1 antibodies. This protein (molecular mass: 9.8 kDa) is the smallest non-bacteriocin heterologous protein ever reported to be secreted in L. lactis via the Sec-dependent pathway. However, no anti-fungal activity was detected, even in concentrated samples of induced supernatant. This could be due to a too low secretion yield of Afp1 in L. lactis, to the absence of DSB formation, or to an improper DSB formation involving the additional cysteine residue included in LEISS propeptide. This raises questions about size limits, conformation problems, and protein secretion yields in L. lactis.",2005,16258626,no
Voriconazole therapy in children with cystic fibrosis.,"There is increasing evidence for the efficacy of the antifungal voriconazole, particularly in immunosuppression. We describe our experience of using voriconazole in children with CF.We performed a retrospective case note review of children with CF treated with voriconazole in a single centre over an 18 month period.A total of 21 children aged 5 to 16 years (median 11.3) received voriconazole for between 1 and 50 (22) weeks. Voriconazole was used as monotherapy in 2 children with recurrent allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) significant and sustained improvements in clinical and serological parameters for up to 13 months were observed, without recourse to oral steroids. Voriconazole was used in combination with an immunomodulatory agent in a further 11 children with ABPA, with significant improvement in pulmonary function and serology. 8 children without ABPA but who had recurrent Aspergillus fumigatus isolates and increased symptoms also received voriconazoleVoriconazole may be a useful adjunctive therapy for ABPA in CF. Voriconazole monotherapy appears to be an alternative treatment strategy when oral corticosteroids may not be suitable.",2005,16243008,no
Immunosuppressive effects of CCL17 on pulmonary antifungal responses during pulmonary invasive aspergillosis.,"Aspergillus fumigatus-sensitized CCR4-deficient (CCR4-/-) mice exhibit an accelerated clearance of conidia during fungal asthma. In the present study, we examined the roles of CCL17 and CCL22, two CCR4 ligands, during pulmonary invasive aspergillosis in neutropenic mice. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis revealed that wild-type C57BL/6 (CCR4+/+) mice were significantly protected from the lethal effects of Aspergillus compared with their wild-type controls following systemic neutralization with anti-CCL17 but not anti-CCL22 antibodies. Systemic neutralization of CCL17 significantly increased whole-lung CCL2 levels. Mouse survival and histological analysis revealed that the receptor mediating the deleterious effects of CCL17 was CCR4 since mice genetically deficit in CCR4 (CCR4-/-) did not develop invasive aspergillosis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis of whole-lung samples at day 2 after conidial challenge in neutrophil-depleted CCR4-/- and CCR4+/+ mice revealed that whole-lung IL-12 levels were significantly increased in the CCR4-/- group compared with the wild-type group. Also at day 2 after conidial challenge, significantly greater numbers of CD11c+ F4/80+ and CD11c+/CD86+ but fewer CD3/NK1.1+ cells were present in the lungs of CCR4-/- mice compared with their wild-type counterparts. Thus, CCL17-CCR4 interactions dramatically impair the pulmonary antifungal response against A. fumigatus in neutropenic mice.",2005,16239514,no
Invasive Cryptococcus laurentii disease in a nine-year-old boy with X-linked hyper-immunoglobulin M syndrome.,We report a 9-year-old boy with X-linked hyper-immunoglobulin M syndrome and invasive Cryptococcus laurentii infection identified on the basis of morphologic and biochemical characteristics and serologic tests. Fluconazole treatment resulted in complete recovery.

"Influence of long-term dietary administration of procymidone, a fungicide with anti-androgenic effects, or the phytoestrogen genistein to rats on the pituitary-gonadal axis and Leydig cell steroidogenesis.","Procymidone is a fungicide with anti-androgenic properties, widely used to protect fruits from fungal infection. Thereby it contaminates fruit products prepared for human consumption. Genistein-containing soy products are increasingly used as food additives with health-promoting properties. Therefore we examined the effects of long-term dietary administration (3 months) of the anti-androgen procymidone (26.4 mg/animal per day) or the phytoestrogen genistein (21.1 mg/animal per day) to rats on the pituitary-gonadal axis in vivo, as well as on Leydig cell steroidogenesis and on spermatogenesis ex vivo. The procymidone-containing diet elevated serum levels of LH and testosterone and, furthermore, Leydig cells isolated from procymidone-treated animals displayed an enhanced capacity for producing testosterone in response to stimulation by hCG or dibutyryl cAMP, as well as elevated expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage (P450 scc) and cytochrome P450 17alpha (P450c17). In contrast, the rate of DNA synthesis during stages VIII and IX of spermatogenesis in segments of seminiferous tubules isolated from genistein-treated rats was decreased without accompanying changes in the serum level of either LH or testosterone. Nonetheless, genistein did suppress the ex vivo steroidogenic response of Leydig cells to hCG or dibutyryl cAMP by down-regulating their expression of P450 scc. Considered together, our present findings demonstrate that long-term dietary administration of procymidone or genistein to rats exerts different effects on the pituitary-gonadal axis in vivo and on Leydig cell steroidogenesis ex vivo. Possibly as a result of disruption of hormonal feedback control due to its anti-androgenic action, procymidone activates this endocrine axis, thereby causing hyper-gonadotropic activation of testicular steroidogenesis. In contrast, genistein influences spermatogenesis and significantly inhibits Leydig cell steroidogenesis ex vivo without altering the serum level of either LH or testosterone.",2005,16214947,no
Detection of Aspergillus galactomannan antigenemia to determine biological and clinical implications of beta-lactam treatments.,"Detection of Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) in serum with the Platelia Aspergillus enzyme immunoassay (EIA) is useful for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis. From May 2003 to November 2004, 65 patients who did not develop aspergillosis had at least two positive sera while receiving a beta-lactam treatment (GM index [GMI], >or=0.5). Of the 69 treatment episodes scored, 41 consisted of a beta-lactam other than piperacillin-tazobactam (n=29), namely, amoxicillin-clavulanate (n=25), amoxicillin (n=10), ampicillin (n=3), or phenoxymethylpenicillin (n=2). In all cases, antigenemia became negative 24 h to 120 h upon stopping the antibiotic. Monitoring of 35 patients, including 26 with hematological malignancies, revealed three antigenemia kinetic patterns: each was observed with any drug regimen and consisted of a persistent GMI of >2.0 (65.7%), >0.5, and <or=1.5 (25.7%) or a variable GMI (14.3%) from the onset of antibiotic therapy. All available drug batches given to 26 patients cross-reacted with the EIA. Galactomannan titration in batches failed to predict the GM titers in the five patients studied at cumulative doses of ampicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate, regardless of the time lapse between serum sampling and infusion period. Our results show that beta-lactams other than piperacillin-tazobactam may lead to false presumption of aspergillosis. The resulting kinetic patterns of GM antigenemia are variable, and sampling serum prior to the next beta-lactam dose may not decrease GMI below the threshold. Consequently, testing of suspected antibiotic batches remains the only indicator of possible false EIA positivity.",2005,16207986,no
Use of real-time PCR to process the first galactomannan-positive serum sample in diagnosing invasive aspergillosis.,"Positive galactomannan (GM) anti-genemias are included as a microbiological item in the diagnosis of probable or possible invasive aspergillosis (IA). Because false-positive GM results frequently occur, at least two positive results on two different samples are required. Waiting for clinical specimens can delay the initiation of treatment. As an alternative, we wondered whether detection of circulating Aspergillus DNA on the first positive GM serum sample could aid in diagnosing IA. Therefore, we retrospectively screened the first GM-positive serum samples from 29 patients from our hematology unit for Aspergillus DNA using real-time PCR. We compared the real-time PCR results with the final classification of proven, probable, and possible IA according to consensual criteria. No clear correlation between PCR results and the classification with the medical files could be shown. However, a positive PCR result was associated with a poor prognosis (Fisher's test P=0.01). Our preliminary data suggest that a positive PCR result could indicate a more advanced stage of the disease. Therefore, concomitant positive PCR and GM results may justify the initiation of antifungal therapy in neutropenic patients. In contrast, a negative PCR on the first positive GM sample may argue for postponing costly antifungal administration until additional arguments for the diagnosis of IA are presented.",2005,16207969,no
Galactomannan and computed tomography-based preemptive antifungal therapy in neutropenic patients at high risk for invasive fungal infection: a prospective feasibility study.,"Empirical antifungal therapy is the standard treatment for persistent or relapsing antibiotic-resistant neutropenic fever. However, overtreatment resulting in increased toxicity and treatment-related cost is a major shortcoming of such therapy. We assessed the feasibility of a ""preemptive"" approach based on the incorporation of sensitive, noninvasive diagnostic tests for consecutive high-risk neutropenic patients who had received fluconazole prophylaxis while avoiding empirical therapy.A total of 136 treatment episodes for persons who were at risk of acquiring invasive fungal infection (IFI) were screened for the presence of galactomannan with an enzyme immunoassay. A diagnostic evaluation, which included thoracic computed tomography scanning (HRCT) and bronchoscopy with lavage, was performed on the basis of well-defined clinical, radiological, and microbiological criteria. Only seropositive patients and patients with a positive microbiological test result plus supportive radiological findings received liposomal amphotericin B.Neutropenic fever developed in 117 episodes, of which at least 41 episodes (35%) satisfied existing criteria for empirical antifungal therapy. However, our protocol-driven preemptive approach reduced the rate of antifungal use for these episodes from 35% to 7.7% (a 78% reduction) and led to the early initiation of antifungal therapy in 10 episodes (7.3%) that were clinically not suspected of being IFI. No undetected cases of invasive aspergillosis were identified 1 case of zygomycosis was missed. Breakthrough candidemia was diagnosed by conventional culture techniques and was treated successfully. With use of a preemptive approach, the 12-week survival rate for patients with IFI was 63.6% (it was 63.1% for those with invasive aspergillosis).Preemptive therapy based on enzyme immunoassay and HRCT reduced the exposure to expensive and potentially toxic drugs and offered effective antifungal control, but it failed to detect non-Aspergillus IFI.",2005,16206097,no
Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored fungal polysaccharide in Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Galactomannan is a characteristic polysaccharide of the human filamentous fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus that can be used to diagnose invasive aspergillosis. In this study, we report the isolation of a galactomannan fraction associated to membrane preparations from A. fumigatus mycelium by a lipid anchor. Specific chemical and enzymatic degradations and mass spectrometry analysis showed that the lipid anchor is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI). The lipid part is an inositol phosphoceramide containing mainly C18-phytosphingosine and monohydroxylated lignoceric acid (2OH-C(24:0) fatty acid). GPI glycan is a tetramannose structure linked to a glucosamine residue: Manalpha1-2Manalpha1-2Manalpha1-6Manalpha1-4GlcN. The galactomannan polymer is linked to the GPI structure through the mannan chain. The GPI structure is a type 1, closely related to the one previously described for the GPI-anchored proteins of A. fumigatus. This is the first time that a fungal polysaccharide is shown to be GPI-anchored.",2005,16204227,no
"Cross-reactivity of Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Stachybotrys antigens using affinity-purified antibodies and immunoassay.","In this study, the author examined the cross-reactivities of Stachybotrys chartarum, Aspergillus niger/fumigatus, and Penicillium notatum with affinity-purified rabbit sera. The molds were grown for expression of maximum numbers of antigens, after which they were extracted and mixed with commercially available extracts. The mixture was used for antibody preparation in rabbits, measurement of antibody levels, and for the demonstration of the degree of cross-reactivity. Control rabbits were injected with saline, yet they produced significant levels of immunoglobulin G antibodies against all mold extracts tested. The author interpreted this result to mean that sera obtained from rabbits immunized with pure mold extracts likely reflected cross-reactivity with other molds. Therefore, only affinity-purified antibodies and the most sensitive immunoassay technique (i.e., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) were used for the cross-inhibition studies. The antigenic cross-reactivities were as follows: (a) between Aspergillus and Penicillium, 19.6-21.0% (b) between Stachybotrys and Aspergillus, 8.2-8.7%",2005,16201672,no
"Asp f6, an Aspergillus allergen specifically recognized by IgE from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, is differentially expressed during germination.","Aspergillus fumigatus is a pathogenic mould causing allergic and invasive respiratory diseases. Allergic bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA) is a severe pulmonary complication resulting from hypersensitivity to A. fumigatus proteins. Aspergillus allergen Asp f6 is recognized by IgE from ABPA patients, but not from sensitized individuals, a fact that can be used to differentiate between these two groups of allergic patients.Proteins from hyphae, resting and germinating conidia of A. fumigatus were compared by SDS-PAGE. Protein identification was performed using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Recombinant A. fumigatus allergens were used to isolate specific monoclonal antibodies (mab) from a hybridoma bank generated against Aspergillus proteins.A hyphae-specific 23 kDa A. fumigatus protein was identified as the allergen Asp f6/manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Differential expression of MnSOD was confirmed by immunoblot using a specific mab. In contrast, Asp f8 another intracellular, but not ABPA-specific allergen, was detected in hyphae and conidia.Aspergillus fumigatus is able to colonize its environment by the formation of hyphae. Hyphae are found in the lung of ABPA patients, but not in patients suffering from atopic asthma. Our finding that Asp f6 is specifically expressed in hyphae might explain why an IgE response to Asp f6 is specific for ABPA patients.",2005,16197477,no
Bone marrow cryptococcosis: a case report.,"A 35-year-old male presented with fever and bilateral cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy. Peripheral blood film examination revealed thrombocytopaenia. Bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy, done for evaluation of thrombocytopaenia and pyrexia showed presence of ill-defined granulomas along with cryptococcal yeast forms. Fine needle aspiration of lymph nodes, cerebrospinal fluid and sputum analyses also showed cryptococci. ELISA for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antigen was positive. Granulomas, when found in bone marrow aspiration smears and trephine biopsy, are a valuable histological clue to an opportunistic infection. Disseminated fungal infection such as cryptococcosis should raise the possibility of immunosuppression, especially Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome. Bone marrow examination is a useful method of diagnosing opportunistic fungal and mycobacterial infections in patients with fever, anaemia or thrombocytopaenia and underlying HIV infection.",2005,16196381,no
[Early and differential diagnosis for fungal infection by PCR in case of living donor liver transplantation].,"Although opportunistic infection including fungal infection is often associated with living donor liver transplantation followed by immunosuppressive therapy, antifungal agents are empirically given to most patients without a definitive diagnosis of fungal infection. Indeed, there is no diagnostic test available, that shows both high sensitivity and specificity for fungal infection. In this study, we developed a polymerase chain reaction(PCR)-based system for rapid diagnosis of fungal infection. This system consisted of two PCR steps: the first PCR for most species of fungi and 4 kinds of nested PCR for Aspergillus or Penicillium (ASP/PEN), Candida glabrata (C. glab), other Candida species including Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, and Candida guiliermondii (CAN), and a broad spectrum of fungi (Broad). The newly developed PCR-based system was applied to 28 recipients of with living donor liver transplantation to determine its clinical usefulness in early and differential diagnosis of fungal infection. A total of 514 blood samples from 28 patients ware analyzed. Nested PCR assays were positive in 118 samples from 19 patients: 4 patients (30 samples) with ASP/PEN, 5 patients (29 samples) with C. glab, 12 patients (61 samples) with CAN. All of these samples were positive with nested PCR for Broad as well. Even in samples that were negative on blood culture or ELISA for Aspergillus antigen, nested PCR assays were able to amplify the fungal DNA. Furthermore, all samples positive for Aspergillus antigen tested positive on nested PCR. In conclusion, the PCR-based system we developed was thought to be useful for early diagnosis of fungal infection.",2005,16190352,no
Laboratory diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.,"Invasive aspergillosis occurs in a wide range of clinical scenarios, is protean in its manifestations, and is still associated with an unacceptably high mortality rate. Early diagnosis is critical to a favourable outcome, but is difficult to achieve with current methods. Deep tissue diagnostic specimens are often difficult to obtain from critically ill patients. Newer antifungal agents exhibit differential mould activity, thus increasing the importance of establishing a specific diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. For these reasons, a range of alternate diagnostic strategies have been investigated. Most investigative efforts have focused on molecular and serological diagnostic techniques. The detection of metabolites produced by Aspergillus spp and a range of aspergillus-specific antibodies represent additional, but relatively underused, diagnostic avenues. The detection of galactomannan has been incorporated into diagnostic criteria for invasive aspergillosis, reflecting an increased understanding of the performance, utility, and limitations of this technique. Measurement of (1,3)-beta-D glucan in blood may be useful as a preliminary screening tool for invasive aspergillosis, despite the fact that this antigen can be detected in a number of other fungi. There have been extensive efforts directed toward the detection of Aspergillus spp DNA, but a lack of technical standardisation and relatively poor understanding of DNA release and kinetics continues to hamper the broad applicability of this technique. This review considers the application, utility, and limitations of the currently available and investigational diagnostic modalities for invasive aspergillosis.",2005,16183515,no
Direct activation of gelatinase B (MMP-9) by hay dust suspension and different components of organic dust.,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in tissue destruction in allergic airway diseases. We studied the ability of various allergenic substances to directly activate recombinant 92kDa proMMP-9. The substances included hay dust suspension (HDS) and its components (supernatant, particulate matter and wash fluid of particulate matter), storage mite extract and two Aspergillus fumigatus extracts. The allergen suspensions were incubated in vitro with proMMP-9. After incubation the conversion of proMMP-9 to 10kDa lower active forms were studied using gelatin zymography and Western immunoblot quantified by computerized densitometry. All studied allergens except HDS significantly and efficiently activated proMMP-9 as compared to a negative control. At the concentrations employed, the most potent activators were A. fumigatus extracts and mite suspension. The greater potency of mite and fungi as proMMP-9 activators suggests that these allergens may be more damaging to airways even at low concentrations.",2005,16181685,no
Immunoglobulin G antibodies against environmental moulds in a Norwegian healthy population shows a bimodal distribution for Aspergillus versicolor.,"Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against moulds related to indoor dampness problems are used as biomarkers to indicate exposure. In the present study, we evaluated the frequency of mould exposure in an adult healthy population by examining levels of mould-specific IgG antibodies in Norwegian blood donors. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, 106 blood donor sera were analyzed for IgG antibodies to Aspergillus versicolor, Penicillium chrysogenum, Cladosporium herbarum, Stachybotrys chartarum and Fusarium oxysporum. The levels of specific IgG antibodies to P. chrysogenum, C. herbarum and S. chartarum correlated (r = 0.46-0.62). Responses to A. versicolor were considerably stronger than to the other moulds, and another 996 blood donor sera were analyzed for IgG antibodies to this mould. Women had significantly higher levels of specific IgG antibodies to A. versicolor than men. The concentration of A. versicolor-specific IgG antibodies showed a non-Gaussian, bimodal distribution profile, in which 12.5% were defined as positive to exposure. This suggests that significant mould exposure in a healthy population can be calculated from mean + 1SD. Western blotting analyses showed that antibody responses to A. versicolor were largely directed against carbohydrate antigens of unknown saccharides.",2005,16179015,no
Comparison of PCR-ELISA and galactomannan detection for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.,"To compare PCR with galactomannan antigen detection for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA).We prospectively collected serial blood samples from haematological patients at risk of IA, and analysed their samples retrospectively for galactomannan (GM) antigen using the Platelia test and for aspergillus DNA using an in-house PCR-ELISA assay. Matched GM and PCR analyses were performed on 263 samples from 25 patients. Patients were classified for potential IA according to international consensus criteria, with five patients classified as positive (four proven, one probable) and 20 classified as negative (seven possible, 13 no evidence IA).All five patients with IA were positive by PCR with positive results in 24 of 82 samples, whereas three of five patients were positive by GM with four of 82 samples being positive. Three of 20 patients without IA were positive by PCR in 18 of 181 samples, whereas corresponding results for GM detection were one of 20 and one of 181, respectively. Adjustment of ELISA cut-off values and/or the requirement for two consecutive samples to be positive generated different results however, lowering the positivity index (PI) for GM detection to 0.5 did not improve the sensitivity of the assay. Optimal results for PCR detection and GM were: 100% and 60% sensitivity, 85% and 95% specificity, 0.625 and 0.75 positive predictive value, and 1.0 and 0.8 negative predictive value, with a false-positive sample rate of 8 and 0.4%, positive likelihood ratio of 6.66 and 11.99 and negative likelihood ratio of 0 and 0.42, respectively.This PCR method is very sensitive for the diagnosis of IA but is associated with a moderate rate of false positives the GM assay exhibited poor sensitivity but high specificity. Further evaluation of PCR assays for the diagnosis of IA and other invasive fungal infections is warranted.",2005,16175901,yes
Production of bifunctional proteins by Aspergillus awamori: llama variable heavy chain antibody fragment (V(HH)) R9 coupled to Arthromyces ramosus peroxidase (ARP).,"The Arthromyces ramosus peroxidase gene (arp) was genetically fused to either the 5'- or 3'-terminal ends of the gene encoding llama variable heavy chain antibody fragment V(HH) R9, resulting in the fusion expression cassettes ARP-R9 or R9-ARP. Aspergillus awamori transformants were obtained which produced up to 30 mgl(-1) fusion protein in the culture medium. Both fusion proteins showed peroxidase activity in an ABTS activity test. Considerable amounts of fusion protein were detected intracellularly, suggesting that the fungus encounters problems in secreting these kind of proteins. ELISA experiments showed that ARP-R9 was less able to bind its antigen, the azo-dye RR6, as compared to R9-ARP. Furthermore, in contrast to R9-ARP, ARP-R9 bound to RR6 did not show peroxidase activity anymore. These results indicate that fusion of ARP to the C-terminus of the antibody fragment V(HH) R9 (R9-ARP) is the preferred orientation.",2005,16169108,no
Galactomannan does not precede major signs on a pulmonary computerized tomographic scan suggestive of invasive aspergillosis in patients with hematological malignancies.,"Detection of serum galactomannan (GM) antigen and presence of the halo sign on a pulmonary computerized tomographic (CT) scan have a high specificity but a low sensitivity to diagnose invasive aspergillosis (IA) in patients at risk for this disease. To our knowledge, the relationship between the time at which pulmonary infiltrates are detected by CT and the time at which GM antigens are detected by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) has not been studied.In a prospective study, tests for detection of GM were performed twice weekly for patients with hematological malignancies who had undergone hematopoetic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or had received induction and/or consolidation chemotherapy. A pulmonary CT scan was performed once weekly. Infiltrates were defined as either major or minor signs. IA was classified as proven, probable, or possible, in accordance with the definition stated by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group.We analyzed 161 episodes of infection in 107 patients (65 allogeneic HSCT recipients, 30 autologous HSCT recipients, and 66 induction and/or consolidation chemotherapy recipients). A total of 109 episodes with no IA, 32 episodes with possible IA, and 20 episodes with probable or proven IA were identified. Minor pulmonary signs were detected by CT in 70 episodes (43%), and major pulmonary signs were detected by CT in 11 episodes (7%). Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed no significant association between detection of GM by EIA and detection of abnormal pulmonary signs by CT. A significant association was found between GM levels and receipt of piperacillin-tazobactam. GM test results were not positive before major signs were seen on CT images. Only 7 (10%) of 70 patients with minor pulmonary signs had positive GM test results before detection of the greatest pathologic change by CT.We show that detection of GM by EIA does not precede detection of major lesions by pulmonary CT. In the clinical setting, the decision to administer mold-active treatment should based on detection of new pulmonary infiltrates on CT performed early during infection, rather than on results of EIA for detection of GM.",2005,16163633,yes
Resveratrol glucoside (Piceid) synthesis in seeds of transgenic oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.).,"Resveratrol is a phytoalexin produced in various plants like wine, peanut or pine in response to fungal infection or UV irradiation, but it is absent in members of the Brassicaceae. Moreover, resveratrol and its glucoside (piceid) are considered to have beneficial effects on human health, known to reduce heart disease, arteriosclerosis and cancer mortality. Therefore, the introduction of the gene encoding stilbene synthase for resveratrol production in rapeseed is a tempting approach to improve the quality of rapeseed products. The stilbene synthase gene isolated from grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) was cloned under control of the seed-specific napin promotor and introduced into rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) by Agrobacterium-mediated co-transformation together with a ds-RNA-interference construct deduced from the sequence of the key enzyme for sinapate ester biosynthesis, UDP-glucose:sinapate glucosyltransferase (BnSGT1), assuming that the suppression of the sinapate ester biosynthesis may increase the resveratrol production in seeds through the increased availability of the precursor 4-coumarate. Resveratrol glucoside (piceid) was produced at levels up to 361 microg/g in the seeds of the primary transformants. This value exceeded by far piceid amounts reported from B. napus expressing VST1 in the wild type sinapine background. There was no significant difference in other important agronomic traits, like oil, protein, fatty acid and glucosinolate content in comparison to the control plants. In the third seed generation, up to 616 microg/g piceid was found in the seeds of a homozygous T3-plant with a single transgene copy integrated. The sinapate ester content in this homozygous T3-plant was reduced from 7.43 to 2.40 mg/g. These results demonstrate how the creation of a novel metabolic sink could divert the synthesis towards the production of piceid rather than sinapate ester, thereby increasing the value of oilseed products.",2005,16160820,no
Aerosolized sodium hypochlorite inhibits viability and allergenicity of mold on building materials.,"Commercial and residential buildings can become contaminated with molds, which may trigger allergic disorders. Mold remediation efforts may require costly replacement of mold-contaminated building materials. Disinfectants that contain dilute sodium hypochlorite can kill mold and are practical to use. Whether they also inhibit mold allergy symptoms is unknown.We tested the hypothesis that sodium hypochlorite-containing spray products kill Aspergillus fumigatus and inhibit A fumigatus allergens.A fumigatus was grown on 3 common building construction materials, as well as in solution by conventional laboratory methods. Two sodium hypochlorite-containing household products (diluted bleach and Tilex) were sprayed on the mold-contaminated materials or added to mold in solution and compared with untreated controls. Surface mold and associated debris were mechanically removed from treated and untreated boards. Conidia in the extracted board materials were quantified by light microscopy, examined for morphologic changes by scanning electron microscopy, and cultured for viable mold. Extracts were tested for A fumigatus antigen by ELISA, and for A fumigatus allergen by skin prick testing using extracts prepared from both the boards and the cultured solutions.Both sodium hypochlorite disinfectants killed A fumigatus in solution and on mold-contaminated building materials. Light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy demonstrated changes to the conidial surface. Both dilute bleach and Tilex inhibited A fumigatus recognition by ELISA. Skin testing supported the results of the ELISAs and demonstrated loss of skin test reactivity to the sodium hypochlorite-treated mold solutions in most of the subjects. Of the 4 individuals who had a positive skin test result to mold grown on oriented strand board building material, 3 no longer reacted to extracts from bleach-treated boards.Spray application of sodium hypochlorite-containing disinfectants onto mold-contaminated building material kills A fumigatus, modifies the surface characteristics of A fumigatus conidia, reduces recognition of A fumigatus mold by ELISA, and results in loss of skin test reactivity to the treated mold in individuals allergic to A fumigatus.",2005,16159635,no
Reproducibility of low galactomannan enzyme immunoassay index values tested in multiple laboratories.,"The Platelia galactomannan enzyme immunoassay is a commercially available nonculture method for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis. Recently, steps have been taken to improve sensitivity specifically, a low (0.5 to 0.7) galactomannan index (GMI) value to determine positivity has been validated by multiple groups. We evaluated the intra-assay and interassay reproducibility at low index levels using three different kit lots on three different days in three different microbiology laboratories. Clinical and spiked sera were blinded and sent with galactomannan enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kits to the participating laboratories. We also prospectively collected data on all galactomannan EIAs performed between 1 September 2003 and 21 July 2004 at the University of Washington Medical Center microbiology laboratory to assess reproducibility of clinical samples analyzed in ""real time."" From the multilaboratory study, a total of 836 results were available for evaluation. Reproducibility was excellent between laboratories and on different days. Significant variability was seen between runs/lots, which may in part be associated with different threshold control values in different kits. Among the 1,410 clinical samples that were prospectively analyzed, 168 (90%) were confirmed to be positive on repeat testing (GMI, > or =0.5). Among the 19 (10.2%) initially positive samples not confirmed on repeat testing, the majority had a GMI at the threshold of the assay (between 0.5 and 0.7). Our findings suggest that the Platelia galactomannan immunoassay has good reproducibility. However, changes in GMI levels when different kit lots are used, and single samples with low-positive (GMI of 0.5 to 0.7) indices, should be interpreted with caution.",2005,16145143,no
An Aspergillus oryzae acetyl xylan esterase: molecular cloning and characteristics of recombinant enzyme expressed in Pichia pastoris.,"We screened 20,000 clones of an expressed sequence tag (EST) library from Aspergillus oryzae (http://www.nrib.go.jp/ken/EST/db/index.html) and obtained one cDNA clone encoding a protein with similarity to fungal acetyl xylan esterase. We also cloned the corresponding gene, designated as Aoaxe, from the genomic DNA. The deduced amino acid sequence consisted of a putative signal peptide of 31-amino acids and a mature protein of 276-amino acids. We engineered Aoaxe for heterologous expression in P. pastoris. Recombinant AoAXE (rAoAXE) was secreted by the aid of fused alpha-factor secretion signal peptide and accumulated as an active enzyme in the culture medium to a final level of 190 mg/l after 5 days. Purified rAoAXEA before and after treatment with endoglycosidase H migrated by SDS-PAGE with a molecular mass of 31 and 30 kDa, respectively. Purified rAoAXE displayed the greatest hydrolytic activity toward alpha-naphthylacetate (C2), lower activity toward alpha-naphthylpropionate (C3) and no detectable activity toward acyl-chain substrates containing four or more carbon atoms. The recombinant enzyme catalyzed the release of acetic acid from birchwood xylan. No activity was detectable using methyl esters of ferulic, caffeic or sinapic acids. rAoAXE was thermolabile in comparison to other AXEs from Aspergillus.",2005,16129506,no
Invasive aspergillosis in the hematologic and immunologic patient: new findings and key questions in leukemia.,"Patients suffering from acute leukemia are at high risk for invasive aspergillosis and a large review and a recent clinical trial have shown that they represent the largest group of patients developing the disease. New host groups such as patients with multiple myeloma or low-grade lymphoproliferative disorders have contributed to an increase in the incidence of invasive aspergillosis over recent years. There are substantial differences in the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic outcome of disease between patients with a hematological malignancy and other host groups such as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients. Galactomannan detection ELISA test is more specific in adult patients with hematological malignancies than in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients. As a result of possible improvement of the underlying immune deficiency upon recovery from neutropenia, survival is higher in leukemic patients with invasive aspergillosis than in other host groups. However, there is currently no evidence of an effective antifungal prophylaxis strategy against aspergillosis in leukemic patients. As these patients account for a majority of the aspergillosis cases, clinical trials on prophylaxis should not only be focused on allogeneic stem transplant recipients but also be designed for the patient with leukemia.",2005,16110815,no
Pathophysiology and immunology of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a complication of persistent asthma and cystic fibrosis (CF), diseases in part characterized by excessive viscous mucus and compromised mucociliary clearance. Inhaled conidia of Aspergillus fumigatus are able to persist and germinate, releasing exoproteases and other fungal products that further compromise clearance, breach the epithelium, and activate immune responses. Chemotactic cytokines (e.g. IL-8, RANTES, eotaxin) in particular have been implicated in murine models. Chemokine-mediated recruitment of CD4+TH2 lymphocytes specific for A. fumigatus is a crucial feature of ABPA. Susceptibility also appears to involve immunogenetic factors including atopy and defined major histocompatibility complex-restricted allelic expression on antigen-presenting cells that are permissive for a TH2-predominant immune response. Certain A. fumigatus allergens appear more associated with ABPA rather than simple A. fumigatus allergy. ABPA is characterized by marked local and systemic eosinophilia, an adaptive immune response with elevated levels of A. fumigatus-specific IgG, IgA and IgE antibodies, and a profound nonspecific IL-4-dependent elevation in total IgE. Clinically, ABPA manifests with recurring episodes of asthma, pulmonary infiltrates, and central bronchiectasis that may progress to fibrosis. It is treated with systemic glucocorticoids and azoles. Monitoring clinical, radiographic and serologic responses (especially total IgE) is essential for successful management.",2005,16110813,no
Aspergillus antigens: which are important?,"Aspergillus fumigatus is a ubiquitous fungus that causes a variety of diseases in man and animals. A number of protein, carbohydrate, and glycoprotein antigens have been identified from A. fumigatus. The diseases are diverse, and therefore are the antigens and their roles in causing or modulating the diseases. The induction and binding of antibodies and the interaction of antigen and various immune cells are of immense significance in the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease. In recent years, over 20 genes encoding A. fumigatus antigens have been cloned and the proteins expressed. Among these allergens, Asp f 1, f 2, f 3, f 4, and f 6 showed strong but diverse IgE binding with sera from different groups of patients. Results currently available suggest that Asp f 2, f 3, and f 6 together reacted with IgE from more patients with asthma and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), although they are only marginally effective in demonstrating specific IgE in patients with cystic fibrosis and ABPA. The molecular structure of allergens also plays a major role in the immunological response in the allergic patients. Antigens can be engineered with less or more binding with IgE, and such antigens may have significant roles as specific reagents or as immunomodulators.",2005,16110811,no
Molecular methods for the identification of Aspergillus species.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised hosts. In some institutions, species of Aspergillus less susceptible to amphotericin B than Aspergillus fumigatus are becoming more common, making an accurate identification of species important. However, species identification has traditionally relied on macroscopic colony characteristics and microscopic morphology, which may require several days of culture. Additional sub-culturing on specialized media may be required to induce conidia formation in some cases conidia may never form, confounding identification. Therefore, rapid, nucleic acid-based methods that identify species of Aspergillus independent of morphology are now being developed to augment or replace phenotypic identification methods. The most successful methods to date have employed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of target sequences within the ribosomal RNA gene complex, including the 28S ribosomal subunit (D1-D2 region) and the internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 (ITS1 and ITS2 regions). We therefore developed a PCR-based assay to differentiate medically important species of Aspergillus from one another, and from other opportunistic moulds and yeasts, by employing universal, pan-fungal primers directed to conserved ribosomal genes and species-specific DNA probes directed to the highly variable ITS2 region. Amplicons were then detected in a simple, colorimetric enzyme immunoassay format (PCR-EIA). DNA sequencing of the ITS1 and ITS2 regions and of the D1-D2 region was also conducted for the differentiation of species by comparative GenBank sequence analysis. The PCR-EIA method was found to be rapid, sensitive, and specific for the identification and differentiation of the most medically important species of Aspergillus. In addition, methods to identify species of Aspergillus by comparative GenBank sequence analysis were found to be more reliable using the ITS1 and ITS2 regions than the D1-D2 region.",2005,16110805,no
Advances in diagnostic testing.,"Within the past decade surrogate markers have become important and reliable tools for the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. Surrogate markers include the antigens galactomannan and (1 --> 3)-beta-D-glucan for which commercial assays are available, as well as fungal DNA for which experimental PCR assays have been developed. Although many clinical validation studies have been performed, the kinetics of these markers are still largely unknown. Recent studies have addressed several issues related to variables that interact with the performance of the assays, including exposure to mould-active antifungal agents and the interpretive cut-off levels. Insights gained as a result of these studies will help us to further optimize management strategies and to determine the optimal test sequence.",2005,16110803,no
Specific molecular features in the organization and biosynthesis of the cell wall of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"The cell wall of Aspergillus fumigatus is composed of a branched beta1,3 glucan covalently bound to chitin, beta1,3, beta1,4 glucans, and galactomannan, that is embedded in an amorphous cement composed of alpha1,3 glucan, galactomannan and polygalactosamin. The mycelial cell wall of A. fumigatus is very different from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell wall, and in particular lacks beta1,6 glucans and proteins covalently bound to cell wall polysaccharides. The differences in cell wall composition between the mould A. fumigatus and the yeast S. cerevisiae are also reflected at the genomic level where unique features have been identified in A. fumigatus. A single gene codes for the glucan synthase catalytic subumit this finding has lead to the development of a RNAi methodology for the disruption of essential genes in A. fumigatus. In contrast to the glucan synthase, multiple genes have been found in the chitin synthase and the alpha glucan synthase families",2005,16110787,no
Detection of antibodies to phospholipase B in patients infected with Cryptococcus neoformans by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).,"Secreted phospholipases are virulence factors of several fungi, including Cryptococcus neoformans. We describe for the first time the detection by ELISA of antibodies to cryptococcal phospholipase B in the serum of patients infected with C. neoformans or C. gattii. Sixty-nine sera from 25 patients with cryptococcosis, 23 patients with Candida infections and 26 with bacterial or viral infections were tested. The sensitivity of the ELISA in patients with cryptococcosis was 100% in immunocompetent hosts and 64.3% in immunosuppressed patients with cryptococcal meningitis. Absorbance readings were significantly higher in immunocompetent patients (P<0.001). Titres remained positive for up to 2 years. Positive results were noted in 10 episodes of invasive candidiasis, three patients colonised with Candida, and three cases of bacterial infection. Mean absorbance readings were significantly lower in patients with bacterial infection (P <0.001). We conclude that phospholipase B is produced in vivo during cryptococcal infection and that serum phospholipase B antibodies are a sensitive marker of present or past infection. Cross-reactivity of the ELISA with sera from patients with candidiasis indicates that common epitopes are present on cryptococcal and candidal phospholipase B, hence fungal phospholipase B may constitute a new therapeutic target.",2005,16110779,no
Design issues in studies evaluating diagnostic tests for aspergillosis.,"Although invasive aspergillosis is recognized as an increased concern for immunosuppressed patients, establishing an early diagnosis remains a challenge. Current methods for diagnosis, including sensitive radiography and invasive procedures to identify organisms in affected tissues, provide an early diagnosis for only a small proportion of patients infected with Aspergillus species. The availability of a standardized assay to detect circulating Aspergillus galactomannan, the BioRad Platelia Aspergillus galactomannan enzyme immunoassay, should be considered as a valuable tool. However, at present, clinical utility is hampered by controversies surrounding the performance of the test and an apparent lack of definitive data. These controversies emphasize the complexity inherent in analyzing diagnostic tests for aspergillosis. The widespread availability of a standardized assay may now allow us to address the multiple sources of variability and bias via large, cooperative studies.",2005,16108003,no
Arrestin-related proteins mediate pH signaling in fungi.,"Metazoan arrestins bind to seven-transmembrane (7TM) receptors to regulate function. Aspergillus nidulans PalF, a protein involved in the fungal ambient pH signaling pathway, contains arrestin N-terminal and C-terminal domains and binds strongly to two different regions within the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the 7TM, putative pH sensor PalH. Upon exposure to alkaline ambient pH, PalF is phosphorylated and, like mammalian beta-arrestins, ubiquitinated in a signal-dependent and 7TM protein-dependent manner. Substitution in PalF of a highly conserved arrestin N-terminal domain Ser residue prevents PalF-PalH interaction and pH signaling in vivo. Thus, PalF is the first experimentally documented fungal arrestin-related protein, dispelling the notion that arrestins are restricted to animal proteomes. Epistasis analyses demonstrate that PalF posttranslational modification is partially dependent on the 4TM protein PalI but independent of the remaining pH signal transduction pathway proteins PalA, PalB, and PalC, yielding experimental evidence bearing on the order of participation of the six components of the pH signal transduction pathway. Our data strongly implicate PalH as an ambient pH sensor, possibly with the cooperation of PalI.",2005,16099830,no
"Functional, biochemical, and pathological effects of repeated oral administration of ochratoxin A to rats.","Ochratoxin A (OTA), a mycotoxin produced by several fungi of Aspergillus and Penicillium species, may contaminate agricultural products, resulting in chronic human exposure. In rats, OTA is a potent nephrotoxin, and repeated administration of OTA for 2 years to rats in doses up to 0.21 mg/kg of body wt resulted in high incidences of renal tumors arising from the proximal tubular epithelial cells. The mechanism of tumor formation by OTA in the kidney is not well-defined, and controversial results regarding mode of action have been published. The aim of this study was to characterize dose-dependent changes induced by OTA by application of clinical chemistry, biochemical markers, and toxicokinetics for a better conclusion on modes of action. Administration of OTA (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/kg of body wt) to male F344 rats (n = 3 per group) by oral gavage for 2 weeks resulted in a dose-dependent increase in OTA plasma concentrations and concentrations of OTA in both liver and kidney. Although oxidative stress has been implicated in OTA carcinogenicity, treatment with OTA did not induce overt lipid peroxidation or an increase in 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) in kidney. In the kidney, OTA-induced pathology was present at all dose levels administered, with a clear increase in severity related to dose. Pathology was restricted to the outer stripe of the outer medulla and consisted of disorganization of the tubule arrangement, frequent apoptotic cells, and abnormally enlarged nuclei scattered through the S3 tubules. Consistent with the histopathology, a dose-dependent increase in the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), indicative of cell proliferation, was observed in kidneys, but not in livers of treated animals. The most prominent change in the composition of urine induced by OTA analyzed by 1H NMR and principal component analysis consisted of a major increase in the excretion of trimethylamine N-oxide. However, typical changes observed with other proximal tubular toxins such as increased excretion of glucose were not observed at any of the doses administered. Similarly, treatment with OTA had no clear effects on clinical chemical parameters indicative of nephrotoxicity, although urinary volume was increased at the higher-dose groups. Taken together, the uncommon changes induced by OTA suggest that a unique mechanism may be involved in OTA nephrotoxicity and carcinogenicity.",2005,16097797,no
Diagnosis and successful treatment of a presumptive case of aspergillosis in a Micronesian kingfisher (Halcyon cinnamomina cinnamomina).,"A 4-yr-old male Micronesian kingfisher was suspected of having an aspergillus infection. The infection was thought to be related to stress associated with movement to a new enclosure/exhibit and cage-mate aggression. The diagnosis was based on an elevated white cell count, positive antibody and antigen aspergillus titers, and abnormal plasma protein electrophoresis characterized by a moderate elevation of alpha2 and severe elevation on the beta protein fractions. The bird was treated with antifungal medication administered systemically and by nebulization for 10 wk. Response to treatment was monitored by serial white cell counts and plasma electrophoresis. Clinical improvement in this bird was correlated with a return of the white blood cell count to normal levels and what was considered a normal protein electrophoresis distribution.",2005,16094842,no
A microtubule associated protein (hNUDC) binds to the extracellular domain of thrombopoietin receptor (Mpl).,"Human NUDC (hNUDC) was initially characterized as a nuclear migration protein based on the similarity of its C-terminus to that of fungal NUDC from Aspergillus nidulans. However, hNUDC is a 331 amino acid protein whereas fungal NUDC is 198 amino acids in length. The extra N-terminal portion of hNUDC has no known function or homology to other proteins. In this study, we report the binding of hNUDC to the extracellular domain of the thrombopoietin receptor (Mpl) as detected by the yeast two-hybrid system, GST pull-down, and co-immunoprecipitation. Our deletion analysis demonstrated that amino acids between positions 100 and 238 as the critical domain mediating the hNUDC and Mpl interactions as detected by the two-hybrid system and GST pull-down assay. Immunofluorescence staining of human megakaryocyte cells indicated that hNUDC and Mpl colocalized at all stages of megakaryocyte development. Substantial colocalization of hNUDC with microtubules was also detected around nuclei and elongated microtubular structures, especially in proplatelet extensions.",2005,16088917,no
Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.,"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is the most common fungal pulmonary infection in severely immunocompromised patients. Aspergillus species are commonly isolated from the soil, plant debris, and the indoor environment, including the hospital. Phagocytosis is the main host defense against Aspergillus conidia and hyphae. The diagnosis of IPA is based on clinical, radiological, and mycological data. Clinical signs have a low specificity. The most typical computed tomographic (CT) findings are nodules with or without the halo sign or the air crescent sign. Sensitivity of microscopy and culture of noninvasive collected samples is low. Galactomannan and nucleic acid detection in serum or in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid help to confirm the diagnosis. Crude mortality is high and strongly correlated with the underlying condition, stage of the underlying disease, and extension of the aspergillosis. Optimal therapeutic strategies include the prevention of contamination in patients at high risk, early initiation of antifungal therapy, surgery in some instances, and, importantly, treatment of the underlying condition to restore whenever possible a certain degree of immunocompetence. Voriconazole has demonstrated better efficacy and safety than amphotericin B deoxycholate. The improved survival observed with voriconazole makes it a new reference for the first-line therapy of IA. Lipid formulations of amphotericin B, caspofungin, micafungin, and posaconazole are other therapeutic options in the event of failure of or contraindication to voriconazole. The main indication for surgery is prevention of severe hemoptysis when the lesion is adjacent to a large vessel.",2005,16088462,no
Coccidioidomycosis.,"Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection caused by Coccidiodes. The fungus has a limited geographic distribution but the disease can be seen anywhere. Primary infection is usually self-limited however, when a large dose of fungus is inhaled or in an immunosuppressed host, the patient may develop overwhelming infection, including ARDS, in a brief period. While serodiagnosis can help to suspect the diagnosis, particularly in the setting of overwhelming disease, diagnostic efforts should focus on identifying the organism in body fluids or tissues. Several treatment options are available. Amphotericin B was the drug of choice for decades when there were no alternatives. Triazoles, fluconazole and itraconazole, are very effective and much less toxic.",2005,16088456,no
Decreased circulating elastin peptide levels in humans with sepsis.,"Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening medical condition induced by viral, bacterial or fungal infection, which is characterized by systemic inflammation, hypotension and vasodilation that can lead to cardiovascular collapse. Increased activity of elastases, enzymes which degrade the extracellular matrix components including elastin, has been demonstrated in plasma of septic patients. Since elastin peptides (EP), by binding to an elastin-laminin receptor on vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, induce dose-dependent vasodilation, we hypothesized that elevated circulating EP could contribute to the vasodilation that occurs in septic patients.Blood for measurement of EP was collected from not-septic and septic patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), as well as from healthy subjects. Plasma EP concentrations were measured using a competitive ELISA technique.The plasma EP level in the septic patients was approximately half that of the not-septic patients and the healthy controls, with similar EP levels in the latter two groups. There was no apparent association between EP levels and age or gender in any of the groups.Plasma EP levels were actually decreased in septic patients, possibly indicating that the balance between EP production vs. elimination favors elimination. This result further suggests that circulating EP may not be important in the development of the vasodilation and hypotension that occurs in septic shock. Alternatively, however, increased degradation of EP by elastase or other enzymes could lead to the appearance of biologically active EP, which may not be recognized by the ELISA assay.",2005,16085122,no
Bifidobacterial lipoglycan as a new cause for false-positive platelia Aspergillus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reactivity.,"We previously hypothesized that a lipoglycan of Bifidobacterium bifidum subsp. pennsylvanicum cross-reacts with the Platelia Aspergillus (PA) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the presence of galactofuranosyl epitopes in the cell wall (M. A. S. H. Mennink-Kersten, R. R. Klont, A. Warris, H. J. M. Op den Camp, and P. E. Verweij, Lancet 363:325-327, 2004). We tested this hypothesis by testing bacterial suspensions of different bifidobacterial species and other gram-positive and -negative bacteria with the PA ELISA, which is used to detect circulating galactomannan for the serodiagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. Furthermore, neonatal fecal samples were enumerated for bifidobacteria by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and tested for PA ELISA reactivity. All bifidobacteria, except B. infantis and B. adolescentis, showed reactivity 6- to 600-fold higher compared to the controls (i.e., Micrococcus luteus and Propionibacterium freudenreichii, which contain a cell wall lipomannan). Eggerthella lenta showed a 25-fold-higher reactivity. ELISA reactivity was clearly shown to be associated with bacterial lipoglycans containing a beta-1,5-galactofuranosyl chain. All neonatal feces showed PA ELISA reactivity and associated numbers of bifidobacteria. Since high concentrations of bifidobacteria are present in the human gut, these bacteria or excreted lipoglycan may cause false serum PA ELISA reactivity in selected patient groups, especially neonates.",2005,16081932,no
A synthetic peptide (P-21) derived from asp-hemolysin inhibits the induction of macrophage proliferation by oxidized low-density lipoprotein.,"Macrophage-derived foam cells play an important role in atherosclerotic lesions. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL) induces macrophage proliferation via the specific uptake of lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) of OxLDL by class A, type I and type II macrophage scavenger receptors. We have previously shown that Asp-hemolysin from Aspergillus fumigatus binds to LysoPC as a typical lipid moiety of OxLDL. This study investigated the effect of the Asp-hemolysin-related peptide (P-21), a synthetic peptide derived from a region of Asp-hemolysin that is rich in positive charges, on macrophage proliferation induced by OxLDL. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were used for proliferation study. OxLDL induced macrophage proliferation in an oxidation time-dependent manner, and P-21 inhibited OxLDL-induced macrophage proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the binding analysis of P-21 to OxLDL by dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluorometric immunoassay indicated that P-21 binds to OxLDL. These results indicate that P-21 inhibits the OxLDL-induced macrophage proliferation through binding of P-21 to OxLDL.",2005,16079478,no
Fungal antigens expressed during invasive aspergillosis.,"Rabbits that had been infected intravenously with conidiospores of Aspergillus fumigatus were used as sources of antibody for screening a lambda phage cDNA expression library. The cDNA was derived from A. fumigatus mRNA that had been extracted from newly formed, germling hyphae. Thirty-six antigens were identified using antisera from six rabbits. Though many of these antigens were expected to be intracellular proteins because their genes did not encode a signal sequence, the antisera showed consistently a stronger immunoblot reaction with a cell fraction enriched for the fungal cell wall than with a fraction of predominantly intracellular components. Antibodies to eight antigens, including the glycosylhydrolase Asp f 16, were produced by more than one rabbit. In current vaccine studies, Asp f 16 is the only single antigen which has been reported to be capable of inducing protection against invasive aspergillosis in mice. Enolase and Aspergillus HSP90 were detected also their homologues in Candida albicans have been tested as vaccines and have been reported to provide a partially protective response against invasive candidiasis in mice. The Aspergillus antigens reported here may have value both in diagnostic tests for different forms of aspergillosis and as vaccine candidates for protection against invasive disease.",2005,16040983,no
Aspergillus cyclooxygenase-like enzymes are associated with prostaglandin production and virulence.,"Oxylipins comprise a family of oxygenated fatty acid-derived signaling molecules that initiate critical biological activities in animals, plants, and fungi. Mammalian oxylipins, including the prostaglandins (PGs), mediate many immune and inflammation responses in animals. PG production by pathogenic microbes is theorized to play a role in pathogenesis. We have genetically characterized three Aspergillus genes, ppoA, ppoB, and ppoC, encoding fatty acid oxygenases similar in sequence to specific mammalian prostaglandin synthases, the cyclooxygenases. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis showed that production of PG species is decreased in both Aspergillus nidulans and A. fumigatus ppo mutants, implicating Ppo activity in generating PGs. The A. fumigatus triple-ppo-silenced mutant was hypervirulent in the invasive pulmonary aspergillosis murine model system and showed increased tolerance to H(2)O(2) stress relative to that of the wild type. We propose that Ppo products, PG, and/or other oxylipins may serve as activators of mammalian immune responses contributing to enhanced resistance to opportunistic fungi and as factors that modulate fungal development contributing to resistance to host defenses.",2005,16040966,no
Experimental systemic murine aspergillosis: treatment with polyene and caspofungin combination and G-CSF.,"In view of the poor therapy outcomes of invasive aspergillosis, the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of combination treatment consisting of the polyene amphotericin-B-intralipid, the echinocandin caspofungin and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) in experimental murine systemic aspergillosis. With inhibition of synthesis of 1,3-beta-d-glucan in the fungal cell wall by caspofungin and an effect on the cell membrane by amphotericin-B-intralipid, this treatment may result in a synergic effect against Aspergillus fumigatus. Addition of G-CSF may further contribute to therapy of aspergillosis.ICR mice were immunosuppressed by intraperitoneal administration of cyclophosphamide. Three days later, the mice were inoculated intravenously (iv) with A. fumigatus conidia. Infection and treatment were evaluated during an observation period of 30 days in terms of mortality (survival rate and mean survival time) and morbidity (quantitative determination of fungal burden, histopathology, and detection of serum galactomannan).Combination of caspofungin + G-CSF or addition of G-CSF to the combination of caspofungin + amphotericin-B-intralipid increased the survival rate of infected mice up to 78.9% and prolonged their mean survival time to 25 days. These combinations also resulted in a reduction in fungal burden in organs, and a decrease in serum galactomannan.The successful results obtained in the experimental model may possibly open the way to more effective management of aspergillosis in humans.",2005,16006446,no
Galactomannoproteins of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Galactofuranose-containing molecules have been repeatedly shown to be important antigens among human fungal pathogens, including Aspergillus fumigatus. Immunogenic galactofuran determinants have been poorly characterized chemically, however. We reported here the characterization of two glycoproteins of A. fumigatus with an N-glycan containing galactofuranose. These proteins are a phospholipase C and a phytase. Chemical characterization of the N-glycan indicates that it is a mixture of Hex(5-13)HexNAc(2) oligosaccharides, the major molecular species corresponding to Hex(6-8)HexNAc(2). The N-glycan contained one galactofuranose unit that was in a terminal nonreducing position attached to the 2 position of Man. This single terminal nonreducing galactofuranose is essential for the immunoreactivity of the N-glycans assessed either with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a tetra-beta-1,5-galactofuran chain of galactomannan or with Aspergillus-infected patient sera.",2005,16002656,no

Dialysate tested negative for galactomannan, demonstrating the inability of treatments such as hemodialysis to clear Aspergillus antigen from serum.

Clinical microbiology and infectious diseases. Management of fungal infections.,"Invasive fungal infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. Despite remarkable progress in mycology, many uncertainties and difficulties remain. Invasive fungal infections are difficult to diagnose. Noninvasive, rapid diagnostic tools, such as the detection of Aspergillus galactomannan antigen in serum or of fungal nucleic acids by molecular methods are promising, but are still under investigation. The other difficulty in diagnosis is the lack of standard, consistent criteria. Very recently, diagnostic criteria based on host factors, as well as clinical features and microbiological results, have been proposed. Treatment of invasive fungal infections is also problematic. The development of novel antifungal compounds constitutes a major advance in antifungal therapy. These include novel azoles such as voriconazole (Pfizer), posaconazole (Schering- Plough), and ravuconazole (Eisai/Bristol-Myers Squibb), and novel echinocandins such as caspofungin (Merck), anidulafungin (Eli Lilly), and micafungin (Fujisawa Pharmaceutical). These agents appear more efficacious and less toxic than currently available antifungal drugs. However, immune status of the host remains one of the major determinants of clinical outcome. This property limits the efficiency of in vitro antifungal susceptibility tests in predicting in vivo outcome. Using immune system modifiers such as cytokines in combination with antifungal agents is beneficial in the improvement of immune status, and thus clinical outcome.",2005,15995924,no
Changing face of health-care associated fungal infections.,"The purpose of this review was to evaluate recent publications on the epidemiology, diagnosis and management of invasive fungal infections.Epidemiological surveys have highlighted significant differences between Europe and the United States regarding the incidence and etiology of Candida bloodstream infections. Today, invasive aspergillosis is occurring in a much broader patient population than the classical immunocompromised hosts and includes mechanically ventilated intensive care unit patients and patients receiving corticosteroids for treatment of chronic lung diseases. Diagnosis is often delayed in these patients and prognosis is dismal. Measurement of galactomannan, mannan and antimannan antibodies, and beta-(1-3)-D-glucan may help to speed up diagnosis. The epidemiology of invasive mold infections is changing. The frequency of non-fumigatus Aspergillus species is increasing, uncommon hyalo-or phaeo-hyphomycoses are emerging and breakthrough mold infections intrinsically resistant to azoles have been reported. Clinical trials have shown that new azoles and echinocandins are as efficacious as amphotericin B or fluconazole for the treatment of eosophageal or invasive candidiasis, for prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in transplant patients, or for empirical antifungal therapy in patients with persistent fever and neutropenia.Recent data suggest that the epidemiology of invasive fungal infections may be changing with the emergence of uncommon molds and the occurrence of invasive aspergillosis in 'nonclassical' immunocompromised hosts. New diagnostic tools and improved antifungal agents are available to facilitate early diagnosis and offer new treatment options.",2005,15985827,no
The contribution of galactomannan detection in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in bone marrow transplant recipients.,"Until recently, accurate microbiological diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) was seldom established in HSCT recipients. Blood samples are rarely positive for Aspergillus species, the reliability of the cultures depends of the specimen (if taken from a normally sterile site or not) and biopsy samples require invasive procedures, rarely recommended in patients with severe thrombocytopenia. Implementing the international consensus defining the microbiological criteria for the diagnosis of Aspergillus infection, we retrospectively evaluated the role of serum galactomannan (GM) detection by EIA to diagnose IA among HSCT patients with proven invasive fungal infection (IFI) and the impact of serum storage in GM concentrations. The EIA assay allowed categorizing as ""probable"" 5 of the 10 cases of ""possible"" aspergillosis (50%). Considering a lower cut-off level for the reaction (1.0), 80% of the cases could be categorized as ""probable"" aspergillosis. Positive or undetermined results were detected one to 4 months before the diagnosis of IA in eight of the 11 patients (72.7%) with proven IFI. Retesting the stored samples after a second storage for four years, we could observe lower reactivity in 20% of the samples. The detection of galactomannan by the EIA test represents a major advance in the diagnosis of IA in HSCT recipients at high risk of IA. A better understanding of the kinetics of the GM in different clinical situations is necessary to maximize the benefit of the test in Aspergillus surveillance.",2005,15983733,no
Cryptococcus neoformans Galactoxylomannan contains an epitope(s) that is cross-reactive with Aspergillus Galactomannan.,"We report a case of cryptococcosis in which a serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for Aspergillus galactomannan was positive, with no evidence of aspergillosis. Soluble antigens from 19 Cryptococcus neoformans strains and purified carbohydrates of C. neoformans capsule were thus assayed in the Aspergillus galactomannan ELISA. Antigens from all C. neoformans strains, and purified galactoxylomannan, gave a positive reaction, suggesting that C. neoformans galactoxylomannan contains an epitope(s) that is cross-reactive with Aspergillus galactomannan.",2005,15956422,no
Fatal pulmonary infection in a leukaemic patient caused by Hormographiella aspergillata.,"A case of autopsy-proven fungal pneumonia in a relapsed leukaemia patient is reported. The fungus Hormographiella aspergillata was cultured from two bronchoalveolar fluid samples and identified through morphological examination and ITS2 sequence analysis. In addition, galactomannan was detected in eight consecutive serum samples, which suggested a co-infection with Aspergillus species. The patient was treated with caspofungin.",2005,15947435,no
Class I and class II chitin synthases are involved in septum formation in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans.,"The class II and class I chitin synthases of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans are encoded by chsA and chsC, respectively. Previously, we presented several lines of evidence suggesting that ChsA and ChsC have overlapping functions in maintaining cell wall integrity. In order to determine the functions of these chitin synthases, we employed electron and fluorescence microscopy and investigated in detail the cell wall of a DeltachsA DeltachsC double mutant (DeltaAC mutant) along with the localization of ChsA and ChsC. In the lateral cell wall of the DeltaAC mutant, electron-transparent regions were thickened. Septa of the DeltaAC mutant were aberrantly thick and had a large pore. Some septa were located abnormally close to adjacent septa. A functional hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ChsA (HA-ChsA) and a functional FLAG-tagged ChsC (FLAG-ChsC) were each localized to a subset of septation sites. Comparison with the localization pattern of actin, which is known to localize at forming septa, suggested that ChsA and ChsC transiently exist at the septation sites during and shortly after septum formation. Double staining of HA-ChsA and FLAG-ChsC indicated that their localizations were not identical but partly overlapped at the septation sites. Fluorescence of FLAG-ChsC, but not of HA-ChsA, was also observed at hyphal tips. These data indicate that ChsA and ChsC share overlapping roles in septum formation.",2005,15947204,no
Preparation and characterization of a monoclonal antibody against mannoprotein of Candida albicans.,"BALB/c mice were immunized via injection with whole cell of Candida albicans serotype A. The spleens were fused with myeloma cells of SP2/0 origin. A mannoprotein-reactive monoclonal antibody (MAb) was selected and characterized by ELISA technique. This MAb reacted with strains of Candida such as C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. albicans of the Persian Type Culture Collection (PTCC). However, our antibody did not react with other Candida species such as C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, C. stellatoidae, C. lusitania, C. krusei, and S. cervisiae. These antibodies also did not recognize extracts of other fungal species such as Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus flavus, and bacterial strains such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Polyclonal antibody produced in this study could not differentiate the above species and was reactive towards all fungal species mentioned above except bacterial strains of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Western blot analysis of ligand affinity-purified mannoproteins of C. albicans wall protein using this MAb showed reactivity toward a single protein band in the region of 55-65 kDa molecular weight. The same antibody, when examined with unpurified C. albicans extract, reacted with a broad band in the region of 55-105 kDa, which we concluded was due to a possible different glycosylation pattern of mannoprotein in crude extract in which the higher molecular weight protein was eliminated by ligand-binding affinity purification.",2005,15943562,no
Evaluation of serum sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for circulating galactomannan during caspofungin therapy: results from the caspofungin invasive aspergillosis study.,There has been minimal clinical experience with the use of the Aspergillus galactomannan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for patients receiving echinocandin therapy. We reviewed the experience with the galactomannan ELISA for 17 patients in a study of caspofungin treatment for invasive aspergillosis. The rate of successful outcomes for these patients was similar to that overall for participants in the study. Trends in antigenemia levels correlated with clinical and radiographic findings.,2005,15937754,no
[Management of aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients. Recommendations of Lille University Hospital--4th version--November 2004].,"Invasive aspergillosis is a severe complication in immunocompromised patients. The arrival of new antifungal agents motivated the redaction of guidelines, regularly updated, by a Lille University hospital multidisciplinary task force. These guidelines assess diagnostic and therapeutic issues. The main recommended diagnosis tool is the chest CT scan, ordered at the smallest suspicion and, also, measure of the blood and broncho alveolar lavage fluid galactomannan. Treatment guidelines assess prophylaxis, empirical and documented therapy. Primary prophylaxis is warranted in only two cases, pulmonary graft or stem cell transplant in patients with chronic GVH and receiving corticosteroids. Empirical therapy should use one of the available amphotericin B formulations, chosen according to the patient history. Caspofungin is another choice. Documented therapy, depending on presentation, can be a single drug or a combination. First line therapy for single drug is i.v. voriconazole. Lipid formulations of amphotericin B are another choice. A combination therapy can be used as a first line treatment, for multiple lesions, or as salvage therapy. It must include caspofungin, associated with liposomal amphotericin B or voriconazole. A tight cooperation with thoracic surgeons is recommended.",2005,15911182,no
The production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies to the fungus Aspergillus versicolor.,"Fungal exposure measurements in indoor environments require accurate and precise monitoring methods. Such techniques may be based on monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and here we report the cross-reactivity patterns of Mabs produced against Aspergillus versicolor. Balb/c mice were immunized with the particulate fraction of homogenized spores and 46 Mabs (35 IgM, nine IgG3, two IgG1) were produced and tested for cross-reactivity against 55 fungal species. None of the Mabs was found to be species-specific for A. versicolor. Several Mabs strongly cross-reacted with most Aspergillus, Penicillium and Eurotium species and some Mabs also cross-reacted with Paecilomyces variotii and several Cladosporium and Stachybotrys species. Our results show that antibody responses in mice against spores of A. versicolor are dominated by highly cross-reactive antibodies of the IgM isotype. The widespread cross-reactivity suggests that the specificity of antibodies to be used for the detection of fungi in environmental samples need to be thoroughly characterized in order to avoid ambiguities in the interpretation of monitoring results. Furthermore, accurate estimates of spore concentrations may require the application of species-specific Mabs in order to avoid bias in result interpretation because of the differential reactivity of cross-reactive Mabs with different fungi.Producers of monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies for the detection of fungi in environmental or clinical samples need to verify antibody reactivity patterns and accurately report that information to potential users. Furthermore, immunoassays based on mouse or human serum or purified immunoglobulin fractions need to consider antibody cross-reactivity as a potential confounding factor during interpretation of results.",2005,15910525,no
Antifungal therapy decreases sensitivity of the Aspergillus galactomannan enzyme immunoassay.,"Reported sensitivity of the galactomannan enzyme immunoassay as an early diagnostic test for invasive aspergillosis (IA) has been widely variable, ranging from 29% to 100% in earlier clinical studies.Studies performed to date have analyzed performance using per-patient calculations, limiting their ability to measure the impact of clinical variables that change over time, such as receipt of preventive antifungal therapy. In our study, performance of the test was calculated in per-patient and per-test analyses in a large cohort of patients at high risk for IA from 2 North American centers. A total of 272 serum samples obtained from 46 patients with IA and 3005 serum samples obtained from 269 control patients were analyzed using multiple index cutoff values to define positivity.Per-patient calculations yielded sensitivities of 43% and 70% using index cutoff values of 1.5 and 0.5, respectively specificity decreased from 93% with use of the 1.5 index cutoff to 70% with use of the 0.5 index cutoff. Per-test calculations yielded sensitivities of 31% and 59% and specificities of 99% and 92% using index cutoff values of 1.5 and 0.5, respectively. Receipt of mold-active antifungal drugs on the day of testing decreased sensitivityThese findings have direct implications for preventive strategies, because the diagnostic utility of the antigen assay is compromised during receipt of prophylactic or empirical antifungal therapies.",2005,15909264,no
"Identification of immunogenic proteins from Paracoccidioides brasiliensis antigenic fractions F0, FII and FIII.","Paracoccidioides brasiliensis causes a chronic granulomatous mycosis prevalent in South America, and cell-mediated immunity is the principal mode of protection against this fungal infection. In this context, one of the strategies to discover proteins that are target of an effective immune response against P. brasiliensis is the partial sequencing of cDNA from an expression library previously screened with immunoglobulins (Ig) to generate antigen sequence tags (AST). In the present work, a P. brasiliensis yeast cDNA expression library was screened with affinity chromatography-purified IgG from rabbit sera immunized with P. brasiliensis antigenic fractions (F0, FII or FIII) or from paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) patient sera by indirect ELISA. From 119 clones selected by the immunoscreening procedure, 40% were recognized by IgG from PCM patients, 25% were recognized by anti-F0, 8% were selected by anti-FII and 11% recognized by FIII specific antibodies. The remaining clones presented cross-reaction to all anti-sera tested. The AST homologies with previously reported sequences in the nonredundant GenBank at NCBI revealed high significant homology to fungal proteins of known function. One of them matched calcineurin B of Neurospora crassa with 35% identity and 55% similarity in amino acid sequence. We also identified an AST homologous to a Kinesin like protein from Ustilagus maydis and other fungi with 86% identity and 91% similarity. On the other hand, the vast majority of selected cDNA clones are new genes and represent 60% of the total. Prediction of transmembrane regions with the prediction transmembrane protein topology with a hidden markov model (TMHMM) revealed consensus sequences representing structural membrane segments in 28 encoded proteins.",2005,15904973,no
An immunohistochemical study of canine nasal aspergillosis.,"In this study, histochemistry and immunohistochemistry were used to characterize the phenotype and distribution of leucocytes in the distal nasal mucosa of 15 dogs with nasal aspergillosis. The most consistent histopathological finding was a severe, predominantly lymphoplasmacytic, inflammatory infiltration of the lamina propria. Fungal hyphae were not observed to invade the mucosa but were found at the mucosal surface and within material collected from the nasal cavity. The main immunohistochemical findings were (1) a predominance of IgG(+) plasma cells over IgA(+) and IgM(+) plasma cells, (2) significant numbers of macrophages and dendritic cells expressing MHC class II molecules, (3) macrophages and neutrophils expressing L1 antigen and (4) a mixture of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. These findings are consistent with a dominant Th1-regulated cell-mediated immune response. The nature of the inflammatory infiltrate and the lack of invasiveness of the mucosa by the fungus, together with the clinical course of the disease and the apparent immunocompetence of the affected dogs, suggest that canine nasal aspergillosis resembles the chronic erosive non-invasive fungal sinusitis described in human patients.",2005,15893986,no
Blood culture-negative endocarditis in a reference center: etiologic diagnosis of 348 cases.,"To identify the current etiologies of blood culture-negative infective endocarditis and to describe the epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic characteristics associated with each etiology, as well as with unexplained cases, we tested samples from 348 patients suspected of having blood culture-negative infective endocarditis in our diagnostic center, the French National Reference Center for Rickettsial Diseases, between 1983 and 2001.

"Comparison of non-culture-based methods for detection of systemic fungal infections, with an emphasis on invasive Candida infections.","The accepted limitations associated with classic culture techniques for the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections have lead to the emergence of many non-culture-based methods. With superior sensitivities and quicker turnaround times, non-culture-based methods may aid the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections. In this review of the diagnostic service, we assessed the performances of two antigen detection techniques (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and latex agglutination) with a molecular method for the detection of invasive Candida infection and invasive aspergillosis. The specificities for all three assays were high (> or = 97%), although the Candida PCR method had enhanced sensitivity over both ELISA and latex agglutination with values of 95%, 75%, and 25%, respectively. However, calculating significant sensitivity values for the Aspergillus detection methods was not feasible due to a low number of proven/probable cases. Despite enhanced sensitivity, the PCR method failed to detect nucleic acid in a probable case of invasive Candida infection that was detected by ELISA. In conclusion, both PCR and ELISA techniques should be used in unison to aid the detection of invasive fungal infections.",2005,15872239,yes
Central nervous system fungal infection--a report of three cases.,"Fungal infections of the central nervous system in three apparently immunocompetent patients are being reported. Two cases of cerebral aspergillosis presenting as intracranial granulomas such as rhinocerebral and intracranial forms, and one of cryptococcal meningitis could be successfully diagnosed by newer diagnostic modality such as antigen detection techniques. The case with cryptococcal infection had typical neuroimaging feature which helped to suspect the underlying diagnosis.

IgE-mediated and T cell-mediated autoimmunity against manganese superoxide dismutase in atopic dermatitis.,"Autoreactivity of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) to human proteins has been postulated as a decisive pathogenetic factor for AD.In this study, it was investigated whether the stress-inducible enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) of human and fungal origin might act as an autoallergen in atopic dermatitis.Patients with AD (n = 69 mean SCORAD [SCORing Atopic Dermatitis], 27) and other inflammatory skin diseases as well as with inhalant allergies were investigated. The presence of specific IgE against recombinant MnSOD of fungal and human origin and the fungal extracts of Aspergillus fumigatus and Malassezia sympodialis was measured by CAP, ELISA, skin prick test, and in subset of patients also by atopy patch tests (APTs) and PBMC proliferation assays. Cross-reactivity between allergens was determined by CAP inhibition. The presence of MnSOD in human skin in various inflammatory skin conditions was investigated by immunohistochemistry.Specific IgE antibodies against human MnSOD correlating with the disease activity were found in 29 out of 67 patients with AD. The human protein was able to induce in vitro T-cell reactivity and eczematous reactions in APT in MnSOD-sensitized patients with AD. MnSOD was upregulated in various inflammatory skin reactions and APT skin specimens. Cosensitization to structurally related and cross-reacting fungal MnSOD and the skin-colonizing yeast M sympodialis was observed in all patients sensitized against human MnSOD.Human MnSOD may play a role as an autoallergen in a subset of patients with AD, including nonatopic eczema. By molecular mimicry leading to cross-reactivity such sensitization might be induced primarily by exposure to environmental fungal MnSOD of M sympodialis .",2005,15867868,no
A novel enzymatic technique for limiting drug mobility in a hydrogel matrix.,"An oral colon specific drug delivery platform has been developed to facilitate targetted release of therapeutic proteins as well as small molecule drugs. A simple enzymatic procedure is used to modify the molecular architecture of a lightly chemically crosslinked galactomannan hydrogel as well as a model drug-galactomannan oligomer conjugate, fluoroisocynate (FITC) tagged guar oligomer, to entrap the model drug. The enzyme-modified hydrogel retains the drug until it reaches the colonic environment where bacteria secrete enzymes (namely beta-mannanase) to degrade the gel and release the drug molecule. Laser scanning confocal microscopy combined with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching is used to quantify the diffusion of the drug conjugate. The diffusion coefficient of solutes in the lightly crosslinked galactomannan hydrogel is approximately equal to the diffusion coefficient in the guar solution for simple diffusional drug loading. After drug loading, alpha-galactosidase treatment generates additional physical crosslinks in the hydrogel matrix as well as between the drug-oligomer conjugate and the hydrogel, which reduces diffusion of the drug-oligomer conjugate significantly. Degradation of the hydrogel by beta-mannanase results in a slow and controlled rate of FITC-guar oligomer diffusion, which generates an extended release profile for the model drug.",2005,15866341,no
Time course of antibody response to recombinant Aspergillus fumigatus antigens in cystic fibrosis with and without ABPA.,"We determined follow-up levels of specific serum IgE to the recombinant Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) allergens rAsp f 1, 3, 4 and 6 in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF) with and without allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). Over a 32-month period follow-up data of 74 patients were collected. According to serology, 11 CF patients were not sensitized (CF controls), 40 were sensitized to A. fumigatus (Asp. f-sens.) and 23 patients fulfilled the serologic criteria for ABPA. Of these 23 ABPA patients 11 expressed the full clinical ABPA picture (classicABPA) and 12 failed to show sufficient relevant clinical signs (seroABPA), despite positive serology. The 23 ABPA patients had 16-18 times higher serum levels of specific IgE to rAsp f 4 and/or rAsp f 6 than those of Asp. f-sens. patients (rAsp f 4: 31.3 +/- 45 EU/ml vs. 1.9 +/- 2.2 EU/ml and rAsp f 6: 39.0 +/- 44.3 EU/ml vs 2.1 +/- 1.7 EU/ml). The combination of increased total serum IgE (>1000 IU/l) and increased specific IgE to rAsp f 4 and/or rAsp f 6 allowed to diagnose classicABPA with 100% specificity and 64% sensitivity and with a high predicted positive (100%) and a high predicted negative (94%) value. During a combined treatment (seven patients) with oral corticosteroid and itraconazole, itraconazole alone (two patients) or neither oral corticosteroid nor itraconazole therapy (two patients) total serum IgE and specific IgE to rAsp f 4 and/or rAsp f 6 did decrease but did not normalize. Over the observation period, lung function remained unchanged, independent of whether oral steroids and/or concomitant itraconazole were either given or not given. In the follow-up of CF patients with ABPA under therapy the determination of total or specific IgE serum levels were of limited value to guide therapy.",2005,15853950,no
Sensitization to Aspergillus antigens and occurrence of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in patients with asthma.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), which is predominantly a disease of asthmatic subjects, is caused by hypersensitivity to Aspergillus antigens. Screening for Aspergillus sensitization in asthmatic subjects could identify those who are at risk for ABPA. Few studies have shown that fungal sensitization could be an important risk factor for asthma severity. We sought to determine the frequency of sensitization to Aspergillus antigens in asthmatic subjects and its effect on disease severity. We also determined the occurrence of ABPA in these subjects.Prospective study of consecutive patients with asthma.Tertiary university referral hospital, outpatient department.One hundred five asthmatic subjects and 26 volunteers underwent skin testing with aeroallergens, including Aspergillus, serum precipitins against Aspergillus antigens, and specific IgG against Aspergillus fumigatus, total serum IgE levels, and routine blood and radiologic investigations. ABPA was diagnosed when all eight major criteria were fulfilled.Thirty patients (28.5%) had a positive skin reactivity to Aspergillus antigens. Eleven patients (10.4%) had positive specific reactions to IgG, and 8 patients (7.6%) demonstrated positive reactions to serum precipitins. Eight of these 30 patients (26.6%) received diagnoses of ABPA, which was 7.6% of the total. None of the control subjects were sensitized to Aspergillus antigens. The patients were classified into the following four groups: negative skin test results positive reactions to aeroallergens other than AspergillusSensitization to the mold Aspergillus increases the severity of asthma.

Pulmonary fungal infections.,"Invasive fungal infections of the lung have historically been associated with an extremely high mortality. This review aims to disseminate the most recent advances in the diagnosis and management of fungal infections of the lung.The number and diversity of immunosuppressed populations are growing rapidly. Transplant immunosuppression is becoming more aggressive early in the posttransplant period, potentially increasing the risk of invasive fungal infections. The galactomannan antigen test and the beta-D-glucan test have emerged as methods of serially monitoring at-risk patients for invasive aspergillosis. Their utility has been established in some neutropenic populations but not in solid organ transplant recipients. In-vitro studies, animal studies, and retrospective human studies support the use of combination antifungal therapy for invasive aspergillosis. Unfortunately no randomized clinical trials exist.Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis will continue to be a major problem in immunocompromised patients in the future. Immense advances in the last 2-3 years are sure to improve outcome. Well-designed multicenter evaluations are still necessary, however, to optimize management as management options widen.",2005,15818187,no
Genes and molecules involved in Aspergillus fumigatus virulence.,"Aspergillus fumigatus causes a wide range of diseases that include mycotoxicosis, allergic reactions and systemic diseases (invasive aspergillosis) with high mortality rates. Pathogenicity depends on immune status of patients and fungal strain. There is no unique essential virulence factor for development of this fungus in the patient and its virulence appears to be under polygenetic control. The group of molecules and genes associated with the virulence of this fungus includes many cell wall components, such as beta-(1-3)-glucan, galactomannan, galactomannanproteins (Afmp1 and Afmp2), and the chitin synthetases (Chs chsE and chsG), as well as others. Some genes and molecules have been implicated in evasion from the immune response, such as the rodlets layer (rodA/hyp1 gene) and the conidial melanin-DHN (pksP/alb1 gene). The detoxifying systems for Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) by catalases (Cat1p and Cat2p) and superoxide dismutases (MnSOD and Cu, ZnSOD), had also been pointed out as essential for virulence. In addition, this fungus produces toxins (14 kDa diffusible substance from conidia, fumigaclavin C, aurasperon C, gliotoxin, helvolic acid, fumagilin, Asp-hemolysin, and ribotoxin Asp fI/mitogilin F/restrictocin), allergens (Asp f1 to Asp f23), and enzymatic proteins as alkaline serin proteases (Alp and Alp2), metalloproteases (Mep), aspartic proteases (Pep and Pep2), dipeptidyl-peptidases (DppIV and DppV), phospholipase C and phospholipase B (Plb1 and Plb2). These toxic substances and enzymes seems to be additive and/or synergistic, decreasing the survival rates of the infected animals due to their direct action on cells or supporting microbial invasion during infection. Adaptation ability to different trophic situations is an essential attribute of most pathogens. To maintain its virulence attributes A. fumigatus requires iron obtaining by hydroxamate type siderophores (ornitin monooxigenase/SidA), phosphorous obtaining (fos1, fos2, and fos3), signal transductional falls that regulate morphogenesis and/or usage of nutrients as nitrogen (rasA, rasB, rhbA), mitogen activated kinases (sakA codified MAP-kinase), AMPc-Pka signal transductional route, as well as others. In addition, they seem to be essential in this field the amino acid biosynthesis (cpcA and homoaconitase/lysF), the activation and expression of some genes at 37 degrees C (Hsp1/Asp f12, cgrA), some molecules and genes that maintain cellular viability (smcA, Prp8, anexins), etc. Conversely, knowledge about relationship between pathogen and immune response of the host has been improved, opening new research possibilities. The involvement of non-professional cells (endothelial, and tracheal and alveolar epithelial cells) and professional cells (natural killer or NK, and dendritic cells) in infection has been also observed.

Cuticle-induced endo/exoacting chitinase CHIT30 from Metarhizium anisopliae is encoded by an ortholog of the chi3 gene.,"The characterization of chitinase genes and enzymes is an important step toward global understanding of the chitinolytic system in entomopathogenic fungi. Chitinase CHIT30 from Metarhizium anisopliae var. anisopliae (strain E6) has both endo- and exochitinase activities and is a potential determinant of pathogenicity. Serum anti-CHIT30 specifically detected this chitinase amongst five isoenzymes shown in glycol-chitin activity gels. Chitinase CHIT30 secretion is upregulated by chitin, tick cuticle and low concentrations of N-acetylglucosamine (0.25%) and is downregulated by both high N-acetylglucosamine (1%) and glucose (1%) concentrations. Chitinase CHIT30 was produced at tick cuticle during fungal infection. The chi3 gene was assigned to code chitinase CHIT30 in M. anisopliae var. anisopliae.",2005,15808943,no
Fungal-specific humoral response in eosinophilic mucus chronic rhinosinusitis.,"An immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated allergic pathogenesis is presumed in allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS), yet extensive polyps and eosinophilic mucus (EM) in the paranasal sinuses may also occur in the absence of allergy. Although a noninvasive fungal pathogenesis is presumed in all chronic rhinosinusitis with EM (EMCRS), fungal-specific nonallergic immune responses have not been thoroughly investigated. We tested the hypothesis that there is a fungal-specific humoral response in EMCRS and that it is not confined to IgE.EMCRS patients were prospectively stratified into subgroups based on the presence or absence of fungi within EM and of fungal-specific systemic IgE. There were 12 AFS, 5 AFS-like, 8 nonallergic fungal eosinophilic sinusitis (NAFES), and 5 nonallergic, nonfungal eosinophilic sinusitis (NANFES) patients.Alternaria alternata and Aspergillus fumigatus-specific serum IgE, IgG, IgM, and IgA was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared with strictly defined healthy and disease-control groups.Fungal-specific IgG (Alternaria alternata P = .0002 Aspergillus fumigatus P = .004), and IgA levels (Alternaria alternata P = .0016Fungal-specific immunity characterized by serum IgG3 and not IgE, distinguished the EMCRS subgroups from control groups regardless of the presence of fungus within EM or of systemic fungal allergy.

Proteomic identification of human neutrophil alpha-defensins in chronic lung allograft rejection.,"Chronic allograft rejection remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in lung transplant recipients. Currently, diagnosis is based on lung biopsies or the presence of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). To identify a biomarker of rejection we performed a proteome survey of archived bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) acquired from lung transplant recipients between 1993 and 1996 using mass spectrometry (MS). A total of 126 BALF samples from 57 individuals were tested. Initial MS assessment revealed numerous differences in a majority of individuals who experienced BOS, but three unusually intense peaks at m/z = 3373, 3444, and 3488. These were identified as human neutrophil peptides 1-3 (HNP). Quantification by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay showed an elevated HNP level (>0.3 ng/microg protein) in 89% of patients who developed BOS2-3 within 15 months, reaching as high as 6% of the total BALF protein. In control patients, 35% demonstrated a slightly elevated HNP level that declined in all who had subsequent BALF available for testing. HNP levels did not correlate with episodes of acute rejection, cytomegalovirus or fungal infection. In conclusion, elevated HNP levels are associated with the onset of BOS and can predate the clinical onset of disease up to 15 months.",2005,15800973,no
[Improved diagnostics in invasive aspergillosis and systematic monitoring in patients at high risk of infection].,"Invasive aspergillosis remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with prolonged and severe immune suppression such as following haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Consensus definitions, which allow categorisation of patients based on diagnostic criteria, are an important improvement in uniform registration of invasive mycoses in clinical trials. Prospective monitoring of high-risk patients for the circulating aspergillus cell-wall component galactomannan, results in earlier diagnosis in two-thirds of patients when compared with conventional diagnostic methods. High-resolution CT (HRCT) enables the lesions characteristic of invasive mycoses to be detected earlier and better than by chest radiograph. In addition, invasive mycoses cause characteristic lesions on the HRCT scan including the halo-sign and the air-crescent sign. The pre-emptive management strategy which combines monitoring of patients for surrogate markers with a HRCT scan appears to be a promising approach to the early identification and treatment of patients with invasive aspergillosis.",2005,15799638,no
Differential expression of cytokines and chemokines in human monocytes induced by lipid formulations of amphotericin B.,"The immunomodulatory effects of liposomal amphotericin B (LAMB), amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC), and amphotericin B colloidal dispersion (ABCD) on mRNA and protein profiles of five cytokines and chemokines expressed by human monocyte-enriched mononuclear leukocytes (MNCs) were comprehensively evaluated by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays they were compared to those of deoxycholate amphotericin B (DAMB). mRNAs of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), and macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta (MIP-1beta) were assessed after treatment of MNCs with each drug for 0.5, 2, 6, and 22 h. The cytokine protein profiles were obtained after incubation of MNCs with the drugs for 2 h (TNF-alpha) or 6 h (all the others). In the mRNA studies, DAMB resulted in an early increase of inflammatory cytokines or chemokines IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, MCP-1, and MIP-1beta (2 to 6 h) and in a late increase of anti-inflammatory IL-1ra (22 h). ABCD showed a general similar trend of inflammatory gene up-regulation. LAMB and ABLC decreased or did not affect IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, whereas ABLC additionally decreased MIP-1beta. In protein measurement studies, DAMB and ABCD up-regulated production of IL-1beta (P < 0.05), decreased the IL-1ra/IL-1beta ratio, and up-regulated the production of MCP-1 and MIP-1beta. In comparison, LAMB and ABLC down-regulated or did not affect the production of these cytokines/chemokines compared to untreated MNCs",2005,15793118,no
Immunobiochemical analysis of cross-reactive glutathione-S-transferase allergen from different fungal sources.,"Clinical observations suggest the presence of cross-reactive allergens. There is a need to identify these cross-reactive allergens to improve the treatment used for allergic disorders. The present study was aimed to identify and characterize a cross-reactive allergenic protein from fungi. Allergen extracts of various fungi viz. Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus fumigatus, Cladosporium herbarum, Curvularia lunata, and Epicoccum purpurascens showed GST enzymatic activity ranging from 0.765 to 1.004 delta340 nm/min/microg where as activity of rGST was 1.123 delta340 nm/min/microg. Immunoblot with GST antibodies showed a band of approximately 26 kDa in all these fungal extracts. Sera of fungal allergy patients showed the presence of IgE antibodies to GST. Rabbit antibodies raised against the fungal extracts reacted with rGST confirming the presence of GST-like protein in these extract. ELISA inhibition using GST antibodies revealed inhibition with C. herbarum, A. alternata, C. lunata, A. fumigatus, and E. purpurascens demonstrating that fungal GST competes for binding to anti-GST. In summary, a GST-like protein was recognized as cross-reactive allergen in these fungal extracts.",2005,15773571,no
Human leukocyte antigen-DR expression on peripheral blood monocytes and the risk of pneumonia in pediatric lung transplant recipients.,"Pneumonia is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality after living lobar lung transplantation (LT). Low levels of human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) expression on peripheral blood monocytes, have been demonstrated to correlate with risk of infection in surgical, trauma, and adult transplant patients. In addition, interleukin (IL)-10 has been shown to be a negative regulator of HLA-DR expression. This study investigates whether HLA-DR expression and serum IL-10 levels correlate with the development of pneumonia after pediatric LT.Thirteen LT recipients were prospectively monitored with blood samples obtained pre-LT (baseline) and post-LT weeks 1-4. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of HLA-DR on CD14+ monocytes was measured by flow cytometry. IL-10 levels were determined by ELISA from frozen serum collected at the same time points as monocyte HLA-DR expression. Correlates of pneumonia were abstracted from the medical record.Monocyte HLA-DR expression declined in 11 of 13 patients in the first week post-LT. Two patients without an initial decline and four others whose HLA-DR expression recovered by week 2 post-LT, did not develop pneumonia or other infection or rejection. Pneumonia was observed in seven patients, six of whom failed to recover their monocyte HLA-DR expression by 2 weeks post-LT. Six of seven patients with pneumonia recovered, and one patient died of aspergillosis. During weeks 1-4, a statistically significant difference was seen in the profile of mean monocyte HLA-DR expression levels, analyzed as percent of baseline, between the patients with and without pneumonia (P=0.002). The greatest difference between groups over time was seen from post-LT weeks 1-2 (P=0.003). In addition, when comparing the values at each week, a significant difference was seen between the two groups at post-LT week 2 (P=0.006) and week 4 (P=0.05). Analysis of IL-10 concentrations revealed that the overall difference between the groups (patients with and without pneumonia) was statistically significant (P=0.014), with a paradoxical positive correlation between HLA-DR expression at post-LT week 4 and IL-10 concentrations.Persistent low monocyte HLA-DR expression was associated with the risk of post-LT pneumonia in these patients. This measurement may be useful for monitoring risk of infection and stratifying patients into higher and lower risk groups. Increased IL-10 levels may be protective for infection in this group of patients. At present it is unknown whether the predictive power of HLA-DR expression is indicative of a global defect in monocytic function or a specific abnormality.",2005,15762932,no
[Diagnosis of nosocomial aspergillosis].,"The diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis is initially based, as in other severe infectious diseases, on clinical grounds.

[Fungal infections in paediatric patients with chronic granulomatous disease].,"Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a primary immunodeficiency resulting from a disfunction of microbial capacity of phagocytes. Patients with this disease show great susceptibility to fungal and bacterial infections. Between 1988 and 1998, five paediatric patients with CGD who acquired mycotic infections were studied at the Paediatric Hospital Prof. Dr. J. P. Garrahan and their clinical and microbiological characteristics were described. The fungal infection appeared at the mean-age of 8.3 years (range: 1.1-17 years). All the patients had fever and lung involvement, three of them had suppurative abscesses of soft tissues. The mycological diagnosis was determined by microscopy, culture of clinical samples and serologic tests. There were three cases of disseminated aspergillosis, two cases of mixed infection: one due to Candida albicans and Nocardia asteroides and the other due to Scedosporium apiospermum and Cladosporium spp. Four out of the 5 patients died because of an infections process beyond control. Our conclusion is that new therapeutic measures must be considered along with the study of emerging pathogens in this group of patients.",2005,15762786,no
[Present and future in the immunodiagnosis of the animal mycoses].,"The problems that exist in the clinical, microbiological, and histopathological diagnosis of animal mycoses establish the necessity to investigate immunological methodologies in the diagnosis of these diseases. In this way, it may be possible to develop easy and fast techniques, allowing early detection of the disease, and efficient therapy. In our laboratory we have developed an indirect ELISA methodology to the diagnosis of aspergillosis in dog, cat, cow, sheep and birds, and dermatophytoses in dog and cat. Our results suggest this kind of technique may be useful not only in the diagnosis of animal mycosis, but in important fields as the elucidation of the fungal pathogenicity or the elaboration of effective vaccines, and with the possible application in human medicine.",2005,15762777,no
[Histopathological diagnosis of mycoses in veterinary pathology].,"Histopathological analysis demonstrates the morphology of the fungi and shows their relationship with tissue lesions, which is a valuable information in the diagnosis of veterinary mycoses, especially in superficial infections where reservoirs make difficult the diagnosis using other techniques. On the other hand, histopathological analysis should be complementary to other methods such as culture, immunohistochemistry, serology, PCR, etc. In this work, the most relevant histopathological features of some of the most common mycoses of domestic animals, some of which have zoonotic potential, are described and their differential diagnosis is discussed. To facilitate the discussion of the differential diagnoses, mycoses have been grouped by the sites of the infections and by the nature of the fungi (dimorphic and filamentous). Mycoses included in the study were 1) Superficial and deep infections: dermatophytosis, dermatophytic pseudomycetoma, eumycotic mycetoma, phaeohyphomycosis and malasezziasis. 2) Systemic mycoses: aspergillosis and zygomycosis. 3) Mycoses due to dimorphic fungi: candidiasis, cryptococcosis, blastomycosis, sporotrichosis, coccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis. 4) Infections by algae and other fungi: protothecosis and pneumocystosis.",2005,15762775,no
Metal ions modulate gene expression and accumulation of the mycotoxins aflatoxin and zearalenone.,"To determine the modulating action of some metal ions (Zn+2, Fe+2, Cu+2) on gene expression of enzymes related to fungal growth and accumulation of the mycotoxins aflatoxin and zearalenone.The effect of the metal ions, as single or mixed treatments, was observed in submerged cultures of toxigenic Aspergillus flavus or Fusarium graminearum, which produce the mycotoxins aflatoxin or zearalenone, respectively. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results showed that the single metals Zn+2 or Cu+2 stimulated aflatoxin accumulation while Cu+2 or Fe+2 stimulated zearalenone in fungal cultures. Single Zn+2 treatment also affected conidial differentiation and pigmentation. A cDNA suppression subtractive library was also produced and followed by sequencing of potential metal treatment-specific clones, thus determining induced genes. The genes uncovered included enzymes and regulators of cell growth and division, including many genes with unknown functions were uncovered. A Northern blot analysis was used to verify the expression pattern of the corresponding genes under metal treatment. The metal ions enhanced the expression of alcohol dehydrogenase Adh1 homologue by up to 33-fold in A. flavus and ca fourfold in F. graminearum. Encoding homologues of a neutral amino acid permease, were also used in the Northern analysis. However, the expression of the permease was not significantly affected by metal ion treatments.The results showed a significant effect of metal ions on expression of gene related to fungal growth, development, conidiation and production of both aflatoxin and zearalenone.At the molecular and cellular level, the significant effects of metal ions on fungal growth and development, conidiation, and production of both aflatoxin and zearalenone were demonstrated.",2005,15715862,no
Application of nucleic acid sequence-based amplification for diagnosis of and monitoring the clinical course of invasive aspergillosis in patients with hematologic diseases.,"We evaluated nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) and a galactomannan enzyme immunosorbent assay (GM-EIA) for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in neutropenic febrile patients and for monitoring of its clinical course and outcome. Blood samples were collected twice per week from 128 patients with hematologic diseases during periods of neutropenic fever after undergoing chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. A total of 448 blood samples were tested.There were 14 patients with IA (2 patients with proven IA and 12 with probable IA). The median index of the initial NASBA in the IA group was more than 10-fold higher than that in the non-IA group. Galactomannan antigenemia (index, >0.5) was detected with a sensitivity of 86%. In receiver-operator characteristic analysis, the cutoff index of NASBA for the presumptive diagnosis of IA was determined to be 5.0. Combination of these 2 parameters (either a GM-EIA index of >or=0.5 or a NASBA index of >or=5.0) improved the sensitivity of diagnosis to 100%. There was a close relationship between patient outcome and the kinetics of NASBA values: failure of negative conversion during treatment resulted in death in almost all cases.If either GM-EIA or NASBA results suggest IA, the diagnostic yield for IA could be improved, and NASBA could be a useful marker for predicting the clinical course and outcome of treatment.",2005,15668862,yes
[Early signals of systemic mycoses--guidelines for therapeutic decisions?].,"Clinical applications and in vitro studies show that all antimycotics are most effective against infection when applied as early as possible. An early diagnosis is, therefore, essential. At this time for aspergillosis and particularly candidosis, a statement is only possible by combining several diagnostic methods. Inflammatory parameters like procalcitonin, C-reactive protein and proinflammatory cytokines are most important evidence of infection. Antigen tests are more significant by higher sensitivity. Attention should be focused on the detection of mannan by ELISA test, beta-glucan and D-arabinitol. Given the present research level in the field of proteomics, the diagnostic importance of transmembranal receptor proteins or other regulatory proteins seems promising.",2005,15667367,no
[Antibody detection in patients with invasive aspergillosis].,"The clinical significance of Aspergillus antibody assays for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) is unclear. In two studies, three different antibody assays were evaluated with patients suffering from proven IA: (i) a commercial haemagglutination test (HAT), (ii) a commercial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for IgG, IgM, and IgA, and (iii) an experimental mitogillin enzyme immunoassay for IgG, IgM, and IgA. In the first study, 99 serum samples from 26 patients with IA and 22 serum samples from 22 control patients were tested with all the three tests. Ten of the 26 patients (38%) reacted positively in at least one antibody assay. The highest sensitivity was generated by the detection of IgG using the EIA formats (22 and 21%, respectively), the HAT had a sensitivity of 8%. IgM type antibodies were detected in only two patients no IgA type antibodies were detected. The specificities of the IgG EIA and the HAT were 72 and 85%, respectively. Antibody detection was the single positive laboratory test in two patients with proven and probable IA. In the second study, antibody test results of 60 patients with proven IA were retrospectively evaluated. Fourteen patients (23%) tested positive in the EIA and/or in the HAT. Investigations of the antibody levels in individual immunocompromised patients over time revealed that IgG production started after a mean of 10.8 days after diagnosis of IA. To conclude, antibodies against Aspergillus were detected in 23% of patients with IA. The antibody production started in successfully treated immunosuppressed patients after a mean of 10.8 days after the onset of infection. In particular, the detection of IgG-antibodies with an EIA can be useful for the confirmation of the diagnosis of IA and for the monitoring of the treatment of IA.",2005,15667366,no
[Antigen detection in invasive aspergillosis and candidosis: the Austrian experience].,"In order to assess the performance of different methods for the detection of fungal antigens, data of five Austrian hospitals were evaluated. The enzyme immunoassay (EIA) Platelia Aspergillus Antigen (Bio-Rad, USA) was used for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis and compared with clinical data. It could be shown that it is more effective to investigate at least two sequential sera than only one sole serum. For several high-risk patients diagnosis could be improved or confirmed by investigating other body fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in addition to sera. For invasive Candida infections several diagnostic kits detecting antigens are commercially available. The performance of the EIA Platelia Candida Antigen (Bio-Rad, USA), the latexagglutination test Cand-Tec (Ramco, USA) and the detection of (1-3)-Beta-D-Glucan using the test kit Glucatell (CAPE COD, USA) were evaluated. The detection of (1-3)-Beta-D-Glucan by means of Glucatell showed the highest sensitivity as all sera of 15 patients with invasive candidosis showed positive results. The other tests showed positive and negative results independently of the occurrence of an invasive infection. However, the number of tested sera is too small to decide which test is the most appropriate for establishing an early and definite diagnosis. Prospective studies in combination with clinical data are still needed for definite evaluation.",2005,15667365,no

[Experience with the Platelia Candida ELISA for the diagnostics of invasive candidosis in neutropenic patients].,"Invasive Candida infections (IC) belong to the most important opportunistic fungal infections in immunocompromised patients. IC is difficult to diagnose, because clinical symptoms are nonspecific and cultural methods lack sensitivity or specificity. We evaluated the Platelia Candida enzyme immunoassay (Candida EIA) for the diagnosis of IC in patients with haematological malignancies. A total of 62 neutropenic patients with 469 serum samples were included in the study. Candida colonization was monitored by weekly cultures of mouth washings, urine, and stool samples. Yeasts were grown from samples of 42 patients (68%), mainly Candida albicans (50%), followed by Candida glabrata (23%) and Candida krusei (20%). According to the criteria of the EORTC/NIH, the patients were categorized: (1) 3 patients with proven IC (2) 6 patients with probable IC",2005,15667361,no
Functional display of family 11 endoxylanases on the surface of phage M13.,"Two family 11 endoxylanases (EC 3.2.1.8) were functionally displayed on the surface of bacteriophage M13. The genes encoding endo-1,4-xylanase I from Aspergillus niger (ExlA) and endo-1,4-xylanase A from Bacillus subtilis (XynA) were fused to the gene encoding the minor coat protein g3p in phagemid vector pHOS31. Phage rescue resulted in functional monovalent display of the enzymes as was demonstrated by three independent tests. Firstly, purified recombinant phage particles showed a clear hydrolytic activity in an activity assay based on insoluble, chromagenic arabinoxylan substrate. Secondly, specific binding of endoxylanase displaying phages to immobilized endoxylanase inhibitors was demonstrated by interaction ELISA. Finally, two rounds of selection and amplification in a biopanning procedure against immobilized endoxylanase inhibitor were performed. Phages displaying endoxylanases were strongly enriched from background phages displaying unrelated proteins. These results open perspectives to use phage display for analysing protein-protein interactions at the interface between endoxylanases and their inhibitors. In addition, this technology should enable engineering of endoxylanases into novel variants with altered binding properties towards endoxylanase inhibitors.",2005,15639087,no
Contribution of (1->3)-beta-D-glucan chromogenic assay to diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of invasive aspergillosis in neutropenic adult patients: a comparison with serial screening for circulating galactomannan.,"Two noninvasive diagnostic tests, (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan (BG) (Glucatell) and galactomannan (GM) (Platelia Aspergillus), were used retrospectively in a twice-weekly screening for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in 40 treatment episodes (one hospital visit per patient) in 40 neutropenic adult patients at high risk for IA. Five proven IA cases, three probable IA cases, and three possible IA cases were diagnosed. Diagnostic levels of both BG and GM were detected in 100% of patients with proven IA cases and in 66% of patients with probable IA cases. The kinetics of both markers in patients with IA were similar. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for GM and BG were identical, namely, 87.5, 89.6, 70, and 96.3%, respectively. False-positive reactions occurred at a rate of 10.3% in both tests, but the patients showing false-positive results were different in each test. Both tests anticipated the clinical diagnosis, computed tomography abnormalities, and the initiation of antifungal therapy in most patients, but BG tended to become positive earlier than GM. A combination of the two tests improved the specificity (to 100%) and positive predictive value (to 100%) of each individual test without affecting the sensitivity and negative predictive values. In conclusion, BG and GM detection are useful tests for the diagnosis of IA in high-risk hematological patients, but a combination of the two tests was very useful to identify false-positive reactions by each test.",2005,15634986,no
"Radiographic, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomographic, and rhinoscopic features of nasal aspergillosis in dogs.","To determine radiographic, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and rhinoscopic features of nasal aspergillosis in dogs.Prospective study.15 client-owned dogs.All dogs had clinical signs of chronic nasal disease the diagnosis of nasal aspergillosis was made on the basis of positive results for at least 2 diagnostic tests (serology, cytology, histology, or fungal culture) and detection of typical intrasinusal and intranasal fungal colonies and turbinate destruction via rhinoscopy. Radiography, MRI, and CT were performed under general anesthesia. Rhinoscopy was repeated to evaluate lesions and initiate treatment. Findings of radiography, MRI, CT, and rhinoscopy were compared.MRI and CT revealed lesions suggestive of nasal aspergillosis more frequently than did radiography. Computed tomography was the best technique for detection of cortical bone lesions the nature of abnormal soft tissue, however, could not be identified. Magnetic resonance imaging allowed evaluation of lesions of the frontal bone and was especially useful for differentiating between a thickened mucosa and secretions or fungal coloniesThe value of CT and MRI for diagnosis of nasal aspergillosis was similar and greater than that of radiography.

Human mycoses and current antifungal therapy.,"The Focus on Fungal Infections meeting has become a popular conference for specialists in medical mycology and antifungal chemotherapy. Highlights of the 8th meeting are reported, with a focus on infection and therapy. Although the incidence of mycoses has increased, the identification of these fungal etiologic agents remains difficult. Mucosal candidiasis caused by endogenous Candida albicans and Candida species remains the most common fungal manifestation in HIV-infected patients, while systemic infection by Aspergillus species also has increased in HIV patients. Two presenters at the meeting debated whether fungal infections in AIDS patients are becoming less common and less important. Various strategies for antifungal therapy in AIDS or HIV-positive patients were presented. Most fungal infections in solid organ transplant patients are due to Candida species or Aspergillus species however, dematiaceous (dark-pigmented) fungi are becoming more common fungal pathogens in these patients. Antifungal therapy remains difficult in this patient group. The meeting included an overview of the current status of diagnosing fungal infections through serodiagnostic techniques. If properly validated, serology can be useful in fungal diagnosis since antigens and antibodies are easier to detect than the invading organism. Premature infants are at high risk for developing invasive fungal infections. Antifungal drugs have not been tested in controlled clinical trials in these patients, thus therapy is accomplished using adult treatment regimens and anecdotal experience. As regards the new lipid-based formulations of amphotericin B, published clinical studies are only now appearing in the literature and these reports suggest that the new formulations have reduced toxicity and comparable efficacy compared to conventional amphotericin B under various clinical conditions. Correlation of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values with clinical response to therapy is beginning to emerge. Two fungal cell wall-active compounds have recently entered clinical trials: an echinocandin and the chitin-synthesis inhibitor nikkomycin Z. Pradimycin and analogues have been studied through experimental animal models with good success",2004,15616619,no
Heterogeneity of immune responses to various Aspergillus species in patients with allergic respiratory diseases.,"In the present study, allergenic significance of thirteen species of Aspergillus and their allergenic and antigenic relationship was studied. Of the 3025 ID tests performed with the 13 species of Aspergillus on 289 patients suffering with allergic respiratory diseases, 627 (20.7%) were positive (1+ to 4+), 386 (12.8%) being significantly positive (2+ to 4+) . Of the 64 patients eliciting a positive cutaneous response to at least one species, 42(65.6%) were positive to 5 or less number of species while others showed a broad spectrum of positive skin reactivity to different Aspergillus extracts. In RAST inhibition assays using pooled sera ofpatients sensitive to A. tamarii dose related inhibition was produced by homologous as well as 5 of the 12 heterologous species. Similarly, in A. terreus RAST inhibition was observed with homologous and A. tamarii extracts only. Our results suggested the presence of both species specific as well as shared allergenic components among different Aspergillus species. In TDIEP experiments using rabbit antisera to A. tamarii and A. terreus extracts multiple precipitin bands were observed with the homologous extracts. However, only 1-2 bands were produced by 6 heterologous Aspergillus species in each system. Collectively, these results gave evidence that there is heterogeneity of immune response in the patients with allergic respiratory diseases to different species of Aspergillus and also in rabbits immunized with Aspergillus extracts.",2004,15597671,no

Positive rates for isolation of Aspergillus spp. from the airways, and of galactomannan antigen and 1, 3-beta-D glucan in the serum were 44.3, 21.8, 26.5%, respectively. These findings did not show any differences according to underlying pulmonary disease. Twenty-nine patients died of the disease. Body mass indices, serum albumin levels and red blood cell counts were significantly lower in the patients who died. Extension of the lesion to the lower lobes or to 3 or more lobes was correlated significantly with poor survival.

Partial nuclear pore complex disassembly during closed mitosis in Aspergillus nidulans.,"Many organisms undergo closed mitosis and locate tubulin and mitotic kinases to nuclei only during mitosis. How this is regulated is unknown. Interestingly, the NIMA kinase of Aspergillus nidulans interacts with two nuclear pore complex (NPC) proteins and NIMA is required for mitotic localization of the Cdk1 kinase to nuclei. Therefore, we wished to define the mechanism by which the NPC is regulated during A. nidulans' closed mitosis.The structural makeup of the NPC is dramatically changed during A. nidulans' mitosis. At least five NPC proteins disperse throughout the cell during mitosis while at least three structural components remain at the NPC. These modifications correlate with marked changes in the function of the NPC. Notably, during mitosis, An-RanGAP is not excluded from nuclei, and five other nuclear or cytoplasmic proteins investigated fail to locate as they do during interphase. Mitotic modification of the NPC requires NIMA and Cdk1 kinase activation. NIMA appears to be particularly important. Most strikingly, ectopic induction of NIMA promotes mitotic-like changes in NPC structure and function during S phase. Furthermore, NIMA locates to the NPC during entry into mitosis, and a dominant-negative version of NIMA that causes G2 delay dwells at the NPC.We conclude that partial NPC disassembly under control of NIMA and Cdk1 in A. nidulans may represent a new mechanism for regulating closed mitoses. We hypothesize that proteins locate by their relative binding affinities within the cell during A. nidulans' closed mitosis, analogous to what occurs during open mitosis.",2004,15556859,no
Detection of aflatoxin-producing molds in Korean fermented foods and grains by multiplex PCR.,"An assay based on multiplex PCR was applied for the detection of potential aflatoxin-producing molds in Korean fermented foods and grains. Three genes, avfA, omtA, and ver-1, coding for key enzymes in aflatoxin biosynthesis, were used as aflatoxin-detecting target genes in multiplex PCR. DNA extracted from Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus parasiticus, Aspergillus oryzae, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus terreus, Penicillium expansum, and Fusarium verticillioides was used as PCR template to test specificity of the multiplex PCR assay. Positive results were achieved only with DNA that was extracted from the aflatoxigenic molds A. flavus and A. parasiticus in all three primer pairs. This result was supported by aflatoxin detection with direct competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DC-ELISA). The PCR assay required just a few hours, enabling rapid and simultaneous detection of many samples at a low cost. A total of 22 Meju samples, 24 Doenjang samples, and 10 barley samples commercially obtained in Korea were analyzed. The DC-ELISA assay for aflatoxin detection gave negative results for all samples, whereas the PCR-based method gave positive results for 1 of 22 Meju samples and 2 of 10 barley samples. After incubation of the positive samples with malt extract agar, DC-ELISA also gave positive results for aflatoxin detection. All Doenjang samples were negative by multiplex PCR and DC-ELISA assay, suggesting that aflatoxin contamination and the presence of aflatoxin-producing molds in Doenjang are probably low.",2004,15553652,no
[Guidelines for the management of deep mycosis in neutropenic patients].,"Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in neutropenic patients with leukemia and those undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Two major IFIs are systemic candidiasis (including candidemia, chronic disseminated candidiasis and pneumonia) and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Recently, the incidence of the latter has been increasing. Three levels of diagnosis are specified in the Japanese guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of IFIs. Proven fungal infections are diagnosed by histological/microbiological evidence of fungi at the site of infection or positive blood culture (fungemia). Clinically documented fungal infections are diagnosed by typical radiological findings such as halo sign on chest CT plus positive serological/molecular evidence of fungi such as Aspergillus galactomannan, beta-glucan or fungal DNA. Possible fungal infections are diagnosed by typical radiological findings or positive serological/molecular evidence of fungi. For patients with high risk such as those undergoing HSCT, antifungal prophylaxis using oral antifungal agents is recommended. For possible fungal infections, empiric therapy with fluconazole (FLCZ) or amphotericin B (AMPH) is recommended. For patients with proven fungal infections or clinically documented fungal infections, targeted therapy is warranted. In case of candidemia, the best choice is FLCZ (400 mg/day) or AMPH (0.5-0.7 mg/kg/day), and for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, a higher dose of AMPH (1.0-1.5 mg/kg/day) is indicated. Micafungin (MCFG), recently licensed in Japan, is an active agent for both Candida and Aspergillus. This drug seems useful for empiric and targeted therapy of IFIs.",2004,15550917,no
Utility of Aspergillus antigen detection in specimens other than serum specimens.,"The detection of circulating galactomannan in serum is an important tool for the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. A commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Platelia Aspergillus BioRad) was shown to be both highly sensitive and specific for detection of galactomannan in serum samples. Despite the fact that this assay is validated for serum samples, specimens of other body fluids are increasingly used for detection of galactomannan, including urine, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid. Review of the literature shows that galactomannan can be detected in each of these samples from patients with invasive aspergillosis with higher sensitivity than is the case with culture, as well as early in the course of infection. However, the evidence thus far is based on case reports--predominantly retrospective studies--that often include heterogeneous patient populations and limited numbers of cases of proven infection. Clearly, well-designed prospective studies with systematic sampling and use of consensus case definitions are needed to compare the performance of antigen detection in samples other than serum specimens with that in serum specimens.",2004,15546083,no
False-positive Aspergillus galactomannan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results in vivo during amoxicillin-clavulanic acid treatment.,"Positive Platelia Aspergillus test results were observed in consecutive serum samples from an immunocompromised host during amoxicillin-clavulanic acid treatment, and a correlation between plasmatic amoxicillin concentration and galactomannan optical density index was observed. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid vials tested positive for galactomannan but were negative for Aspergillus DNA.",2004,15528743,no
Contamination of aflatoxins in herbal medicinal products in Thailand.,"Twenty-eight herbal medicinal products from Thailand were investigated for aflatoxin (AF) contaminations by employing a specific HPLC assay for the determination of AFB1, B2, G1 and G2. The samples were extracted with 80% (v/v) methanol in water before further cleaned up with an immunoaffinity column and followed by the detection of AFs by using an electrochemically post-column derivatization with iodine and fluorescence detector. The extraction procedure was optimized in order to obtain the best recovery. The method was successfully carried out with all the herbal products diversified as to compositions and dosage forms. The results revealed that five (18%) of herbal samples were contaminated with detectable amount of the total AFs ranging from 1.7 to 14.3 ng/g. The association between particular herbal/plant and the AF contaminated could not be determined due to the low frequency of positive samples. The contaminated products were those in tablet (4) and capsule (1) dosage forms. It was possible that the original fungal infection of these products may have been derived from either the crude herbal or other ingredients making these preparations, such as starch. In conclusion, none of the AF contaminated level found was above the current legislative level permissible in Thailand (20 ng/g). A word of caution, however, exporting some high AF-contaminated herbal products to countries where more stringent permissable level of aflatoxins exist could result in trade Barriers.",2004,15518353,no
Anti-Aspergillus fumigatus efficacy of pentraxin 3 alone and in combination with antifungals.,"The collectin pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is an essential component of host resistance to pulmonary aspergillosis. Here we examined the protective effects of administration of PTX3 alone or together with deoxycholate amphotericin B (Fungizone) or liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) against invasive aspergillosis in a murine model of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. PTX3, alone or in combination with the polyenes, was given intranasally or parenterally either before, in concomitance with, or after the intranasal infection with Aspergillus fumigatus conidia. Mice were monitored for resistance to infection and parameters of innate and adaptive T-helper immunity. The results showed the following: (i) complete resistance to infection and reinfection was observed in mice treated with PTX3 alone (ii) the protective effect of PTX3 was similar or superior to that observed with liposomal amphotericin B or deoxycholate amphotericin B, respectively",2004,15504871,no
Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin mediates binding and internalization of Aspergillus fumigatus conidia by dendritic cells and macrophages.,"Aspergillus fumigatus is responsible for a large percentage of nosocomial opportunistic fungal infections in immunocompromised hosts, especially during cytotoxic chemotherapy and after bone marrow transplantation, and is currently a major direct cause of death in leukemia patients. Dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) is a type II C-type lectin that functions as an adhesion receptor and is used by viral and bacterial pathogens to gain access to human DC. We report that DC-SIGN specifically interacts with clinical isolates of A. fumigatus. DC-SIGN-dependent binding of A. fumigatus conidia can be demonstrated with stable transfectants and monocyte-derived DC and is inhibited by anti-DC-SIGN Abs. Binding and internalization of A. fumigatus conidia correlates with DC-SIGN cell surface expression levels and is abolished in the presence of A. fumigatus-derived cell wall galactomannans. The clinical relevance of this interaction is emphasized by the presence of DC-SIGN in lung DC and alveolar macrophages, and further illustrated by the DC-SIGN-dependent attachment of A. fumigatus conidia to the cell membrane of IL-4-treated monocyte-derived macrophages. Our results suggest the involvement of DC-SIGN in the initial stages of pulmonary infection as well as in fungal spreading during invasive aspergillosis.",2004,15494514,no
[Invasive aspergillosis in Castilla y Leon and Cantabria: years 1998 and 1999].,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a life-threatening mycosis showing a fast clinical course, affecting immunosupressed people particularly patients suffering leukemia or following organ transplantation programs. The aim of this work is to show epidemiologycal concerns about IA in Castilla y Leon and Cantabria: the disease's incidence, the main clinical presentations, the underlaying diseases and diagnostic rules in the laboratory.50 cases of IA were obtained from the countries of Castilla y Leon and Cantabria in a two-years (1998-1999) retrospective study. Epidemiology, clinical and diagnostic features including the 14 main institutions were registered and accounted in a single data base.The majority of IA cases were recorded in major institutions possessing haematology units or organ transplantation programs. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was the main feature (39/50 cases) showing serious underlying diseases (25/50 cases) or following organ transplantation programs (15/50 cases). Certain diagnosis was obtained for only ten cases of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and eleven cases of extrapulmonary stages of IA. In a high number of cases (44/50 cases) conventional microbiological procedures (42/50 showing positive cultures) were developed. Serology investigations were undertaken in eight cases. Serological issues relying on anti-Aspergillus antibodies showed no diagnostic value. Aspergillus fumigatus was the most common species involved in IA (33/44 cases).A low incidence of the disease in this country was reported: with 50 cases in 14 hospital institutions during a two-year period. We observed most cases in large hospital centres performing transplant operations. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was the main clinical setting in immunosupressed patients. Microbiology diagnostic issues relied on conventional methods in particularly on culture.",2004,15487910,no
Antigen assay with the potential to aid in diagnosis of blastomycosis.,"We report results of an immunoassay for Blastomyces dermatitidis antigenuria. Sensitivity was 92.9%, and specificity was 79.3%. Cross-reactions occurred in 96.3% of patients with histoplasmosis, 100% of patients with paracoccidioidomycosis, 70% of patients with penicilliosis marneffei, 2.9% of patients with cryptococcosis, and 1.1% of patients with aspergillosis. Reproducibility was 96.3%. These findings support a potential role for antigen testing in blastomycosis.",2004,15472368,no
"Detection of galactomannan antigenemia in patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam and correlations between in vitro, in vivo, and clinical properties of the drug-antigen interaction.","Recent case reports describe patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam who were found to have circulating galactomannan detected by the double sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system, leading to the false presumption of invasive aspergillosis. Since this property of piperacillin-tazobactam and galactomannan ELISA is not well understood, we investigated the in vitro, in vivo, and clinical properties of this interaction. Among the 12 reconstituted antibiotics representing four classes of antibacterial compounds that are commonly used in immunocompromised patients, piperacillin-tazobactam expressed a distinctively high level of galactomannan antigen in vitro (P = 0.001). After intravenous infusion of piperacillin-tazobactam into rabbits, the serum galactomannan index (GMI) in vivo changed significantly (P = 0.0007) from a preinfusion mean baseline value of 0.27 to a mean GMI of 0.83 by 30 min to slowly decline to a mean GMI of 0.44 24 h later. Repeated administration of piperacillin-tazobactam over 7 days resulted in accumulation of circulating galactomannan to a mean peak GMI of 1.31 and a nadir of 0.53. Further studies revealed that the antigen reached a steady state by the third day of administration of piperacillin-tazobactam. Twenty-six hospitalized patients with no evidence of invasive aspergillosis who were receiving antibiotics and ten healthy blood bank donors were studied for expression of circulating galactomannan. Patients (n = 13) receiving piperacillin-tazobactam had significantly greater mean serum GMI values (0.74 +/- 0.14) compared to patients (n = 13) receiving other antibiotics (0.14 +/- 0.08) and compared to healthy blood bank donors (0.14 +/- 0.06) (P < 0.001). Five (38.5%) of thirteen patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam had serum GMI values > 0.5 compared to none of thirteen subjects receiving other antibiotics (P = 0.039) and to none of ten healthy blood bank donors (P = 0.046). These data demonstrate that among antibiotics that are commonly used in immunocompromised patients, only piperacillin-tazobactam contains significant amounts of galactomannan antigen in vitro, that in animals receiving piperacillin-tazobactam circulating galactomannan antigen accumulates in vivo to significantly increased and sustained levels, and that some but not all patients receiving this antibiotic will demonstrate circulating galactomannan above the threshold considered positive for invasive aspergillosis by the recently licensed double sandwich ELISA.",2004,15472335,no
Seroincidence of Coccidioidomycosis during military desert training exercises.,"Coccidioidomycosis is a common fungal infection acquired in the southwestern United States. This is the first study in over 2 decades to determine the seroincidence of Coccidioides immitis infections among U.S. military members performing training exercises in an area of endemicity. Only 8% of participants were aware of coccidioidomycosis, despite the majority having visited or lived previously in an area of endemicity. One (0.6%) of the 178 participants developed ""definite"" serologic evidence of infection over a 5-week training period four (2.3%) additional patients developed ""possible"" coccidioidomycosis infections. None had complicated disease. The calculated annual incidence ranged from 6 to 32%. This study suggests that the risk of serious coccidioidomycosis is low among military personnel during desert training exercises",2004,15472308,no
The Aspergillus fumigatus cell wall is organized in domains that are remodelled during polarity establishment.,"Aspergillus fumigatus is a life-threatening and increasingly frequent pathogen of the immunocompromised. Like other filamentous fungi A. fumigatus grows in a highly polar manner, adding new cell wall to the apical region of hyphae. mAbs were raised against isolated A. fumigatus cell walls. Fifteen antibodies bound reproducibly to isolated cell walls in ELISAs and to the walls of intact cells in immunofluorescence experiments. Surprisingly, individual mAbs showed distinct patterns of localization. Six antibodies labelled exclusively conidial or basal regions, seven labelled apical regions and a single antibody labelled both basal and apical regions of hyphae. Ten antibodies did not label the walls adjacent to septa. In double labelling experiments with representative mAbs there was little or no overlap between epitopes recognized. These labelling patterns suggest that the wall is made up of basal and apical domains that differ in composition or organization and that the wall region flanking septa differs from other regions of the lateral wall. In time-course experiments of early A. fumigatus growth, mAb16C4 failed to label isotropically expanding cells and labelled emerging germ tubes and branches. The same mAb failed to label the Aspergillus nidulans swoC mutant, which is defective in polarity establishment. However, mAb16C4 did label the A. nidulans swoA mutant, which completes polarity establishment, but is defective in polarity maintenance. Thus, mAb16C4 appears to recognize a cell wall change that occurs during polarity establishment. In immunogold labelling and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments, conidia, basal regions and apical regions of thin-sectioned cells labelled with mAb16C4. That only apical regions labelled in intact cells (immunofluorescence) while conidial, basal and apical regions labelled in thin-sectioned cells (TEM) suggests that the 16C4 epitope is present along the whole hypha, but is masked everywhere except the tip until polarity establishment. That is to say, some remodelling of the wall during polarity establishment exposes the 16C4 epitope. The 16C4 epitope was partially purified from A. fumigatus total protein by passage through hydrophobic interaction and anion-exchange columns. The resulting single ELISA-positive fraction showed relatively few bands by SDS-PAGE and silver staining and a strong band by Western blotting with the16C4 mAb. Sequencing of the fraction yielded a predicted peptide with a 6-amino acid exact match to a region of the Cat1 protein previously identified as an immunodominant A. fumigatus catalase that localizes to the cell wall and is secreted to the medium. Experiments are under way to determine if mAb16C4 recognizes Cat1 or another protein that co-purifies with Cat1.",2004,15470106,no
Substitution of Pichia pastoris-derived recombinant proteins with mannose containing O- and N-linked glycans decreases specificity of diagnostic tests.,"Recombinant proteins from Pichia pastoris need to be fully evaluated before used as diagnostic tools.The objective of this study was to investigate whether glycosylation by P. pastoris interferes with the specificity of diagnostic tests.An autoantigen involved in Wegener's disease (protease 3) and 2 major inhalant allergens from grass pollen (Dac g 5) and house dust mite (Der p 1) were produced as recombinant molecules in P. pastoris. O-linked glycans on Dac g 5 were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The immune reactivity of the recombinant proteins was compared to that of their natural counterparts by ELISA and a radio-allergosorbent test (RAST) as well as by ELISA and RAST inhibition.In contrast to the non-glycosylated natural allergen, recombinant Dac g 5 was shown to carry at least 2 small mannose-containing O-glycans. We showed that both these O-glycans and the N-linked glycans on recombinant protease 3 and recombinant Der p 1 were recognized in ELISA by IgG antibodies in sera of healthy individuals. These IgG responses were closely correlated. The natural autoantigen and allergens were not recognized by IgG antibodies from healthy subjects. The carbohydrate nature of the epitopes recognized by IgG on the recombinant proteins was confirmed by inhibition studies with mannose and yeast mannan. IgE recognition of yeast glycans was observed in 2 out of 9 positive sera from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.Production of recombinant molecules in yeast (or moulds) can introduce IgG-binding glycans that negatively affect the specificity of diagnostic tests.",2004,15467371,no
[Value of Aspergillus galactomannan antigen detection in the diagnosis and follow-up of invasive aspergillosis in hematological patients].,"Serum galactomannan detection is considered to be a useful test for early diagnosis and follow-up of invasive aspergillosis. From February to September 2002, adult patients hospitalized in our Hematology Unit for receiving intensive chemotherapy and/or hematopoietic stem cell transplant were prospectively studied. We analyzed a total of 760 samples obtained from 100 patients. Eleven patients (11%) having a positive result (OD index >1.5 ng/ml) in two consecutive Platelia Aspergillus tests were considered galactomannan-positive cases. On the other hand, 12 patients (12%) were diagnosed of proven or probable invasive aspergillosis. Sensitivity (66.6%), specificity (95.5%), positive predictive value (72.7%) and negative predictive value (96.7%) were comparable to those of larger series. Galactomannan positivity allowed also to anticipate invasive aspergillosis diagnosis (from two to 17 days before radiographic findings and from two to 15 days before mycological culture). Moreover, kinetics of antigenemia could be useful for assessing therapeutic response. Once accepted galactomannan test as a diagnostic criterium for invasive aspergillosis knowing potential causes of false positive results is of paramount importance.",2004,15456368,no
[Aspergillus galactomannan detection in allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation].,Invasive aspergillosis has become the leading cause of death after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

[Usefulness of galactomannan detection in the diagnosis and follow-up of hematological patients with invasive aspergillosis].,"The usefulness of galactomannan detection using the Platelia Aspergillus test for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis was studied in 849 sera from 54 hematological patients with prolonged neutropenia, which were classified according to the risk for invasive aspergillosis. Three patients developed a proven invasive aspergillosis, one a probable invasive aspergillosis and 17 patients a possible invasive aspergillosis. Thirty-three patients showed no evidence of invasive aspergillosis. All patients with proven invasive aspergillosis had a high risk for invasive aspergillosis, while the one having probable invasive aspergillosis had intermediate risk. Detection of galactomannan in this study showed a sensitivity of 66.7% for patients with proven invasive aspergillosis and 50% for patients with proven and probable invasive aspergillosis. The specificity was 98% or higher in all groups studied. The predictive positive and negative values for patients with proven invasive aspergillosis were 66.7% and 98%, respectively. A rise in the concentration of galactomannan was observed in patients who failed to respond to the antifungal treatment. Galactomannan antigenemia preceded post-mortem histological diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in two patients by 17 and 81 days, respectively. In conclusion, detection of galactomannan by the Platelia Aspergillus test allows for a specific and relatively sensitive diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in hematological patients with a high and intermediate risk for invasive aspergillosis.",2004,15456366,yes
[Early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in neutropenic patients with bi-weekly serial screening of circulating galactomannan by Platelia Aspergillus].,"The diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in neutropenic individuals is difficult and lengthy since non-invasive diagnostic tests lack sensitivity and specificity. The diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in 154 prolonged neutropenic patients was prospectively bi-weekly validated by screening circulating galactomannan. The global sensitivity was 73% and specificity was 96%. The positive and negative predictive values were 73% and 98% respectively. False positive reactions occurred at a rate of 2%. Antigenemia was detected before clinical suspicion of invasive aspergillosis (median, 6 days before) in 30% of patients and anticipated the onset of radiologic signs 9 days in 60% of patients.the prospective screening of galactomannan is a sensitive and non-invasive tool for early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in high-risk adult hematology patients.",2004,15456365,no
[Laboratory diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis].,"Invasive aspergillosis is major cause of morbility and mortality in immunosuppressed patients, in part due to the inability to identify infected patients at an early stage of the disease.

Modulation of airway inflammation by immunostimulatory CpG oligodeoxynucleotides in a murine model of allergic aspergillosis.,"Allergic aspergillosis is a Th2 T-lymphocyte-mediated pulmonary complication in patients with atopic asthma and cystic fibrosis. Therefore, any therapeutic strategy that selectively inhibits Th2 T-cell activation may be useful in downregulating allergic lung inflammation in asthma. In the present study, we developed a CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN)-based immune intervention of allergic inflammation in a mouse model of allergic aspergillosis. Four different groups of mice were used in a short-term immunization protocol. Three experimental groups of animals (groups 1 to 3) were sensitized with Aspergillus fumigatus antigens. Animals in group 1 were immunized with A. fumigatus antigen alone, while those in group 2 were treated with CpG-ODN 1 day before the first antigen immunization, and the animals in group 3 received the first CpG-ODN administration between the antigen treatments. The animals in group 4 served as controls and were given phosphate-buffered saline. Allergen-specific serum immunoglobulins and total immunoglobulin E in different groups of animals were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while airway remodeling and cytokine production were studied by immunohistochemistry. The results demonstrated that CpG-ODN administration either before (group 2) or between (group 3) antigen treatments resulted in reduced total immunoglobulin E levels and peripheral blood eosinophil numbers compared to A. fumigatus allergen-sensitized group 1 animals. Similarly, treatment with CpG-ODN also downregulated inflammatory cell infiltration, goblet cell hyperplasia, and basement membrane thickening compared to A. fumigatus-sensitized mice. The distinct reduction in peripheral blood eosinophilia and airway remodeling in CpG-ODN-treated mice emphasized its usefulness as an immunomodulating agent for allergic fungal diseases.",2004,15385513,no
"Modulation of the human interleukin-12p40 response by a triazole antifungal derivative, itraconazole.","Some types of antimicrobial agents such as fosfomycin, clarithromycin, and erythromycin have been known to affect the host's immunological response. We investigated whether itraconazole (ITCZ) can modulate the serum cytokine levels (tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-12p40) in both patients and healthy subjects. Serum samples were collected and TNF-alpha, IL-10 and IL-12p40 were measured using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We showed increased levels of IL-12p40 in patients treated with ITCZ. In healthy subjects, moreover, ITCZ treatment significantly increased the production of IL-12p40, but not TNF-alpha or IL-10. These findings suggest that the effectiveness of ITCZ in the treatment of fungal infection may be due not only to its direct antifungal effect, but also to induction of an immunomodulative effect on the host defense systems by regulation of cytokine production.",2004,15370674,no
The solubilization and biological activities of Aspergillus beta-(1 --> 3)-D-glucan.,"We have recently demonstrated that the cell wall beta-glucan of Candida albicans could be solubilized by sodium hypochlorite, followed by dimethylsulfoxide-extraction (NaClO-DMSO method). In this study, applying this method to Aspergillus spp., we prepared mycelial cell wall beta-glucan and examined its physical properties and immunotoxicological activity. The acetone-dried mycelia of Aspergillus spp. were oxidized by the NaClO-DMSO method. An analysis of (13)C NMR spectra revealed the preparations to be composed of alpha-(1 --> 3) and beta-(1 --> 3)-D-glucan. Also, the proportion of alpha-(1 --> 3) and beta-(1 --> 3)-D-glucan varied. Furthermore, a solubilized Aspergillus beta-glucan (ASBG) was prepared from OX-Asp by urea-autoclave treatment. ASBG showed limulus activity similar to Candida solubilized beta-glucan (CSBG), and there was little difference in the activity of ASBG between various Aspergillus spp. ASBG affected the production of IL-8 by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). ASBG should be useful for analyzing the clinical role of beta-glucan.",2004,15364099,no
"[The performance of (1, 3)-beta-D-glucan and Aspergillus galactomannan measurement for early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in patients with hematological diseases].","We analyzed the performance of (1, 3)-Beta-D-glucan (measurement by the alkaline-kinetic chromogenic Limulus method (FUNGITEC G test-MK, Fungitec) and the kinetic turbidimetric Limulus method [Beta-Glucan test WAKO, Wako]) and we carried out Aspergillus galactomannan antigen detection (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA test) for the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in patients with hematological diseases at the time of febrile episodes of unknown origin that did not respond to antibacterial therapy for more than 3 days. During a one-year period (April 2002 to March 2003), a total of 69 febrile episodes in 58 patients were studied 8 cases of invasive aspergillosis were diagnosed according to the definition of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycosis Study Group, and 61 cases were found to be non-mycotic diseases. Based on the analysis of 69 results with confirmed disease status, the overall performance of the Fungitec, the Wako, and the ELISA test were as follows: sensitivity was 0.88, 0.63, and 0.50, respectively, whereas the specificity was 0.85, 0.98, and 1.0, respectively.

Prospective clinical evaluation of lower cut-offs for galactomannan detection in adult neutropenic cancer patients and haematological stem cell transplant recipients.,"The recent advent of an improved commercial serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of circulating galactomannan (GM), a major constituent of Aspergillus cell walls, has contributed to the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in many haematology and transplant centres. However, the optimal threshold for positivity remains a matter of debate. We prospectively evaluated the impact of lowering the cut-off in 124 neutropenic episodes with a high pretest probability for IA. Two new cut-off points, lower than previously accepted, are proposed: (a) a 'static' cut-off at 0.8 and (b) a 'dynamic' cut-off at 0.5. A single assay with an optical density (OD) index > or = 0.8 warrants the initiation of anti-Aspergillus therapy. A further lowering of the 'static' threshold seems not clinically feasible given the drop in positive predictive value (PPV). However, the demonstration of at least two sequential sera with an OD > or = 0.5 ('dynamic' threshold) increased the specificity and the PPV to 98.6% and the efficiency to 98%. Applying both cut-offs to a subgroup of 21 'possible' fungal infections further identified and upgraded six cases of IA. However, the clinical benefit of lower cut-offs (particularly for earlier diagnosis) depends upon the kinetics of antigenaemia and the intensity of serum sampling.",2004,15352990,no
[Anti-aspergillus Th immunity induced by dendritic cells and the effect of hydrocortisone on it].,"To investigate the role of dendritic cells (DCs) in host defense against aspergillus, and how corticosteroids hydrocortisone (HC) affects host anti-aspergillus immunity at the DCs level.Mouse bone marrow-derived DCs were generated ex vivo and the uptake of inactivated Aspergillus fumigatus conidia (iAfc) by DCs was assayed using McFarland standard. Cytokine production by DCs or by splenic T cells were measured using ELISA method.DCs were capable of ingesting iAfc efficiently. HC significantly inhibited the capacity of DCs to phagocytose iAfc. After stimulated with iAfc in vitro, DCs secreted IL-12 and IFN-gamma, but did not secret IL-10. 10(-5) mol/L HC down-regulated IL-12 and IFN-gamma production by DCs, but it didn't affect IL-10 production. After the mice were inoculated with iAfc-pulsed DCs, their splenic T cells secreted IFN-gamma upon the re-stimulation with iAfc in vitro. In contrast, after the mice were inoculated with iAfc-HC-pulsed DCs, the splenic T cells showed significantly decreased IFN-gamma secretion upon the same stimulation, but the secretion of IL-10 was increased.DCs might act as effector cells in host defense against aspergillus, and initiate anti-aspergillus Th1 type immunity. HC inhibited the above functions of DCs and skew the immunity response towards Th2 type. iAfc-pulsed DCs might be useful for promoting the anti-aspergillus immunity of immunocompromised host.",2004,15312557,no
Paranasal sinus aspergillosis: its categorization to develop a treatment protocol.,"A prospective study was conducted in 25 consecutive patients of paranasal sinus aspergillosis to categorize and treat them based on a fixed treatment protocol. The three types of aspergillosis categorized as per definitive criteria were chronic invasive (six), non-invasive (fungus ball) (seven) and non-invasive destructive (12). Adjuvant chemotherapy was employed in non-invasive destructive and chronic invasive disease. Ketoconazole was used in the first variety and itroconazole in the latter. Only two patients had recurrence after a mean follow-up of 11 months (range: 6-20 months). They belonged to the non-invasive destructive category and the recurrence had progressed to invasive variety. It is suggested that non-invasive destructive disease should be followed up regularly with endoscopic examination, CT and fungal serology to detect recurrence. Categorization of the paranasal sinus aspergillosis helps to institute proper treatment. Adjuvant chemotherapy in the form of ketoconazole along with surgery is effective in non-invasive destructive disease to prevent recurrence and progression to invasive disease. Chronic invasive disease with its propensity to involve orbit and intracranial cavity should be managed at the earliest with surgery and itraconazole.",2004,15310329,no
Rapid differentiation of Aspergillus species from other medically important opportunistic molds and yeasts by PCR-enzyme immunoassay.,"We developed a PCR-based assay to differentiate medically important species of Aspergillus from one another and from other opportunistic molds and yeasts by employing universal, fungus-specific primers and DNA probes in an enzyme immunoassay format (PCR-EIA). Oligonucleotide probes, directed to the internal transcribed spacer 2 region of ribosomal DNA from Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus terreus, Aspergillus ustus, and Aspergillus versicolor, differentiated 41 isolates (3 to 9 each of the respective species P < 0.001) in a PCR-EIA detection matrix and gave no false-positive reactions with 33 species of Acremonium, Exophiala, Candida, Fusarium, Mucor, Paecilomyces, Penicillium, Rhizopus, Scedosporium, Sporothrix, or other aspergilli tested. A single DNA probe to detect all seven of the most medically important Aspergillus species (A. flavus, A. fumigatus, A. nidulans, A. niger, A. terreus, A. ustus, and A. versicolor) was also designed. Identification of Aspergillus species was accomplished within a single day by the PCR-EIA, and as little as 0.5 pg of fungal DNA could be detected by this system. In addition, fungal DNA extracted from tissues of experimentally infected rabbits was successfully amplified and identified using the PCR-EIA system. This method is simple, rapid, and sensitive for the identification of medically important Aspergillus species and for their differentiation from other opportunistic fungi.",2004,15297489,no
Geotrichum capitatum fungemia with skin lesions similar to varicella in a patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia.,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) can cause increased morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised persons. Varicella lesions (macules, papules and vesicles) often appear first on the scalp, face or trunk. We report the case of a leukemic patient who developed multiple maculopapular rashes with central vesicles after chemotherapy. The skin lesions were first noted on the scalp, face and then trunk and extremities. These manifestations were similar to those caused by VZV. Both blood culture and skin vesicle fluid culture yielded Geotrichum capitatum, which is a thermotolerant, yeast-like fungus that forms on culture cream-colored wrinkled colonies. Serology study and throat swab culture for VZV were negative. This case raises the possibility that fungal infection can manifest chickenpox-like skin lesions in immunocompromised patients.",2004,15264705,no
"CNS aspergillosis with mycotic aneurysm, cerebral granuloma and infarction.","We are reporting a case of an immunocompromised patient with invasive aspergillosis (IA) who developed aspergillotic granulomas and a mycotic aneurysm of the superior cerebellar artery. The route of infection of the central nervous system (CNS) was hematogenous spread from a pulmonary focus. IA was detected with the Galactomannan (GM) technique. However, despite treatment with amphotericin B, progressive involvement of the vessel wall occurred causing fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage and massive brainstem and cerebellar infarction. This case provides pathologic-imaging correlation of one of the most devastating types of fungal involvement affecting the CNS with a fungal aneurysm. Finally the literature regarding the pathogenetic, and diagnostic investigations and the management of CNS aspergillosis is reviewed.",2004,15254808,no
Mannose-binding lectin gene polymorphism is a modulating factor in repeated respiratory infections.,"To clarify how mannose-binding lectin (MBL) participates in the pulmonary defense system.Multicenter retrospective study.Sixty-two patients with unexplained recurrent respiratory infections, 50 patients with nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, 23 patients with aspergillosis, and 49 patients with diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB). For controls, 52 blood samples were provided by the Blood Donation Center of the Japanese Red Cross Society. For BAL fluid (BALF) evaluation, there were five patients with acute phase pneumonia and five healthy volunteers.We demonstrated that MBL protein could be directly measured in the BALF from the lungs of patients with pneumonia by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the prevalence of the codon 54 mutation of the MBL gene in 62 patients having repeated respiratory infections was significantly higher compared with healthy control subjects (54.8% vs 32.7%). The prevalence of the MBL mutant genotype among patients with DPB was higher (51.1%) than in the rest of the patients. In contrast, the prevalence of the MBL mutant genotype among patients with nontuberculous mycobacteria or Aspergillus chronic infection was not significantly different from that in control subjects (44.0% and 34.8%).Our results suggest that MBL may play an important role in modulating the inflammatory response against repeated microbial infections.",2004,15249448,no
[Current development in the diagnostics and therapy of systemic fungal infections in cancer patients].,"Invasive fungal infections are associated with a high morbidity and mortality. They are of growing concern and a severe infectious complication in cancer patients treated with intensive chemotherapy.

Recent developments in the epidemiology, diagnostics and treatment of fungal infections are reviewed and discussed in the context of the current state of art for the management of invasive fungal infections in cancer patients.",2004,15244045,no
Detection of galactomannan antigenemia by enzyme immunoassay for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis: variables that affect performance.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a frequent complication of blood or marrow transplantation. Previous studies have reported that the Aspergillus galactomannan enzyme immunoassay (GM EIA) may be a useful diagnostic tool for IA, but its sensitivity is variable. We examined the performance of the GM EIA in 986 serum samples from 67 patients. Results demonstrated that decreasing the index cutoff for positivity to 0.5 increased its sensitivity, with minimal loss of specificity. The low cutoff increased the duration of test positivity before diagnosis by clinical means. Sensitivity was highest in patients who did not receive preventative mold-active antifungals (87.5%). A rabbit model demonstrated that the level of circulating antigen correlated with the tissue fungus burden. A quantifiable response to antifungal therapy in clinical samples and the rabbit model supports the development of this assay for early diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring. The 0.5 cutoff may allow for better performance as an early diagnostic test.",2004,15243943,yes
Immunologic reactivity to work-related airborne allergens in people occupationally exposed to dust from herbs.,"A group of 150 people occupationally exposed to dust from herbs were examined. The examined group consisted of 47 thyme farmers, 32 chamomile farmers, 31 sage farmers and 40 workers of herbs processing industry. As a reference group, 50 urban dwellers, not exposed to any kind of organic dust, were examined. Skin prick tests and precipitin tests were conducted with, respectively, 4 and 11 microbial antigens associated with organic dust. Both skin and precipitin tests were also conducted with herbal extracts of chamomile and sage. Precipitin tests were carried out with sera not concentrated and sera 3-fold concentrated. Tests for inhibition of leukocyte migration (MIF) were also conducted with 4 microbial antigens. People occupationally exposed to dust from herbs showed a higher frequency of positive skin reactions to microbial antigens compared to the reference group. The results of precipitin test also revealed greater reactivity to the environmental microbial antigens in the examined group, compared to the reference group. The highest frequency of positive results was noted with the antigen of Pantoea agglomerans (30.6 % with sera not concentrated and 48.3 % with sera 3-fold concentrated) - the difference compared to the reference group (12.0 %) was highly significant (p < 0.01). The frequencies of positive results of MIF test in the examined group were high with all antigens tested: Arthrobacter globiformis (12.6 %), Pantoea agglomerans (11.1 %), Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula (17.0 %), Aspergillus fumigatus (13.3 %), and, compared to the reference group with no positive result for any antigen, all the differences were significant (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the frequency of positive allergological reactions to airborne microorganisms was high in people occupationally exposed to dust from herbs and suggests a potential role of microbial allergens in the pathogenesis of work-related health disorders among herb workers. The risk of sensitization seems to be greatest among thyme farmers, who showed the highest positive response. The results confirmed the particular allergenic importance of Gram-negative bacterium Pantoea agglomerans.",2004,15236509,no
Successful micafungin (FK463) treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a phase II study.,"We treated a 52-year-old woman with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who developed invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) as a result of neutropenia following remission-induction chemotherapy. Although serological test results, such as those for platelia and pastrex, were all negative and the serum level of beta-D-glucan was low, Aspergillus DNA was detected in blood by the polymerase chain reaction method. A clinically documented diagnosis of IPA was made on the basis of chest x-rays, computed tomography scan findings, and the detection of Aspergillus DNA. Micafungin (FK463), a candin class antifungal agent, was administered at a dose of 75 to 150 mg/day, because other antifungal agents were not effective. The increase in serum concentration of micafungin was dose-dependent and was accompanied by improvement of symptoms and objective findings. Micafungin was effective for the treatment of IPA in this patient with ALL.",2004,15218972,no
Exposure to Aspergillus fumigatus spores induces chemokine expression in mouse macrophages.,"Inhalation of fungal spores may cause inflammation and respiratory diseases, such as bronchitis, allergic alveolitis, and asthma. Alveolar macrophages provide the first line of defense in the respiratory tract. To examine the cellular mechanisms involved in Aspergillus fumigatus-induced airway inflammation, mouse macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) cells were exposed for 2 h or 6 h to graded doses of A. fumigatus spores that were either alive or heat-killed. Furthermore, the ability of the cells to phagocytize the spores was visualized by electron microscopy. Expression of selected cytokines and chemokines was assessed by a real time quantitative PCR method and by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) after exposure. A significant increase in mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, and MCP-1 was observed with a maximal induction at 6h after exposure to the highest (1 x 10(7)) concentration of live spores. Similar response was not detected with heat-killed spores in the expression of chemokines and cytokines, even though there were no differences between the phagocytosis of live and heat-killed spores. These results suggest that exposure to live spores of A. fumigatus can modulate the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in mouse macrophages and thus influence the development of inflammatory processes in the airways.",2004,15212821,no
[Aortobronchial fistula induced by pulmonary mucormycosis in acute myeloid leukemia].,"A 51-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (M1) in January 2002. During the course of induction therapy, she developed a fever and chest radiography revealed bilateral infiltrates. She was treated with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and fluconazole, but her condition continued to worsen. She then began receiving amphotericin B, although there was no evidence of a fungal infection from the sputum culture and serologic testing. The patient soon became afebrile and improved clinically. On the 87th hospital day, however, she had a bout of abrupt massive hemoptysis and died of exsanguination. The diagnosis of aortobronchial fistula due to pulmonary mucormycosis was obtained at autopsy. Because of the angioinvasive tendency of mucormycosis, fatal hemoptysis in some patients with pulmonary mucormycosis has been reported, but most cases involve hemoptysis resulting from mucor invasion of the pulmonary artery. To our knowledge, this case represents the fourth description of pulmonary mucormycosis with fatal bleeding from the aorta.",2004,15199748,no
"Prospective comparison of the diagnostic potential of real-time PCR, double-sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for galactomannan, and a (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan test in weekly screening for invasive aspergillosis in patients with hematological disorders.","The establishment of an optimal noninvasive method for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis (IA) is needed to improve the management of this life-threatening infection in patients with hematological disorders, and a number of noninvasive tests for IA that target different fungal components, including galactomannan, (1-->3)-beta-d-glucan (BDG), and Aspergillus DNA, have been developed. In this study, we prospectively evaluated the diagnostic potential of three noninvasive tests for IA that were used in a weekly screening strategy: the double-sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for galactomannan (Platelia Aspergillus), a real-time PCR assay for Aspergillus DNA (GeniQ-Asper), and an assay for BDG (beta-glucan Wako). We analyzed 149 consecutive treatment episodes in 96 patients with hematological disorders who were at high risk for IA and diagnosed 9 proven IA cases, 2 probable IA cases, and 13 possible invasive fugal infections. In a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the area under the ROC curve was greatest for ELISA, using two consecutive positive results (0.97 P = 0.036 for ELISA versus PCR, P = 0.055 for ELISA versus BDG). Based on the ROC curve, the cutoff for the ELISA could be reduced to an optical density index (O.D.I.) of 0.6. With the use of this cutoff for ELISA and cutoffs for PCR and BDG that give a comparable level of specificity, the sensitivity/specificity/positive predictive value/negative predictive value of the ELISA and the PCR and BDG tests were 1.00/0.93/0.55/1.00, 0.55/0.93/0.40/0.96, and 0.55/0.93/0.40/0.96, respectively. In conclusion, among these weekly screening tests for IA, the double-sandwich ELISA test was the most sensitive at predicting the diagnosis of IA in high-risk patients with hematological disorders, using a reduced cutoff of 0.6 O.D.I.",2004,15184460,yes
PINA is essential for growth and positively influences NIMA function in Aspergillus nidulans.,"The phospho-Ser/Thr-directed prolyl-isomerase Pin1 was originally identified in vertebrate systems as a negative regulator of NIMA, a Ser/Thr protein kinase that regulates the G(2)/M transition in Aspergillus nidulans. Here we explore the physiological roles of the Pin1 orthologue, PINA, in A. nidulans and evaluate the relevance of the interaction of PINA with NIMA in this fungus. We find pinA to be an essential gene in A. nidulans. In addition, when PINA levels are reduced 50-fold the cells grow at a reduced rate. Upon germination under conditions that repress PINA expression, the cells are delayed in the interphase activation of NIMX(cdc2), whereas they traverse the other phases of the cell cycle at a similar rate to controls. These results indicate that a marked reduction of PINA results in a lengthening of G(1). Additionally, PINA repression increases the rate at which the cells enter mitosis following release from a hydroxyurea arrest without altering the sensitivity of the fungus to agents that activate the replication or DNA damage checkpoints. In contrast to predictions based on Pin1, the physical interaction between PINA and NIMA is primarily dependent upon the prolylisomerase domain of PINA and the C-terminal 303 amino acids of NIMA. Finally, reduction of PINA levels exacerbates the nimA5 temperature-sensitive mutant, whereas overexpression of PINA decreases the severity of this mutation, results that are consistent with a positive genetic interaction between PINA and NIMA. Thus, although PINA is essential and positively regulates NIMA function, A. nidulans is most sensitive to a reduction in PINA concentration in G(1) rather than in G(2)/M.",2004,15178679,no
Detection of circulating galactomannan for the diagnosis and management of invasive aspergillosis.,"The availability of the Platelia Aspergillus, a sandwich ELISA kit that detects circulating galactomannan, has been a major advance for managing patients at risk for invasive aspergillosis because of the early detection of the antigen. The assay is now widely used throughout the world, including the USA. Although initial studies that assessed the performance characteristics of this assay reported high sensitivity and specificity, more recent studies show significant variation in performance. The causes of this variability are multifactorial and, in large part, cannot be explained because there is insufficient understanding of the kinetics of galactomannan in vivo. We explored some of the factors that affect the release of the aspergillus antigen that bears the epitope that reacts with the monoclonal antibody used in the ELISA, its leakage from the site of infection into the blood, and its binding to substances present in the blood. Factors that affect the detection of antigen in blood are also discussed, most notably the pretreatment procedure aimed at liberating the antigen from immune complexes. Understanding the biology of galactomannan release by aspergillus will greatly enhance our understanding of the kinetics of this and other surrogate markers and allow their optimum use in the management of invasive aspergillosis.",2004,15172343,no
Diagnosis of aspergillus peritonitis in a renal dialysis patient by PCR and galactomannan detection.,"This report describes the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and galactomannan detection to detect aspergillus in the continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) fluid and blood of a patient with multiple myeloma on CAPD and immunosuppressive treatment. Diagnosis of aspergillosis was initially made by conventional culture of CAPD fluid, but the PCR and galactomannan assays also detected aspergillus DNA and antigen in the blood, respectively. This suggests that the PCR and galactomannan assays, previously suggested as useful in the management of invasive fungal infections in neutropenic haematological patients, may be suitable for application to a broad range of clinical situations and sample types.",2004,15166279,no
Current molecular diagnostic approaches to systemic infections with aspergillus species in patients with hematological malignancies.,"Within the recent years, novel molecular methods, especially PCR assays, have been developed to improve the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in patients with malignant hematological diseases being at high risk for this life-threatening infection. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for adequate therapeutical management, which however, often remains difficult since most of the diagnostic tools used clinically at present either lack specificity or acceptable sensitivity. The clinical value, advantages and remaining problems of recently developed molecular approaches to detect the emerging fungal pathogen are reviewed.",2004,15160907,no
Transgenic rice plants expressing the antifungal AFP protein from Aspergillus giganteus show enhanced resistance to the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea.,"The Aspergillus giganteus antifungal protein (AFP), encoded by the afp gene, has been reported to possess in vitro antifungal activity against various economically important fungal pathogens, including the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea. In this study, transgenic rice ( Oryza sativa ) constitutively expressing the afp gene was generated by Agrobacterium -mediated transformation. Two different DNA constructs containing either the afp cDNA sequence from Aspergillus or a chemically synthesized codon-optimized afp gene were introduced into rice plants. In both cases, the DNA region encoding the signal sequence from the tobacco AP24 gene was N-terminally fused to the coding sequence of the mature AFP protein. Transgenic rice plants showed stable integration and inheritance of the transgene. No effect on plant morphology was observed in the afp -expressing rice lines. The inhibitory activity of protein extracts prepared from leaves of afp plants on the in vitro growth of M. grisea indicated that the AFP protein produced by the trangenic rice plants was biologically active. Several of the T(2) homozygous afp lines were challenged with M. grisea in a detached leaf infection assay. Transformants exhibited resistance to rice blast at various levels. Altogether, the results presented here indicate that AFP can be functionally expressed in rice plants for protection against the rice blast fungus M. grisea.",2004,15159626,no
Reactivity of platelia Aspergillus galactomannan antigen with piperacillin-tazobactam: clinical implications based on achievable concentrations in serum.,"The possible reactivities of commonly used antibiotics of fungal, nonfungal, and nonmicrobial or synthetic sources with the Platelia Aspergillus galactomannan assay were assessed. For drugs that tested positive, the minimal concentration of the antibiotic in serum that yielded a positive test (index, >0.5) was determined. At undiluted concentrations, piperacillin and multiple lots of piperacillin-tazobactam tested positive, whereas amoxicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam, nafcillin, cefazolin, ceftazidime, erythromycin, gentamicin, and levofloxacin tested negative. All three lots of piperacillin-tazobactam and all bags within each lot tested positive, with a mean index value of 5.168. At achievable concentrations in serum, however, only one of three lots of piperacillin-tazobactam yielded a positive test. Concentrations of 75, 150, and 300 microg/ml of serum tested positive with the Platelia Aspergillus enzyme immunoassay, whereas lower concentrations, mimicking the trough levels, tested negative. Thus, while achievable serum piperacillin-tazobactam concentrations may potentially result in a positive test for galactomannan, the timing of the collection of serum samples from patients may influence the test results, with reactivity being less likely in samples collected at trough levels or prior to the administration of a dose of the antibiotic.",2004,15155189,no
[Development of a rapid quantitative double mAb sandwich ELISA for detecting galactomannan antigen of aspergillus fumigatus].,"To develop a double mAb sandwich ELISA for rapidly and quantitatively detecting galactomannan (GM) antigen of aspergillus fumigatus.Four monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against GM of aspergillus fumigatus were used as coating or enzyme conjugated antibodies respectively. Capture and sandwich mAbs were selected by sandwich ELISA paired one by one.Optimal capture and sandwich mAbs were selected and a highly sensitive double sandwich ELISA established. The sensitivity of detecting GM reached 0.1 microg/L, the detectable range was 0.1-10 microg/L. Coefficient of variation (C.V) obtained from detecting the same sample for 6 times by ELISA was (7.2+/-3.8)%.A sensitive, repeatable and rapid double mAb sandwich ELISA was established for quantitation of aspergillus fumigatus GM, which might apply to early diagnosis and treatment of patients with aspergillosis.",2004,15155094,no
ELISA for early diagnosis of histoplasmosis.,"An ELISA was developed and evaluated as a method for detecting antibodies against glycosylated and deglycosylated histoplasmin (HMIN). Sera from patients with histoplasmosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, sporotrichosis, coccidioidomycosis, aspergillosis, cryptococcosis and healthy donors were tested by ELISA against purified, deglycosylated histoplasmin (ptHMIN) and compared with purified, native (i.e. glycosylated) histoplasmin (pHMIN). Although cross-reactivity was not abolished when ptHMIN was used in the test, it was reduced (pHMIN ELISA 93 % versus ptHMIN ELISA 96 %). However, there were statistically significant differences between the sensitivities of these two methods for the detection of antibodies (pHMIN ELISA 57 % versus ptHMIN ELISA 92 % P < 0.001) and between the efficiency of the methods (pHMIN ELISA 83 % versus ptHMIN ELISA 95 %",2004,15150330,no
Fusion proteins comprising a Fusarium-specific antibody linked to antifungal peptides protect plants against a fungal pathogen.,"In planta expression of recombinant antibodies recognizing pathogen-specific antigens has been proposed as a strategy for crop protection. We report the expression of fusion proteins comprising a Fusarium-specific recombinant antibody linked to one of three antifungal peptides (AFPs) as a method for protecting plants against fungal diseases. A chicken-derived single-chain antibody specific to antigens displayed on the Fusarium cell surface was isolated from a pooled immunocompetent phage display library. This recombinant antibody inhibited fungal growth in vitro when fused to any of the three AFPs. Expression of the fusion proteins in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants conferred high levels of protection against Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. matthiolae, whereas plants expressing either the fungus-specific antibody or AFPs alone exhibited only moderate resistance. Our results demonstrate that antibody fusion proteins may be used as effective and versatile tools for the protection of crop plants against fungal infection.",2004,15146196,no
Antibodies to molds and satratoxin in individuals exposed in water-damaged buildings.,"Immunoglobulin (Ig)A, IgM, and IgG antibodies against Penicillium notatum, Aspergillus niger, Stachybotrys chartarum, and satratoxin H were determined in the blood of 500 healthy blood donor controls, 500 random patients, and 500 patients with known exposure to molds. The patients were referred to the immunological testing laboratory for health reasons other than mold exposure, or for measurement of mold antibody levels. Levels of IgA, IgM, and IgG antibodies against molds were significantly greater in the patients (p < 0.001 for all measurements) than in the controls. However, in mold-exposed patients, levels of these antibodies against satratoxin differed significantly for IgG only (p < 0.001), but not for IgM or IgA. These differences in the levels of mold antibodies among the 3 groups were confirmed by calculation of z score and by Scheffé's significant difference tests. A general linear model was applied in the majority of cases, and 3 different subsets were formed, meaning that the healthy control groups were different from the random patients and from the mold-exposed patients. These findings indicated that mold exposure was more common in patients who were referred for immunological evaluation than it was in healthy blood donors. The detection of antibodies to molds and satratoxin H likely resulted from antigenic stimulation of the immune system and the reaction of serum with specially prepared mold antigens. These antigens, which had high protein content, were developed in this laboratory and used in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedure. The authors concluded that the antibodies studied are specific to mold antigens and mycotoxins, and therefore could be useful in epidemiological and other studies of humans exposed to molds and mycotoxins.",2004,15143855,no
"Use of a synthetic peptide epitope of Asp f 1, a major allergen or antigen of Aspergillus fumigatus, for improved immunodiagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.","Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is an immunologically complex allergic disorder caused by the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Elevated levels of total immunoglobulin E (IgE), specific IgE, and IgG antibodies in sera are important immunodiagnostic criteria for ABPA. International reference standards or standardized immunodiagnostic assays are not available due to a lack of well-defined diagnostic antigens. The present study was carried out to identify and evaluate the immunodiagnostic relevance of synthetic epitopic peptides of Asp f 1, a major allergen, antigen, or cytotoxin of A. fumigatus. Five overlapping peptides were synthesized from the N terminus of Asp f 1, one of the potential immunodominant regions predicted by algorithmic programs. The 11-amino-acid synthetic peptide (P1) significantly inhibited both IgG binding (89.10% +/- 4.45%) and IgE binding (77.32% +/- 3.38%) of the standardized diagnostic antigen (SDA) (a well-defined pool of diagnostically relevant allergens and antigens of A. fumigatus). With a panel of sera of ABPA patients, allergic patients with skin test negativity to A. fumigatus, and healthy individuals, P1 showed a higher diagnostic efficiency than SDA (specific IgG, 100% specific IgE, 98.3%). The diagnostic efficiency of P1 could be attributed to the presence of homologous epitopes in various immunodominant allergens or antigens of A. fumigatus. The ability of P1 to induce histamine release from sensitized mast cells and a Th2 type of cytokine profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of ABPA patients suggests its potential for use in intradermal testing. P1 could be further explored for development of a standardized, specific, and sensitive immunodiagnostic test for aspergillosis.",2004,15138181,no
AFMP2 encodes a novel immunogenic protein of the antigenic mannoprotein superfamily in Aspergillus fumigatus.,"We cloned the Aspergillus fumigatus mannoprotein 2 (AFMP2) gene, which encodes a novel immunogenic protein (Afmp2p) of the antigenic mannoprotein superfamily, in A. fumigatus. Sequence analysis revealed that Afmp2p has 510 amino acid residues, with a predicted molecular mass of 51.5 kDa. Afmp2p has a putative N-terminal signal peptide, a putative C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane attachment signal sequence, and an upstream GAA cleavage site commonly used for cytoplasmic membrane attachment and implicated in fungal cell wall assembly. Upstream of the GAA cleavage site, Afmp2p contains a 302-amino-acid serine- and threonine-rich region as a site for potential O-glycosylation. Within this serine- and threonine-rich region, 13 repeats of ETSTPCE(T)(n) were observed. Western blot analysis of Afmp2p in A. fumigatus fungal cell lysate and culture supernatant and immunogold staining and electron microscopy showed that Afmp2p is predominantly secreted into the culture supernatant, whereas only minimal amounts can be detected in the cell lysate and cell wall. Finally, it was observed that patients with aspergilloma and invasive aspergillosis due to A. fumigatus develop a specific antibody response against recombinant Afmp2p. The abundance of Afmp2p in secreted form, its minimal cross-reactivity with Afmp1p, and the presence of an antibody response against Afmp2p in patients with A. fumigatus infections suggest that Afmp2p is a good candidate for complementing Afmp1p in serodiagnosis of A. fumigatus infections.",2004,15131215,no
Nitrate reductase activity is required for nitrate uptake into fungal but not plant cells.,"The ability to transport net nitrate was conferred upon transformant cells of the non-nitrate-assimilating yeast Pichia pastoris after the introduction of two genes, one encoding nitrate reductase and the other nitrate transport. It was observed that cells of this lower eukaryote transformed with the nitrate transporter gene alone failed to display net nitrate transport despite having the ability to produce the protein. In addition, loss-of-function nitrate reductase mutants isolated from several nitrate-assimilating fungi appeared to be unable to accumulate nitrate. Uptake assays using the tracer (13)NO(3)(-) showed that nitrate influx is negligible in cells of a nitrate reductase null mutant. In parallel studies using a higher eukaryotic plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, loss-of-function nitrate reductase strains homozygous for both NIA1 insertion and NIA2 deletion were found to have no detectable nitrate reductase mRNA or nitrate reductase activity but retained the ability to transport nitrate. The reasons for these fundamental differences in nitrate transport into the cells of representative members of these two eukaryotic kingdoms are discussed.",2004,15123642,no
Differences among the cell wall galactomannans from Aspergillus wentii and Chaetosartorya chrysella and that of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"The alkali extractable and water-soluble cell wall polysaccharides F1SS from Aspergillus wentii and Chaetosartorya chrysella have been studied by methylation analysis, 1D- and 2D-NMR, and MALDI-TOF analysis. Their structures are almost identical, corresponding to the following repeating unit: [--> 3)-beta-D-Gal f -(1 --> 5)-beta-D-Gal f-(1 -->]n --> mannan core. The structure of this galactofuranose side chain differs from that found in the pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, in other Aspergillii and members of Trichocomaceae: [--> 5)-beta-D-Gal f-(1 -->]n --> mannan core. The mannan cores have also been investigated, and are constituted by a (1 --> 6)-alpha-mannan backbone, substituted at positions 2 by chains from 1 to 7 residues of (1 --> 2) linked alpha-mannopyranoses.",2004,15115908,no
Detection of Aspergillus galactomannan by enzyme immunoabsorbent assay in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a prospective study.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) has become the leading infectious cause of death after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). This is partially because of the lack of a sensitive, specific, and noninvasive diagnostic test. New diagnostic tests for IA, such as the detection of Aspergillus galactomannan antigen (AGA) by sandwich enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA), have recently been described. This study validates the usefulness of this diagnostic tool in the allo-HSCT setting.From January 1999 to January 2001, all consecutive adult patients undergoing allo-HSCT were prospectively studied with a galactomannan antigenemia assay (ELISA test) twice weekly from admission until death or discharge, and weekly afterward if the patient received immunosuppressive therapy. Proven, probable, and possible IA were defined according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group criteria.During the 2 years of study, 74 patients underwent an allo-HSCT. A total of 832 serum samples were collected. According to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group criteria, it was ascertained that 66 patients did not fulfill any criteria of IA, 2 patients were classified with possible IA, 5 patients were classified with probable IA, and 1 patient was classified with proven IA. Fourteen samples were positive for AGA, all from patients with IA. The sensitivity and specificity of the test were 75% and 100%, respectively. The positive predictive and negative predictive values were 100% and 97%, respectively.In this study, AGA detection was clearly related to IA. Although the ELISA test did not have any role in the anticipation of the diagnosis, it clarifies the diagnosis of IA in allo-HSCT.",2004,15114095,yes
Cloning and sequencing of a cDNA expressing a ribosomal P0 peptide from Culicoides nubeculosus (Diptera).,"Insect bite dermal hypersensitivity (IBH) is an allergic dermatitis of horses caused by bites of Culicoides spp. and sometimes Simulium spp. The aim of the investigation presented here was to identify allergens causing IBH. A cDNA library expressing recombinant Culicoides nubeculosus proteins was screened using affinity-purified serum from an IBH-affected horse. Screening of the library resulted in identification of one immunoreactive clone. The sequence of the cDNA insert was determined and revealed a 600 bp insert with an open reading frame coding for a 78 amino acid long protein, called rCul n 1. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed an identity of 67-78% to the C-terminal part of the 318 amino acid long ribosomal P0 protein from other Diptera. Furthermore, the 38 C-terminal amino acids displayed an identity of 57% with the C-terminal part of the acidic ribosomal protein P2 from Aspergillus fumigatus. The cDNA insert was subcloned and expressed as a [His]6-tagged protein in Escherichia coli and purified using Ni2(+)-chelate affinity chromatography. The 10kDa recombinant Cul n 1 protein bound the affinity-purified antibody fraction used for screening the expression library. Determination of IgE and IgG levels against rCul n 1 by ELISA in sera from 19 IBH-affected and 18 Swiss control horses and in sera from eight control horses living in Iceland showed no significant differences between the three groups of horses (median IgE levels = 60, 49 and 44 relative ELISA units, respectively). rCul n 1 did not induce sulfidoleukotriene (sLT) release from peripheral blood leukocytes of IBH-affected horses (N = 5), although sLT release was induced with the Culicoides whole body extract.",2004,15113658,no
Comparison of cultural and analytical methods for determination of aflatoxin production by Mississippi Delta Aspergillus isolates.,"This study compared cultural and analytical methods for detecting aflatoxin production by Aspergillus species. Aspergillus isolates were obtained from various Mississippi Delta crops (corn, peanut, rice, cotton) and soils. Most of the isolates (99%) were A. flavus and the remainder comprised A. parasiticus and A. nomius. The following three cultural methods were evaluated on potato dextrose agar: fluorescence (FL) on beta-cyclodextrin-containing media (CD), yellow pigment (YP) formation in mycelium and medium, and color change after ammonium hydroxide vapor exposure (AV). Aflatoxins in culture extracts were confirmed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Of the 517 isolates, 314 produced greater than 20 ng/g of total aflatoxin based on ELISA, and 180 produced greater than 10 000 ng/g of aflatoxin in the medium. Almost all the toxigenic isolates (97%) were confirmed by TLC as producers. Of the toxigenic isolates, as determined by ELISA, 93%, 73%, and 70% gave positive FL, YP, and AV responses, respectively. Of the 203 isolates producing less than 20 ng/g of aflatoxin, 20%, 6%, and 0% of respective FL, YP, and AV methods gave false-positive responses. The 9% false-positive results from TLC fall within this range. This study showed good agreement among all tested cultural methods. However, these cultural techniques did not detect aflatoxin in all cultures that were found to produce aflatoxins by ELISA, LC/MS, and TLC. The best results were obtained when the AV color change and CD fluorescence methods were used together, yielding an overall success rate comparable to TLC but without the need for chemical extraction and the time and expense of TLC.",2004,15105886,no
Screening for microtubule-disrupting antifungal agents by using a mitotic-arrest mutant of Aspergillus nidulans and novel action of phenylalanine derivatives accompanying tubulin loss.,"The microtubule, which is one of the major targets of anthelmintics, anticancer drugs, and fungicides, is composed mainly of alpha- and beta-tubulins. We focused on a unique characteristic of an Aspergillus nidulans benA33 mutant to screen for microtubule-disrupting antifungal agents. This mutant, which has a beta-tubulin with a mutation of a single amino acid, undergoes mitotic arrest due to the formation of hyperstable microtubules at 37 degrees C. The heat sensitivity of the mutant is remedied by some antimicrotubule agents. We found that an agar plate assay with the mutant was able to distinguish three types of microtubule inhibitors. The growth recovery zones of the mutant were formed around paper disks containing microtubule inhibitors, including four benzimidazoles, ansamitocin P-3, griseofulvin, and rhizoxin, on the agar plate at 37 degrees C. Nocodazole, thiabendazole, and griseofulvin reversed the mitotic arrest of the mutant and promoted its hyphal growth. Ansamitocin P-3 and rhizoxin showed growth recovery zones around the growth-inhibitory zones. Benomyl and carbendazim also reversed mitotic arrest but produced weaker growth recovery than the aforementioned drugs. Other microtubule inhibitors, such as colchicine, Colcemid, paclitaxel, podophyllotoxin, TN-16, vinblastine, and vincristine, as well as some cytoskeletal inhibitors tested, did not show such activity. In our screening, we newly identified two mycotoxins, citrinin and patulin, two sesquiterpene dialdehydes, polygodial and warburganal, and four phenylalanine derivatives, arphamenine A, L-2,5-dihydrophenylalanine (DHPA), N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethylketone, and N-carbobenzoxy-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone. In a wild-type strain of A. nidulans, DHPA caused selective losses of microtubules, as determined by fluorescence microscopy, and of both alpha- and beta-tubulins, as determined by Western blot analysis. This screening method involving the benA33 mutant of A. nidulans is useful, convenient, and highly selective. The phenylalanine derivatives tested are of a novel type of microtubule-disrupting antifungal agents, producing an accompanying loss of tubulins, and are different from well-known tubulin inhibitors affecting the assembly of tubulin dimers into microtubules.",2004,15105129,no
Feasibility of radioimmunotherapy of experimental pneumococcal infection.,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important cause of community-acquired pneumonia, meningitis, and bacteremia. The problem of pneumococcal disease is exacerbated by increasing drug resistance. Furthermore, patients with impaired immunity are at high risk for invasive pneumococcal infections. Thus, there is an urgent need for new approaches to antimicrobial therapy. Antibody therapies take advantage of the specificity and high affinity of the antigen-antibody interaction to deliver antibacterial compounds to a site of infection in the form of naked or conjugated antibodies. We have recently established that radioimmunotherapy (RIT) can be used to treat experimental fungal infections in mice. In the present study, we investigated the feasibility of applying a RIT approach to the treatment of S. pneumoniae infection by evaluating the susceptibility of S. pneumoniae to radiolabeled antibody in vitro and in an animal infection model. For the specific antibody carrier, we used human monoclonal antibody D11, which binds to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide 8. We have selected the alpha particle emitter (213)Bi as the radionuclide for conjugation to the antibody. Incubation of serotype 8 S. pneumoniae with (213)Bi-D11 resulted in dose-dependent killing of bacteria. RIT of S. pneumoniae infection in C57BL/6 mice showed that 60% more mice survived in the (213)Bi-D11-treated group (80 micro Ci) than in the untreated group (P < 0.01). The treatment did not cause hematological toxicity, as demonstrated by platelet counts. This feasibility study establishes that RIT can be applied to the treatment of bacterial infections.",2004,15105113,no
Prospective assessment of Platelia Aspergillus galactomannan antigen for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in lung transplant recipients.,"The clinical utility of Platelia trade mark Aspergillus galactomannan antigen for the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis was prospectively assessed in 70 consecutive lung transplant recipients. Sera were collected twice weekly and tested for galactomannan. Invasive aspergillosis was documented in 17.1% (12/70) of the patients. Using the generalized estimating equation model, at the cutoff value of >or= 0.5, the sensitivity of the test was 30%, specificity 93% with positive and negative likelihood ratios of 4.2 and 0.75, respectively. Increasing the cutoff value to >or= 0.66 yielded a sensitivity of 30%, specificity of 95%, and positive and negative likelihood ratios of 5.5 and 0.74. A total of 14 patients had false-positive tests, including nine who had cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. False-positive tests occurred within 3 days of transplantation in 43% (6/14) of the patients, and within 7 days in 64% (9/14). Thus, the test demonstrated excellent specificity, but a low sensitivity for the diagnosis of aspergillosis in this patient population. Patients with cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may transiently have a positive test in the early post-transplant period.",2004,15084177,no
[Role and importance of fungal infections in intensive care units].,"The incidence of fungal infections is constantly increasing, especially in Intensive Care Units (ICU). On the one hand ICU are places for treatment of most difficult, often immunodeficient patients, and on the other hand their treatment often requires invasive procedures, support of vital organs and adequate monitoring.In approximately 78% of patients the cause of infection are Candida species with mortality rate of 57%. Less common causative agents are Aspergillus species, but with very high mortality rate of up to 100%.Candida albicans is a normal inhabitant of the oropharygeal and digestive systems. Hospitalization, trauma, loss of immunity and use of strong antibiotics facilitate fungal colonization. Inadequate nutrition, poor perfusion, ischemia and corticosteroid therapy lead to damage of intestinal mucosa. Combined with improper production of IG A, it predisposes to translocation of fungi through mucosa and invasion of the blood stream.Most common forms are urinary tract infections, intrabdominal candidiasis, disseminated candidiasis and candidemia.Diagnosis of fungal infections is very difficult. It is based on clinical picture, microbiological, histological, radiological, serologic and molecular examinations.Treatment is usually based on systemic antimycotic agents (Amphotericin B, Azoles: Fluconazole, Flucytosine). Prophylactic treatment is still a matter of debate. It is not routinely recommended in ICU, but is commonly used in transplant patients.",2004,15080046,no
"Prospective clinical evaluation of a LightCycler-mediated polymerase chain reaction assay, a nested-PCR assay and a galactomannan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of invasive aspergillosis in neutropenic cancer patients and haematological stem cell transplant recipients.","Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a considerable clinical problem in neutropenic patients with haematological malignancies but its diagnosis remains difficult. We prospectively evaluated a LightCycler polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, a nested-PCR assay and a galactomannan (GM) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to validate their significance in diagnosing IA. During 205 treatment episodes in 165 patients from six centres, a nested-PCR assay and GM testing was performed at regular intervals. Positive nested-PCR results were quantified by a LightCycler PCR assay. Patient episodes were stratified according to the 2002 European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycosis Study Group consensus criteria and the PCR and serology results were correlated with the clinical diagnostic classification. Sensitivity and specificity rates for the nested-PCR assay were up to 63.6% [95% confidence interval (CI): 30.8-89%) and 63.5% (95% CI: 53.4-72.7%) respectively, and 33.3% and 98.9% (95% CI: 7.5-70.1% and 94.2-99.9%) for GM respectively. The LightCycler PCR assay yielded positive results in 21.4%, lacking discrimination by quantification across the different clinical categories. In this prospective comparison, PCR was superior to GM with respect to sensitivity rates. In patients at high risk for IA, positive results for Aspergillus by PCR of blood samples are highly suggestive for IA and contribute to the diagnosis.",2004,15059142,yes
Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis: A study of 39 cases at autopsy.,"Aspergillus is a common cause of invasive mycosis, especially in immunocompromised or immunosuppressed individuals.To study the incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and evaluate the predisposing factors and clinico-pathological manifestations.Retrospective analysis of autopsy material from a tertiary care hospital.All autopsies performed over a 12-year period were reviewed and cases with invasive aspergillosis were analysed with respect to their clinical presentation, predisposing factors, gross and histological features, complications and causes of death.Among a total of 20475 autopsies performed in 12 years, 39 patients (0.19 %) had invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. There were 28 males and 11 females. Their ages ranged from five months to 67 years. Dyspnoea, fever, cough with mucopurulent expectoration, chest pain and haemoptysis were commonly encountered symptoms. Forty-one per cent of the patients had no respiratory symptoms. Fungal aetiology was not entertained clinically in any of the patients. The major underlying conditions were prolonged antibiotic therapy, steroid therapy, and renal transplantation, often associated with underlying lung diseases. Pneumonia, abscesses, vascular thrombosis and infarction were common findings at autopsy. Antecedent tuberculosis, mucormycosis, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and Cytomegalovirus infection were also present. In most cases, death was related to extensive pulmonary involvement or fungal dissemination.A diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis should always be borne in mind whenever one is dealing with recalcitrant lung infections even with subtle immunosuppression. Radiological investigations and serologic markers can be utilised for confirmation and prompt therapy.",2004,15047994,no
"Efficacy, safety, and plasma pharmacokinetics of escalating dosages of intravenously administered ravuconazole lysine phosphoester for treatment of experimental pulmonary aspergillosis in persistently neutropenic rabbits.","Ravuconazole is a new antifungal triazole with broad-spectrum activity and a long half-life in plasma. We studied the antifungal efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of ravuconazole lysine phosphoester in escalating dosages for the treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis due to Aspergillus fumigatus in persistently neutropenic rabbits. Treatment groups consisted of rabbits treated with ravuconazole at 2.5 (RVC2.5), 5 (RVC5), and 10 (RVC10) mg/kg of body weight/day, rabbits treated with amphotericin B (AMB) at 1 mg/kg/day, or untreated controls. There was a dose-dependent reduction of pulmonary residual fungal burden (CFU per gram) in RVC5-, RVC10-, and AMB-treated rabbits in comparison to untreated controls (P < 0.01, P < 0.001, and P < 0.01, respectively). These findings correlated with progressive galactomannan antigenemia in untreated controls and the RVC2.5-treated rabbits, a lower galactomannan index (GMI) in RVC5- and RVC10-treated rabbits, and a similarly low GMI in AMB-treated rabbits (P < 0.01). Rabbits treated with RVC5, RVC10, and AMB also showed a reduction of organism-mediated pulmonary injury, as measured by infarct scores and lung weights, in comparison to untreated controls (P < 0.001). These results were supported by decreased pulmonary infiltrates detected by computed tomography in RVC5- and RVC10-treated rabbits in comparison to untreated controls (P < 0.05). Survival throughout the entire study was achieved in 95% of RVC5-treated rabbits (P < 0.001), 85% of RVC10-treated rabbits (P < 0.001), and 50% of AMB-treated rabbits (P < 0.05) in comparison to none of the untreated controls. Ravuconazole showed linear plasma pharmacokinetics and a large volume of distribution while maintaining concentrations in plasma above the MIC throughout the dosing interval. There was no evidence of hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity among ravuconazole-treated animals. Intravenously administered ravuconazole lysine phosphoester showed dose-dependent efficacy and an excellent safety profile for the treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in persistently neutropenic rabbits.",2004,15047519,no
Procalcitonin serum levels in perinatal bacterial and fungal infection of preterm infants.,"To determine reference values for procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) for gestational age and to use these parameters as diagnostic markers of perinatal bacterial and fungal infection.PCT and CRP serum levels were measured in a case-control study in a group of 35 low birthweight infants (< 34 wk of gestation). 27 babies (77%) had clinical signs of infection confirmed by positive blood cultures and were compared to 8 (23%) uninfected matched patients. Seventeen (63%) of them had bacterial infection and 10 (37%) had fungal infection (Candida). Serum PCT (Brahms Diagnostika) and CRP (Immunoassay Vitros 950) were measured serially at 3, 7 and 10d of life.At any time, PCT and CRP levels were significantly higher in neonates with perinatal infection (p < 0.05) (> 0.7 ng ml(-1) and > 1 mg dl(-1) respectively). PCT showed a more rapid response to infection (9.3 +/- 1.5 ng ml(-1)). especially to bacterial infection (10.8 +/- 1.4 ng ml(-1)), than CRP (1.5 +/- 0.5 mg dl(-1)) (sensitivity 99% vs 88%). Lower sensitivity was noted for both parameters. PCT and CRP, to follow babies with fungal infection (6.7 +/- 0.8 ng ml(-1) and 0.9 +/- 0.7 mg dl(-1), respectively) (sensitivity 77% vs 58%).This study gives PCT reference values in preterm babies with perinatal infection. In these babies, PCT seems to be more sensitive than CRP as a diagnostic marker of infection. Both parameters can be used alone or in combination for a better identification and follow-up of bacterial and fungal infection during the perinatal period.",2004,15046277,no
Salivary secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor and oral candidiasis in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected persons.,"Oropharyngeal candidiasis, typically caused by Candida albicans, is the most common oral disease associated with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), a 12-kDa antiprotease, suppresses the growth of C. albicans in vitro. To determine whether the mucosal protein plays a role in protecting oral tissues against fungal infection, we conducted a cross-sectional study investigating the oral and systemic health and salivary SLPI levels in 91 dentate HIV-1-infected adults receiving medical care in the southeastern United States. Participants with a self-reported history of clinical oropharyngeal candidiasis during the previous 2 years constituted the test group (n = 52), while the comparison group (n = 39) had no oropharyngeal candidiasis during that period. Data collected from medical records, oral examination, and SLPI enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay quantitation of whole saliva were analyzed by t test, analysis of variance, linear regression, and unconditional logistic regression. The test group had a significantly higher mean salivary SLPI level than the comparison group (1.9 microg/ml versus 1.1 microg/ml, P < 0.05). Linear regression modeling identified CD4 cell count and history of oropharyngeal candidiasis as key predictors of salivary SLPI and revealed a significant interaction (P < 0.05) between immunosuppression (CD4 cell count below 200 cells/ microl) and positive history of oropharyngeal candidiasis in predicting salivary SLPI level. By logistic regression modeling, a salivary SLPI level exceeding 2.1 microg/ml, low CD4 count, antiretroviral monotherapy, and smoking were key predictors of oropharyngeal candidiasis. These data support a key role for SLPI in the oral mucosal defense against C. albicans. The antimicrobial mucosal protein may serve as an indicator of previous oropharyngeal candidiasis infection among immunosuppressed persons.",2004,15039315,no
Prevalence of aspergillosis in bronchogenic carcinoma.,"Bronchoalveolar lavage of 42 patients of bronchogenic carcinoma was studied to find out the prevalence of aspergillosis. Sera of the patients were also analysed for presence of anti-Aspergillus antibodies by Immunodiffusion (ID), Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and dot blot assay (DBA). Aspergillus was isolated in culture from 6 (14.2%) patients of bronchogenic carcinoma. Aspergillus fumigatus was the predominant species isolated. All the strains of Aspergillus were sensitive to itraconazole, ketoconazole and amphotericin B while resistance (33.3%) was found with fluconazole. Anti-aspergillus antibodies were detected equally by ID, ELISA and DBA in 9 (21.4%) cases. The present study revealed prevalence and seroprevalance of Aspergillus in bronchogenic carcinoma to be 14.2% and 21.4% respectively. Consistent reactivity against 18 kDa Aspergillus fumigatus antigen was noted in serologically positive cases. Antibodies against 18 kDa protein antigen in western blotting may be used as a reference marker for diagnosis of aspergillosis in bronchogenic carcinoma. It is also suggested that the simplest serological technique like ID may be performed along with culture for diagnosing Aspergillosis in patients of bronchogenic carcinoma since ID, ELISA and DBA showed similar sensitivity.",2004,15025326,no
[Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in immunocompromized children: diagnosis and classification].,"Invasive aspergillosis is an opportunistic infection, with frequent lung involvement. High-risk children are allogenic bone marrow recipients, and those with hematological malignancies, aplastic anemia or chronic granulomatous disease. Profound and prolonged neutropenia, and corticosteroid therapy are the most important predisposing factors. Building and demolition works represent the major environmental risk factor. The diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis remains difficult to establish. Clinical manifestations are non-specific. Early thoracic computed tomographic scan shows halo sign in most cases. Subsequently appears the air crescent sign. Galactomannan research by sandwich ELISA can be useful in serum and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Aspergillus DNA detection by PCR is still not standardized. Culture of the organism allows species identification. Aspergillus hyphae can be found at cytological examination, but a biopsy specimen is usually required to affirm tissue damage. A new classification of invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised patients was recently proposed by experts from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and from the Mycoses Study Group of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. On the basis of host linked criteria, microbiological, clinical and radiological features, invasive aspergillosis is classified as proven, probable or possible. These definitions should not be used to guide clinical practice in therapy, but they will improve the quality of epidemiological data, and help the comparison of clinical trial results.",2004,15022785,no
"Nek8, a NIMA family kinase member, is overexpressed in primary human breast tumors.","The family of human Nek (NIMA Related Kinase) kinases currently contains 11 members. We have identified Nek8 as a new member of the Nek kinase family. For many of the Nek family members, primary tumor expression data and function have been limited. However, all of the Nek family proteins share considerable homology with the Never In Mitosis, gene A (NIMA) kinase from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. NIMA, as well as its most closely related human ortholog, Nek2, are required for G(2)/M progression and promote centrosome maturation during mitosis. We isolated Nek8 from a primary human colon cDNA library, and found it to be highly homologous to murine Nek8. Recently, a previously named Nek8 sequence was renamed Nek9/Nercc1 in Genbank due to its lack of homology to murine Nek8 and its high homology to murine Nek9. Interestingly, in our study, phylogenetic analysis suggests that human Nek8 and Nek9 form a subfamily within the Nek family. Nek8 has high homology to the Nek family kinase domain as well as to a regulator of chromosome condensation domain (RCC1), which is also present in Nek9. The open reading frame of human Nek8 encodes a 692 amino-acid protein with a calculated molecular weight of 75 kDa. Nek8 is differently expressed between normal human breast tissue and breast tumors. Overexpression of a mutated kinase domain Nek8 in U2-0S cells led to a decrease in actin protein, and a small increase in the level of cdk1/cyclinB1. Our data demonstrate for the first time that Nek8 is a novel tumor associated gene, and shares considerable sequence homology with the Nek family of protein kinases and may be involved in G(2)/M progression.",2004,15019993,no
Circulating beta (1-3) glucan and immunoglobulin G subclass antibodies to Candida albicans cell wall antigens in patients with systemic candidiasis.,"Invasive candidiasis in patients who are immunocompromised or in intensive care units (ICUs) presents both diagnostic and therapeutic problems. We previously described antibodies that were directed against Candida albicans cell wall fragments (CW), periodate-treated CW (CW(IO4)), phosphopeptidomannan (PPM), and beta(1-3) glucan. In this study, circulating fungal antigens [mannan and beta(1-3) glucan] and immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass antibodies to these cell wall antigens (anti-CW) were analyzed in patients with systemic candidiasis. Sera were collected from 14 patients on two or three consecutive occasions, starting on the day when candidiasis was culture proven. The sera were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The control groups consisted of lactating mothers (n = 9) (group I) who had breast milk that was positive for C. albicans and also had acute inflammation of the nipples, and age-matched blood donors (n = 10) (group II). Within the first 3 weeks of Candida infection all of the patients were positive for beta(1-3) glucan by the Gluspecy test, but no patients were positive for mannan in the less-sensitive Pastorex Candida test. The controls were negative for both beta(1-3) glucan (<20 pg/ml) and mannan (<2.5 ng/ml). IgG1 anti-CW and IgG2 anti-PPM antibodies were the most discriminatory antibodies. The ratio of IgG1 anti-CW to IgG2 anti-PPM was significantly lower in nonsurviving patients than in the other patients within the first week of candidiasis (P = 0.019). The IgG2 levels of anti-CW(IO4) and antiglucan antibodies correlated strongly (r = 0.681 P < 0.0001), and the absence of these antibodies was associated with increased levels of beta(1-3) glucan. Increased levels of IgG1 anti-CW or IgG2 anti-PPM antibodies (titer of > or = 3 logs) or of a combination of the two antibodies (log sum, > or = 5) showed 92% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and positive predictive values. In conclusion, beta(1-3) glucan and the two subclass antibodies appear to be early specific markers for the laboratory diagnosis of candidiasis. Furthermore, the kinetics of beta(1-3) glucan appearance in serum may assist in evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of antifungal treatments.",2004,15013986,no
Role of C-terminal cysteine residues of Aspergillus fumigatus allergen Asp f 4 in immunoglobulin E binding.,"Among the several allergens cloned and expressed from Aspergillus fumigatus, Asp f 4 is a major one associated with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). The structure-function relationship of allergens is important in understanding the immunopathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of allergic diseases. These include the epitopes, conformational or linear, deletion of the N or C terminus or both N and C termini, and glycosylation or nonglycosylation, all of which affect immune responses. Similarly, the role of cysteine residues present in allergens may yield useful information regarding the conformational structure of allergens and the immunoglobulin E (IgE) epitope interaction. Such information may help in developing new strategies towards immunotherapy. In order to define the role of cysteine in the interaction of the antibody with Asp f 4, we have constructed mutants by selectively deleting cysteine residues from the C-terminal region of the Asp f 4. Immunological evaluation of these engineered recombinant constructs was conducted by using sera from patients with ABPA, Aspergillus skin test-positive asthmatics, and healthy controls. The results demonstrate strong IgE binding with Asp f 4 and two truncated mutants, Asp f 4(1-234) (amino acids [aa] 1 to 234) and Asp f 4(1-241) (aa 1 to 241), while another mutant, Asp f 4(1-196) (aa 1 to 196), showed reactivity with fewer patients. The result suggests that deletion of cysteines and the alteration of IgE epitopes at the C-terminal end resulted in conformational changes, which may have a potential role in the immunomodulation of the disease.",2004,15013973,no
Treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam and false-positive Aspergillus galactomannan antigen test results for patients with hematological malignancies.,"We report the occurrence of a high rate of false-positive test results during the surveillance of hematology patients for galactomannan (GM) antigenemia. Among 218 patients surveyed from June 2002 through June 2003, 42 (19.3%) had > or =1 serum sample positive for GM (optical density index, >1.5). Of these patients, 38 had no additional evidence of invasive aspergillosis, and, therefore, their test results were considered to be false-positives. Case-control analysis showed that treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam was the only risk factor significantly associated with receiving false-positive test results. When tested for GM antigen, 3 of 4 piperacillin-tazobactam batches had positive results. Physicians should be aware of the possible interference of treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam when interpreting the results of the GM assay.",2004,14999641,yes
False-positive galactomannan platelia Aspergillus test results for patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam.,"At the bone marrow transplantation center of the San Martino Hospital (Genoa), we observed an increase in the rate of patients with positive Platelia Aspergillus (PA Bio-Rad) test results, from 10% (38 of 386 patients) in the period from January 1999 through January 2003 to 36% (21 of 59 patients) in the period from February 2003 through May 2003. Positivity was significantly (P<.001) associated with the administration of piperacillin-tazobactam (PT) (17 [74%] of 23 patients who received PT had positive results vs. 4 [11%] of 36 who did not receive PT).

Identification of medically important fungi by the Pyrosequencing technology.,"The Pyrosequencing technology was used for identification of different clinically relevant fungi. The tests were performed on amplicons derived from the 18S rRNA gene using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) universal primers for amplification. Sequencing was performed up to 40 bases in a variable region with a designed general sequencing primer and the Pyrosequence data were analyzed by BLAST sequence search in the GenBank database. DNA from a total of 21 fungal specimens consisting of nine strains of clinically relevant fungi and 12 clinical specimens from patients suffering from proven invasive fungal infections were PCR-amplified and analyzed by gel electrophoresis, PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the Pyrosequencing technology. All data obtained by the Pyrosequencing technology were in agreement with the results obtained by PCR-ELISA using species/genus-specific oligonucleotides and were as well in accordance with the culture results. The results demonstrate that the Pyrosequencing method is a reproducible and reliable technique for identification of fungal pathogens.",2004,14998396,no
Antibodies against molds and mycotoxins following exposure to toxigenic fungi in a water-damaged building.,"Exposure to molds in water-damaged buildings can cause allergy, asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, mucus membrane irritation, and toxicity--alone or in combination. Despite this, significant emphasis has been placed only on Type I allergy and asthma, but not on the other 3 types of allergies. In this study, we sought to evaluate simultaneous measurements of immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgM, IgA, and IgE antibodies against the most common molds, and their mycotoxins, cultured from water-damaged buildings. Antibodies against 7 different molds and 2 mycotoxins were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the blood of 40 controls and 40 mold-exposed patients. The IgG antibody levels against all 7 of the molds used, as well as the 2 mycotoxins, were significantly greater in patients than in controls. The IgM antibody levels were significantly different in patients for only 6 of 9 determinations. Regarding IgA determinations, antibodies were elevated significantly against all antigens tested, except Epicoccum. However, the differences in IgE levels in controls and mold-exposed patients were significant only for Aspergillus and satratoxin. These differences implied that, overall, the healthy control group was different from the mold-exposed patients for IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies, but not for the IgE anti-mold antibody. Most patients with high levels of antibodies against various mold antigens also exhibited elevated antibodies against purified mycotoxins, indicating that the patients had been exposed to mold spores and mycotoxins. Detection of high levels (colony-forming units per cubic meter) of molds--which, in this study, strongly suggested that there existed a reservoir of spores in the building at the time of sampling--along with a significant elevation in IgG, IgM, or IgA antibodies against molds and mycotoxins, could be used in future epidemiologic investigations of fungal exposure. In addition to IgE, measurements of IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies should be considered in mold-exposed individuals.",2004,14992307,no
Rapid diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis by antigen detection.,"Aspergillosis is a serious and often fatal infection in the bone marrow or organ transplant patient, for which improved methods of diagnosis are desperately needed. Currently, the diagnosis is most often made based on clinical findings and radiographic findings, which are nonspecific, and toxic therapies are initiated empirically, often without ever establishing the diagnosis. Without a definitive diagnosis, physicians often withhold or reduce the doses of the antifungal agent when toxicity develops or the patient improves, permitting progression of disease in those with invasive aspergillosis. The Platelia Aspergillus galactomannan antigenemia assay may assist physicians in making these decisions. With a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 89% in the studies leading to its FDA clearance, physicians still must be aware of the potential for false-positive and false-negative results the test does not replace careful microbiological and clinical evaluation. This report will review the relevant literature and provide guidelines for use of the test in patient management.",2004,14987199,no
NEK2A interacts with MAD1 and possibly functions as a novel integrator of the spindle checkpoint signaling.,"Chromosome segregation in mitosis is orchestrated by protein kinase signaling cascades. A biochemical cascade named spindle checkpoint ensures the spatial and temporal order of chromosome segregation during mitosis. Here we report that spindle checkpoint protein MAD1 interacts with NEK2A, a human orthologue of the Aspergillus nidulans NIMA kinase. MAD1 interacts with NEK2A in vitro and in vivo via a leucine zipper-containing domain located at the C terminus of MAD1. Like MAD1, NEK2A is localized to HeLa cell kinetochore of mitotic cells. Elimination of NEK2A by small interfering RNA does not arrest cells in mitosis but causes aberrant premature chromosome segregation. NEK2A is required for MAD2 but not MAD1, BUB1, and HEC1 to associate with kinetochores. These NEK2A-eliminated or -suppressed cells display a chromosome bridge phenotype with sister chromatid inter-connected. Moreover, loss of NEK2A impairs mitotic checkpoint signaling in response to spindle damage by nocodazole, which affected mitotic escape and led to generation of cells with multiple nuclei. Our data demonstrate that NEK2A is a kinetochore-associated protein kinase essential for faithful chromosome segregation. We hypothesize that NEK2A links MAD2 molecular dynamics to spindle checkpoint signaling.",2004,14978040,no
Purification and characterization of a major cross-reactive allergen from Epicoccum purpurascens.,"Epicoccum purpurascens (formerly nigrum) (EP), is a ubiquitous saprophytic mould found both indoors and outdoors. Several studies have reported sensitization to EP in 5-7% of different populations worldwide. The diagnosis of mould allergy requires a standardized fungal extract that contains all its important allergenic proteins. The crude allergen extract from EP was standardized earlier, however none of its allergens have been purified.A major allergen from spore-mycelia extract of EP was purified using concanavalin A (Con A) Sepharose chromatography, gel filtration and electro-elution. The allergen isolated was characterized for its IgE-binding ability and cross-reactivity with five well-known allergenic fungi by ELISA and immunoblot.A 33.5-kD glycoprotein allergen of EP, Epi p 1, was purified to homogeneity. All the EP allergic patients' sera tested recognized this protein. Periodate modification of Epi p 1 showed partial loss in IgE binding while proteinase K treatment caused complete loss in binding to IgE. Dose-dependent inhibition in binding of rabbit anti Epi p 1 antibodies was obtained with Epi p 1, Aspergillus fumigatus, Alternaria alternata, Curvularia lunata, Cladosporium herbarum and Fusarium solani in ELISA. Rabbit antibodies to all the above five fungi recognized Epi p 1 in immunoblot, confirming that Epi p 1 shares common epitopes with the fungi tested.A major glycoprotein allergen of 33.5 kD was purified from EP which cross-reacts with other fungi. Hence this glycoprotein can be exploited to reduce the panel of allergen extracts used for therapy of mould allergy.",2004,14976389,no
Production of melanin by Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Melanins, or melanin-like compounds, may play a role in the pathogenesis of a number of human fungal infections. This study investigated the production of melanin by the important opportunistic pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Conidia from A. fumigatus were harvested and treated with proteolytic enzymes, denaturant and hot, concentrated acid this yielded dark particles which were similar in size and shape to the original propagules. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy revealed that the conidial-derived particles were stable free radicals consistent with an identification as melanin. Melanin particles were used to immunize BALB/c mice in order to produce a total of five anti-melanin monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The latter mAbs were strongly reactive both with intact conidia and with extracted melanin particles by ELISA and immunofluorescence reactivity. Immunofluorescence labelling with the novel mAbs was used to examine the temporal expression of melanin during in vitro culture of A. fumigatus--melanization was confined to conidial structures and was absent from hyphae. SDS-PAGE L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) substrate analysis confirmed the presence of a laccase-type activity in conidial extracts, but not in hyphae. Melanin-binding mAbs were used to detect the presence of melanized conidia in three patients with nasal aspergilloma, indicating that in vivo melanization may occur during infection.",2004,14970241,no
The diagnosis of pneumonia in renal transplant recipients using invasive and noninvasive procedures.,"We used invasive and noninvasive procedures to determine the causes of pneumonia in renal transplant recipients.We retrospectively surveyed 565 renal transplant recipients (transplants received March 1984 to August 2001) to find those with pneumonia. Noninvasive diagnostic methods included serologic testing, and blood and sputum cultures with stains. Invasive procedures included fiberoptic bronchoscopy and percutaneous transthoracic procedures.A total of 92 patients were enrolled. Of these, 71 patients had a definite etiologic diagnosis of pneumonia. The major infectious pathogens were bacterial (n = 21) and mixed bacterial infection (n = 10), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) [n = 18], and fungi (n = 8). Noninvasive and invasive procedures led to the diagnosis of pneumonia in 31.5% (n = 29) and 45.6% (n = 42) of patients, respectively. Bronchoscopy was used in 64 patients, with a diagnostic yield of 38 cases (59.3%). Patients were 3.62 times more likely to contract pneumonia within 12 months of renal transplantation than they were > or =12 months thereafter (95% confidence interval, 1.33 to 9.84). Twenty-seven of the 92 patients (29.3%) died. The pneumonia mortality rate has dropped significantly since 1996 (41.8% vs 10.8%, p = 0.002).Both invasive and noninvasive procedures are useful in the diagnosis of pneumonia, with declining mortality, in renal transplant recipients. Bacterial and mixed bacterial infection, TB, and fungal infection are the most common pathogens cases are most likely to occur within 1 year after renal transplantation.",2004,14769736,no
Development of a serum-based Taqman real-time PCR assay for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.,"We compared an Aspergillus fumigatus-specific Taqman real-time PCR assay for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Platelia Aspergillus method. Patients with proven or probable IA had positive results with at least one of the two methods. The PCR method seems to be more specific, and a combination of the two should improve the diagnosis of IA.",2004,14766869,no
IgE antibody to Aspergillus fumigatus recombinant allergens in cystic fibrosis patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by a heightened Th2 CD4+ T-cell response to Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) allergens and a hyper-immunoglobulin E (IgE) state compared with cystic fibrosis patients without ABPA. The IgE serologic differentiation of ABPA from atopic CF patients can be difficult. We propose as the reactivity with purified antigens varies qualitatively and quantitatively and that the antibody response is more specific than with crude Af antigen extract, the IgE responses to purified recombinant Af allergens may differentiate ABPA from atopic CF patients.Serum IgE reactivity to seven recombinant purified allergens and to a crude extract of Af was measured in 15 ABPA, in 23 Af skin test positive (ST+), and in 19 Af skin test negative (ST-) CF patients. Four of the ABPA CF patients were studied before and after developing ABPA. Nine ABPA patients were studied during flares and remissions of ABPA.Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis patients had significantly increased IgE reactivity to Asp f2, f3, f4, f6, and f16 compared with the Af ST+ and ST- non-ABPA CF patients. In the ABPA patients studied before and after developing ABPA, IgE reactivity also increased to Asp f2, f3, f4, and f6, and to the crude extract. In ABPA CF patients, IgE reactivity to Asp f1, f2, f3, and f6 significantly increased during periods of ABPA flares compared with periods of remission. Analysis of the receiver operating curve demonstrated that IgE reactivity to Asp f3 and f4 gave the best sensitivity and specificity and were better than IgE reactivity to a crude extract of Aspergillus. Furthermore, in ABPA patients studied during periods of remission the IgE reactivity to Asp f3 and f4 remained significantly elevated compared with Af ST+ non-ABPA patients. The IgE responses when considered either to be positive or negative to Asp f3 and f4 significantly differentiated ABPA from Af ST+ and ST- non-ABPA CF patients. In contrast, IgE reactivity was considered positive to the crude extract in 89% of ABPA, 61% of Af ST+, and 0% of Af ST- non-ABPA CF patients.Immunoglobulin E reactivity to a panel of purified Af allergens, especially to Asp f3 and f4, differentiates ABPA from atopic Af ST+ non-ABPA CF patients. Serial determinations of IgE reactivity to individual purified Aspergillus antigens, especially Asp f3, demonstrates that increases in IgE reactivity may provide improved distinction between stages of flares and remission compared with changes in IgE reactivity to a crude Aspergillus extract.",2004,14763934,no
Bifidobacterium lipoteichoic acid and false ELISA reactivity in aspergillus antigen detection.,"A major difficulty with the detection of circulating galactomannan, a cell-wall polysaccharide released by Aspergillus sp during growth, in the serodiagnosis of invasive aspergillosis is the occurrence of false-positive ELISA results, especially in neonates and infants. On the basis of molecule similarity, we postulate that a lipoteichoic acid of Bifidobacterium sp can act as epitope for the monoclonal antibody used in the ELISA. The neonatal gut is heavily colonised with Bifidobacterium sp and these bacteria or their lipoteichoic acid might cause ELISA reactivity with serum after translocation because of immaturity of the intestinal mucosa. If our hypothesis is correct, we might find a method to discriminate between false-positive and true-positive ELISA results and thereby prevent unnecessary pre-emptive treatment of patients.",2004,14751710,no
A new era of antifungal therapy.,"Invasive fungal infections pose major management problems for clinicians caring for hematopoietic cell transplant patients. Two major fungal genera, Candida and Aspergillus, account for most fungal infections. Rates of systemic Candida infection range from 15% to 25%, mostly in the pre-engraftment period. Prophylaxis by fluconazole has dramatically reduced the frequency of early Candida infections. Caspofungin has recently been shown to offer an excellent alternative to amphotericin B (with less toxicity) or fluconazole (with a broader spectrum) for therapy of systemic Candida infections. Aspergillus infections occur in 15% to 20% of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant patients, most frequently in the post-engraftment period they are associated with a severe diminution of cell-mediated immune responses by graft-versus-host disease and prolonged corticosteroid use. Voriconazole, a recently introduced broad-spectrum azole, has excellent activity against Aspergillus and is generally well tolerated. Voriconazole currently offers the best prospect for success and tolerance as a first-line treatment for aspergillosis. Second-line therapies include lipid formulations of amphotericin B, caspofungin, or intravenous itraconazole. Unfortunately, early initiation of therapy for aspergillosis is frequently not possible because of inaccurate diagnostics. One new diagnostic, the galactomannan assay, has recently been approved, and others are in development",2004,14750074,no
Detection of Aspergillus fumigatus mycotoxins: immunogen synthesis and immunoassay development.,"Immunological detection of secreted low molecular weight toxins represents a potentially novel means of diagnosing infection by the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. Two such metabolites, gliotoxin and helvolic acid, were selected and conjugated to thyroglobulin for antisera generation in rabbits. Gliotoxin was initially activated using N-[p-maleimidophenyl] isocyanate (PMPI) and subsequently conjugated to S-acetyl thioglycolic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated thyroglobulin, whereas helvolic acid was activated with N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) in the presence of thyroglobulin prior to immunisation. To facilitate subsequent antisera evaluation, both toxins were similarly conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA). Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation-Time Of Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed covalent attachment of toxins to BSA in the ratios of 15 and 2.4 mol per mol BSA for gliotoxin and helvolic acid, respectively. Resultant high titer antisera were capable of detecting both BSA-conjugated toxins (inhibitory concentration (IC)(50): 4-5 microg/ml). Free toxins were also detectable by competitive immunoassay, whereby 10 microg/ml free gliotoxin (30 microM) and helvolic acid (17 microM), respectively, inhibited antibody binding to cognate toxin-BSA previously immobilised on microwells. This work confirms that sensitive and specific antisera can be raised against fungal toxins and may have an application in diagnosing fungal infection.",2004,14744451,no
Evaluation of molecular and immunological techniques for the diagnosis of mammary aspergillosis in ewes.,"Three techniques for the diagnosis of mammary aspergillosis in ewes were compared: indirect ELISA to detect the level of anti-Aspergillus IgG in serum, determination of galactomannan (Platelia procedure), and detection of DNA of Aspergillus in serum by a nested PCR. Twenty sera from proven cases of aspergillosis in ewes were positive using ELISA (100%), 80% were positive using PCR, but only 55% were positive using Platelia. All 20 control sera were negative using ELISA and PCR, whereas using Platelia methodology one was positive and the other doubtful. The detection of antibody by ELISA in sera is therefore a reliable criterion for the diagnosis of mammary aspergillosis in ewes. Platelia showed the same deficiencies reported in humans, with the appearance of false positives and negatives. The use of PCR was promising and might have valuable application in human medicine.",2004,14738777,no
"The transcription factor HACA mediates the unfolded protein response in Aspergillus niger, and up-regulates its own transcription.","The unfolded protein response (UPR) involves a complex signalling pathway in which the transcription factor HACA plays a central role. Here we report the cloning and characterisation of the hacA gene and its product from Aspergillus niger. ER (endoplasmic reticulum) stress results in the splicing of an unconventional 20-nt intron from the A. niger hacA mRNA, and is associated with truncation of the 5'-end of the hacA mRNA by 230 nt. In this study the UPR was triggered by over expressing tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), and by treatment of mycelia with dithiothreitol (DTT) or tunicamycin. Overexpression of the processed form of hacA not only led to the up-regulation of bipA, cypB and pdiA--mimicking the UPR--but also led to the up-regulation of the hacA gene itself. In vitro binding assays confirmed that the HACA protein binds to the promoters of genes encoding ER-localised chaperones and foldases, and to the promoter of the hacA gene itself. Finally, a GFP-HACA fusion was shown to localise in the nucleus.",2004,14730445,no
"Subcellular localization of aflatoxin biosynthetic enzymes Nor-1, Ver-1, and OmtA in time-dependent fractionated colonies of Aspergillus parasiticus.","The biosynthesis of aflatoxin in Aspergillus parasiticus is a complex process that involves the activities of at least 18 pathway enzymes. The distribution of these enzymes within fungal colonies and fungal cells is not clearly understood. The objective of this study was to investigate the distribution and subcellular location of Nor-1, Ver-1, and OmtA, which represent early, middle, and late enzymatic activities, respectively, in the aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway. The distribution of these three enzymes within A. parasiticus SU-1 was analyzed in time-fractionated, 72-h fungal colonies (fraction 1, 48-72 h fraction 2, 24-48 h",2004,14722624,no
Efficacy of galactomannan antigen in the Platelia Aspergillus enzyme immunoassay for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in liver transplant recipients.,"The utility of galactomannan antigen for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis was evaluated in 154 liver transplant recipients. Sample agreement was 98.5%, and patient specificity was 87%. Galactomannan positivity correlated with mortality, even when controlled for the number of tests performed. Whether galactomannan positivity identifies a subgroup at risk for poor outcome warrants further evaluation.",2004,14715799,no
Airway glycoprotein secretion parallels production and predicts airway obstruction in pulmonary allergy.,"Airway obstruction, perhaps the most relevant clinical feature of asthma, is typically assessed in allergic asthma models as airway hyperresponsiveness. Excess secretion of airway glycoproteins also contributes to airway obstruction in asthma but is not measured as part of most experimental models.The purposes of this study were to develop a reliable, quantitative assay for detecting secreted airway glycoproteins and to assess the secretion of airway glycoproteins in comparison with other markers of airway obstruction resulting from allergic lung inflammation.Two microtiter plate-based glycoprotein-detecting methods were developed, one using an antiglycoprotein antibody and the other using the glycoprotein-binding plant lectin, jacalin. Both methods were used to assess airway glycoprotein secretion in response to 2 defined agonists given intranasally, IL-13 and an allergen derived from Aspergillus fumigatus. Glycoprotein secretion was assessed concomitant with another measure of airway obstruction, airway hyperresponsiveness provoked by acetylcholine challenge, and a histologic method for quantitating glycoprotein production.Both assays were sufficient for quantitating airway glycoproteins over the full range of values encountered from murine bronchoalveolar lavage and yielded highly reproducible data. Secretion of airway glycoproteins increased commensurate with the detection of both airway hyperresponsiveness and airway glycoprotein production induced by IL-13 and allergen.Airway glycoprotein secretion is a consistent feature of the allergic lung phenotype and likely contributes to airway obstruction induced by allergen in both humans and rodents.",2004,14713910,no
Molecular diagnosis of cerebral aspergillosis by sequence analysis with panfungal polymerase chain reaction.,"The authors describe a patient with osteosarcoma in whom a brain abscess developed after autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation. Serologic markers of fungal infection were negative, but fungal DNA was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by panfungal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay using primers derived from fungal 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. The sequence of PCR products on the panfungal assay was identical to the 18S rRNA genes of Aspergillus species. The combination of sequence analysis and panfungal PCR assay could be useful in the diagnosis of cerebral aspergillosis.",2004,14707712,no
Increased sensitivity to IL-4 in cystic fibrosis patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is characterized by a heightened Th2 CD4+ T-cell response to Aspergillus fumigatus allergens and a hyper-immunoglobulin (Ig)E state compared with cystic fibrosis patients without ABPA. We hypothesize that one reason for this response is increased sensitivity to interleukin (IL)-4 in ABPA resulting in increased expression of CD23 and CD86 and leading to a positive amplification mechanism that increases Th2 CD4+ T cell responses.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from seven ABPA CF and 19 non-ABPA CF patients and 16 nonatopic controls and stimulated with rIL-4 (range 0.1-10 ng/ml) and rIL-13 (range 1-10 ng/ml) for 48 h. The number of CD23 molecules and percentages of CD23+ B cells were quantified by flow cytometry. Both phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/ionomycin (IO) and antigen stimulated, toxoid and Asp f2/f3/f4, PBMC were examined for cytoplasmic cytokine synthesis enumerated by cytokine staining using flow cytometry to measure Th2 and Th1 CD3+ T cells.The numbers of CD23 molecules on B-cells were significantly elevated at time 0 in ABPA CF patients compared with both non-ABPA CF patients and nonatopic controls. Following IL-4 stimulation in vitro, the numbers and percentages of CD23 expression on B cells were significantly up-regulated in ABPA CF patients compared with non-ABPA CF patients and controls. The IL-13 stimulation up-regulated CD23 expression however, there was no significant difference in ABPA CF patients compared with non-ABPA CF patients and controls. The percentages of interferon (IFN)-gamma+ CD3+T cells following PMA/IO stimulation were significantly decreased in both ABPA and non-ABPA CF patients compared with controls. There were no significant differences of IL-4+ and IL-13+ CD3+ T cells between ABPA and non-ABPA CF patients. When tetanus toxoid stimulated T cells were examined, both ABPA and non-ABPA CF patients had significantly decreased IFN-gamma+ CD3+ T cells compared with controls. In Asp f2/f3/f4 stimulated T cells, ABPA CF patients had significantly increased IL-4+ CD3+ T cells compared with non-ABPA CF patients and controls.ABPA CF patients have increased sensitivity to IL-4 but not to IL-13 up-regulation of CD23 molecules compared with non-ABPA CF patients. There were decreased percentages of IFN-gamma+ and IL-2+ Th1 T cells in CF patients compared with nonatopic controls but similar percentages of IL-4+ Th2 T cells in all three groups. However, ABPA CF patients had increased frequency of Aspergillus-stimulated Th2 T cells. This indicated that there is skewing of Th2 T cells in ABPA CF patients. Thus, in CF ABPA patients there is increased Th2 T cells and increased sensitivity to IL-4.",2003,14674938,no
Rapid improvement of disseminated aspergillosis with caspofungin/voriconazole combination in an adult leukemic patient.,"A 57-year-old man with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) French-American-British (FAB) 4 developed disseminated invasive cerebral and pulmonary aspergillosis during postinduction aplasia.

Limitations of monoclonal antibodies for monitoring of fungal aerosols using Penicillium brevicompactum as a model fungus.,"Molds are ubiquitous in every environment and many species have been recently associated with an increase in opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients or the exacerbation of asthmatic episodes in allergic patients. The degree of environmental contamination with fungi thus needs to be monitored and in this study we report the development of a monoclonal antibody (mAb)-mediated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of spores of Penicillium brevicompactum in experimental model aerosols. In addition, we have investigated the influence of different parameters of air sampling and sample recovery on ELISA performance. MAbs were produced with standard hybridoma techniques and cross-reactivities were determined against spores of 53 fungal species by indirect ELISA. Standardized experimental fungal aerosols were collected with the Button Personal Inhalable Aerosol Sampler onto polycarbonate or polytetrafluoroethylene filters (PTFE) and the effects of different extraction buffers and filter agitation methods during sample processing on spore recovery and ELISA detection were investigated. Five mAbs were produced and all of them cross-reacted with several of 31 related Aspergillus, Penicillium and Eurotium species. However, cross-reactivities with 21 non-related fungi were rare. Spores were recovered in much higher numbers from polycarbonate filters (PFs) than from polytetrafluoroethylene filters. Optical densities (ODs) in ELISA were higher for spores collected into carbonate coating buffer (CCB) than phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Filter bath sonication following filter vortexing had no positive effects on ELISA sensitivity. The cross-reactivity patterns of mAbs suggest that Aspergillus and Penicillium species share multiple antigens. Quantitative ELISA results for fungal aerosols were found to be influenced by differential sample processing and thus method standardization will be essential to maintain the comparability of immunometric monitoring results.",2003,14659915,no

Ethmoid sinus was the commonest sinus to be affected. Aspergillus serology was positive in 35% and fungal culture grew the organism in 40%.

Mold-specific immunoglobulin G antibodies in a child population.,"The determination of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to molds has been used as an objective evidence of significant mold exposure. Until present, no data have been published on antibody responses to molds in healthy children living in normal housing conditions. The microbe-specific IgG antibody concentrations of 21 molds and 3 actinobacteria were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 103 1- to 6-year-old children (12.4% of the population of that age), and in 111 7- to 14-year-old school children (12.1%). The international standard sera were available, and the IgG concentrations of the test sera could be expressed in mg/l. On average, IgG concentrations increased in relation to age until the age of 6-7 years. At school age the increase still continued but more slowly. Actinobacteria were the only exceptions all three tested strains Sreptomyces albus, S. griseus and S. halstedii resulted in rather high concentrations until 3 years of age. If the children lived in a farm, mold-specific IgG concentrations increased at an earlier age than in other children. The results between farmers' children and other children differed significantly before school age for 20 of the 24 microbes tested, the four exceptions being the 3 actinobacteria and the mold Aspergillus versicolor. The reference values must be age related, and separate references are needed for farmers' children before school age.",2003,14641607,no
Peracetic acid-ethanol treatment of allogeneic avital bone tissue transplants--a reliable sterilization method.,"Based on the European Standard EN 1040, the validation guidelines of the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices and CPMP guidelines we tested the antimicrobial effectiveness of a peracetic acid-ethanol sterilization procedure (PES) in allogenic avital bone transplants.Delipidated human bone spongiosa cubes (15 x 15 x 15 mm) served as tissue. Three enveloped viruses (human immunodeficiency virus type 2, pseudorabies virus, bovine virus diarrhoea virus) and three non-enveloped viruses (hepatitis A virus, poliovirus, porcine parvovirus) were used. The reduction of virus infectivity was measured as TCID50/ml in neutralized supernatants and bone homogenates. Staphylococcus aureus. Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bacillus subtilis. Clostridium sporogenes, Mycobacterium terrae. Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger as well as spores of Bacillus subtilis were tested additionally. PES led to a reduction of virus titres by more than 4 log10. Only HAV showed a reduction below 4 log10 (2.87) with residual infectivity. After including a delipidating step for HAV-infected cells, a reduction of over 7 log10 HAV titre was found. For viable bacteria, fungi and spores a titre reduction below the detection level (5 log10) was achieved after an incubation time of 2 hours.The peracetic acid-ethanol procedure proved to be a reliable method for the sterilization of human bone transplants (layer thickness < or = 15 mm). However, additional safety measures (anamnestic informations, infectious serology, HIV-/HBV-/HCV-PCR in case of multiorgan donors) should be taken.",2003,14626574,no
Impact of diagnostic markers on early antifungal therapy.,"The early treatment of invasive fungal infection is critical but is hampered by the non-specific nature of clinical and radiological signs and the insensitivity of current laboratory diagnostic methods. If mortality due to invasive fungal infection is to be reduced, new, preemptive therapeutic strategies, targeting those patients at highest risk, are required and these will depend on the development of rapid, sensitive diagnostic methods. Such methods have become available in the form of high-resolution computed tomography scanning and serological and molecular techniques and in this review the authors describe recent studies assessing the utility of these methods and consider their role in management strategies.Sensitive assays for the detection of fungal DNA and antigens such as galactomannan and glucan have been prospectively evaluated in the clinical setting and enable identification of patients at an earlier stage of infection. However, the sensitivity and specificity of the assays vary considerably in different studies, depending on several factors including patient selection and clinical application of the test, and issues regarding the release and circulation of galactomannan and fungal DNA remain to be clarified.Rapid serological and molecular diagnostic methods facilitate the early diagnosis of invasive fungal infection and would appear to be most useful when used prospectively to screen high-risk patients. However, in order to determine the optimal approach to treatment it is essential that these tests are incorporated into management strategies and their impact on incidence of invasive fungal infection and clinical outcome evaluated in further clinical trials.",2003,14624100,no
[A comparison of high resolution computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis].,"Apart from serologic markers structural changes of bronchi and adjacent lung tissue are key factors determining the diagnosis and course of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). Due to problems relating to procedural hazards and radiation exposure using bronchography and computerized tomography we evaluated the efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging of the lung in ABPA. Direct comparison of high resolution computerized tomography (HR-CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MR) in 5 patients with ABPA revealed that image resolution and data acquisition of present MR technique are insufficient to accurately delineate the extent and activity of structural damage of bronchi and adjacent lung tissue. Although major bronchiectasis may be identified, MR was unable to demonstrate even extensive patchy infiltrates seen in high resolution computerized tomography. At present, magnetic resonance imaging cannot be recommended for determining diagnosis or course of ABPA.",2003,14618508,no
Detection of IgE reactivity to fungus antigens by immunoblotting in allergic diseases in children.,"Fungi are well-known as sources for allergens that cause allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of sensitization to airborne fungi in allergic diseases in children.The presence of IgE antibodies to common allergens in serum samples from 77 atopic and 5 non-atopic children was determined by multiple allergosorbent (MAST) chemiluminescent assay. The allergic extracts, Penicillium notatum, Penicillium oxalicum, and Aspergillus fumigatus, were prepared. IgE-binding fungal components were identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)-immunoblotting, using sera from the above-mentioned patients.The MAST data demonstrated that 62 (81%) of the 77 sera tested showed IgE antibodies to both Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farinae. Only 2 and 1 of the 77 atopic sera were positive to Penicillium and Aspergillus, respectively. However, 13 (17%) sera showed positive IgE-immunoblotting. Eight and 6 of them demonstrated IgE antibodies to more than 10 different components of P. notatum and P. oxalicum respectively. Ten of the 13 sera showed IgE-immunoblot reactivity to A. fumigatus, and only 1 of the 10 positive samples showed a positive MAST of class I to Aspergillus. All the other sera showed negative results in the MAST test to Aspergillus. The discrepancy observed between the results of IgE-immunoblotting using self-prepared extracts and the commercial MAST test of the serum samples tested may be due to the variations in the fungal strains and the allergenic extracts used, and the different assay systems employed.The results confirmed the importance of airborne fungi in association with allergic disorders in children.",2003,14604308,no

It is important to identify and characterize probable potential virulent factors playing a major role in the pathogenesis of aspergillosis.Using protein purification techniques (lectin affinity chromatography, gel filtration, electroelution and high-pressure liquid chromatography), a major antigen/allergen with a molecular weight of 56 kD (gp56) from A. fumigatus was purified to homogeneity. The protein was characterized by immunoblot, ELISA and protease assays. The N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed.The gp56 protein showed a single band on silver staining and isoelectric focussing. The protein to carbohydrate ratio was 1.5:1 and gp56 gave a protein band at a molecular weight of 34 kD on enzymatic deglycosylation. It also exhibited IgG and IgE immunobinding with antibodies present in sera of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis patients. The gp56 exhibited protease activity and N-terminal seven-amino acid sequence showed homology with fungal serine proteases.The gp56 protein by virtue of its proteolytic activity could be one of the virulent factors of A. fumigatus involved in establishing infection in the host along with other factors.",2003,14600424,no
Mould specific IgG antibodies connected with sinusitis in teachers of mould damaged school: a two-year follow-up study.,"The aim of this study was to describe the relationship between mould exposure induced by moisture damage and mould specific immunoglobulin G antibodies to 20 common mould species and their association with respiratory diseases.Mould specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were monitored in teachers in a follow-up after an extensive mould remediation process in school buildings. IgG antibodies to 20 different microbes were determined from the sera of 26 teachers (19 exposed and 7 references) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The serum samples were drawn twice, firstly at the completion of the remediation in the spring of 1997 and secondly, two years later in the spring of 1999. Health data was collected with self-administered questionnaires.No statistical differences were found in the overall concentrations of 20 mould-specific IgG-antibodies between the study and control groups at the beginning of the study. An association between sinusitis and elevated mould-specific IgG-levels forAspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus versicolor, Aureobasidium pullulans, Chaetomium globosum, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Phialophora bubakii, Rhodotorula glutinis, Sporobolomyces salmonicolor, Stachybotrys atra, and Tritirachium roseum was found in the study group.In a two-year follow-up the total concentration of the IgG antibodies for Tr. toseum was lower at the end than at the beginning of the follow-up and this remained significant for the group of teachers with sinusitis. The decrease in mould specific IgG to Cl. cladosporioides, Geotrichum candidum, Ph. bubakii and Rhizopus nigricans was associated with bronchitis. According to our knowledge, this is the first study in which the association between elevated mould specific IgG antibodies and sinusitis was found in the school environment.",2003,14587535,no
Surfactant protein D in serum from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"Surfactant protein D (SP-D) interacts with Aspergillus fumigatus and is strongly increased in the lavage from animals with acute allergic reactions to the fungus, suggesting a central role for SP-D. As the course of cystic fibrosis (CF) is often complicated by an allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), the authors hypothesised that SP-D may also be increased in serum during an ABPA, potentially assisting in its diagnosis and follow-up. In 22 patients with CF (11 with ABPA, 11 matched without ABPA) and 19 control patients without a pulmonary disease, SP-D concentrations in serum were assessed by an enzyme immunoassay. Serum SP-D in CF patients (130 +/- 16 ng x mL(-1) (mean +/- SEM)) was significantly higher than in the controls without lung disease (66 +/- 8 ng x mL(-1)). During the whole ABPA-episode, SP-D level did not change significantly, despite large changes of total serum immunoglobulin E. There was a clear negative correlation between SP-D concentration and overall lung function, i.e. forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity. Serum level of surfactant protein D may be of value to follow pulmonary function and lung injury in cystic fibrosis patients. Surfactant protein D serum levels are not helpful for the diagnosis and follow-up of an allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis episode, contrary to what was expected from animal experiments.",2003,14582909,no
"Expression and characterization of Asp fI, an immunodominant allergen/antigen of A. fumigatus in insect cell.","Asp fI is a major allergen/antigen/cytotoxin of Aspergillus fumigatus and exhibits ribonuclease activity. This allergen plays a role in allergic and invasive Aspergillosis and reported as a major cytotoxin with ribonuclease activity. To express the protein in large quantity and to characterize the multifunctional nature of Asp fI, we have generated recombinant baculovirus by introducing the gene in pFastBac HTa expression vector and expressed in insect cell. The baculovirus expression vector system has been used as a versatile system for the efficient expression of proteins with most eukaryotic posttranslational modification. Recombinant Asp fI was expressed as approximately 1% of the total cellular protein in infected Sf9 insect cells. The protein was purified using Ni2+ affinity column chromatography and the yield of purified protein was approximately 10 mg/l g of total cellular protein. Immunoreactivity of the protein was determined by immunoblot analysis using both poly His monoclonal antibody, IgG and IgE antibodies present in the sera of ABPA patients. The protein was glycosylated as revealed by the glycoprotein staining and was observed to retain both ribonuclease and cytotoxic activities. These results suggest that Asp fI expressed in insect cell was post translationally modified and biologically active that can be used as a diagnostic marker for biochemical studies.",2003,14577589,no
Genetically modified soybeans: false-positive detection in fermented natural soybean (tempe).,"Tempe was prepared using mixtures of natural soybean and genetically modified Roundup Ready (RUR) soybean fermented with natural Rhizopus sp. The amount of RUR soybean was quantified using an ELISA plate test. The RUR signal decreased during fermentation. In the control experiments on fermentation of non-RUR soybean, the tempe gave a false-positive RUR signal. The cross-reacting substance was generated only in non-RUR soybean during fermentation by Rhizopus sp., Rhizopus oligosporus, R. oryzae, Mucor rouxii and Aspergillus awamori.",2003,14571970,no
Contribution of the Platelia Candida-specific antibody and antigen tests to early diagnosis of systemic Candida tropicalis infection in neutropenic adults.,"The Platelia Candida-specific antigen and antibody assays (Bio-Rad Laboratories) were used to test serial serum samples from seven neutropenic adult patients with hematological malignancies who had developed systemic Candida tropicalis infections. The diagnosis of candidiasis was based on a positive blood culture (all seven patients) and the isolation of C. tropicalis from a normally sterile site (six patients). All patients received early antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and/or an azole derivative and had successful outcomes. When the combined assays were applied to sera collected at different time points before and after the first positive blood culture, all patients tested positive. In six patients, at least one positive test was obtained with sera collected, on average, 5 days (range, 2 to 10 days) prior to the first positive blood culture, while blood cultures were constantly negative. High and persistent mannanemias were detected in all patients during the neutropenic period. In five patients, an increased antibody response was detected when the patients recovered from aplasia. Controls consisted of 48 serum samples from 12 febrile neutropenic patients with aspergillosis (n = 4), bacteremia (n = 4), or no evidence of infection (n = 4). A low level of mannanemia was detected in only one serum sample, and none showed significant Candida antibody titers. Our data thus confirm the value of the combined detection of mannanemia and antimannan antibodies in individuals at risk of candidemia and suggest that in neutropenic patients, an approach based on the regular monitoring of both markers could contribute to the earlier diagnosis of C. tropicalis systemic infection.",2003,14532181,no
Humoral immune response in aspergillosis: an immunodominant glycoprotein of 35 kDa from Aspergillus flavus.,"A glycoprotein preparation containing 70% carbohydrates and 30% proteins was isolated from the mycelium of two strains of Aspergillus flavus and fractionated by ConA-Sepharose affinity chromatography. An immunodominant 35-kDa antigen was detected in a ConA-bound fraction (B fraction). It contained mannose and galactose in a 1.4:1.0 ratio. This antigen seems to be able to elicit an antibody response in patients with aspergillosis and in rabbits immunized with A. flavus whole cells. The carbohydrate units of the BF fraction appeared to be responsible for the antigenicity, since treatment with periodate removed most of the antibody binding capacity.",2003,14506867,no
Diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy of pulmonary infiltrates in febrile neutropenic patients--guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Working Party (AGIHO) of the German Society of Hematology and Oncology (DGHO).,"Patients with severe neutropenia lasting for more than 10 days, who develop fever and pulmonary infiltrates, are at high risk of treatment failure and infection-related death, under conventional broad-spectrum antibiotics. Early supplementation by a systemic antifungal therapy active against Aspergillus spp. has been shown to markedly improve their clinical outcome. Prognosis is significantly influenced by early identification of lung infiltrates by means of high-resolution thoracic computed tomography. Non-culture based diagnostic procedures using a highly sensitive Sandwich ELISA assay to detect circulating galactomannan, or PCR techniques to amplify circulating fungal DNA, may facilitate the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. CT-directed bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage using standardized procedures are useful in order to identify causative microorganisms such as filamentous fungi or Pneumocystis carinii. The standard antifungal agent in the treatment of these patients, amphotericin B deoxycholate, has been challenged recently by newly developed antifungals such as voriconazole. It seems important to continue antifungal treatment for at least 14 days before first response assessment. Microbial isolates from blood cultures, bronchoalveolar lavage or respiratory secretions must be critically interpreted with respect to their etiological relevance for pulmonary infiltrates, to avoid inadequate antimicrobial treatment modification.",2003,13680172,no
Fungus- and wound-induced accumulation of mRNA containing a class II chitinase of the pathogenesis-related protein 4 (PR-4) family of maize.,"Pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins are plant proteins that are induced in response to pathogen attack. PR proteins are grouped into independent families based on their sequences and properties. The PR-4 family comprises class I and class II chitinases. We have isolated a full-length cDNA encoding a chitinase from maize which shares a high degree of nucleotide and amino acid sequence homology with the class II chitinases of the PR-4 family of PR proteins. Our results indicate that fungal infection, and treatment either with fungal elicitors or with moniliformin, a mycotoxin produced by the fungus Fusarium moniliforme, increase the level of ZmPR4 mRNA. In situ mRNA hybridization analysis in sections obtained from fungus-infected germinating embryos revealed that ZmPR4 mRNA accumulation occurs in those cell types that first establish contact with the pathogen. ZmPR4 mRNA accumulation is also stimulated by treatment with silver nitrate whereas the application of the hormones gibberellic acid or acetylsalicylic acid has no effect. Wounding, or treatment with abscisic acid or methyl jasmonate, results in accumulation of ZmPR4 mRNA in maize leaves. Furthermore, the ZmPR4 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and used to obtain polyclonal antibodies that specifically recognized ZmPR4 in protein extracts from fungus-infected embryos. Accumulation of ZmPR4 mRNA in fungus-infected maize tissues was accompanied by a significant accumulation of the corresponding protein. The possible implications of these findings as part of the general defence response of maize plants against pathogens are discussed.",2003,13677464,no
"cDNA cloning, expression and characterization of an allergenic L3 ribosomal protein of Aspergillus fumigatus.","Aspergillus fumigatus (Afu) is an important fungal pathogen causing allergic and invasive respiratory disorders. A plethora of multi-functional allergens/antigens secreted by Afu have been implicated in pathogenesis. The present study was undertaken to identify and characterize novel Afu allergen/antigen by cDNA library approach. cDNA library of Afu was immunoscreened with pooled sera of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) patients. The cDNA clone, TS1, reacting significantly with specific IgG antibodies, was selected. cDNA was subcloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Sequencing of the cDNA revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 1179 bases coding for a protein with an approximate molecular weight of 44 kDa. Immunoreactivity of the recombinant TS1 protein (rTS1) was evaluated by ELISA and Western blot analysis using pooled sera of ABPA patients. The rTS1 exhibited binding to specific IgG and IgE antibodies present in sera of ABPA patients. The deduced amino acid sequence showed homology to 60S ribosomal protein L3 (RpL3) of Aspergillus nidulans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens. The RpL3 of S. cerevesiae, tcm1, to which TS1 sequence shows significant homology (72% identity), is known to be responsible for conferring resistance against trichodermin (antibiotic, inhibiting protein synthesis). The present study has led to identification, cloning and expression of a 44-kDa novel allergen/antigen of Afu with sequence homology to L3 ribosomal protein with a probable role in resistance of Afu to antifungal drugs. Sixty-four per cent sequence identity of Afu RpL3 with human RpL3 and common regions in their predicted epitopes suggest a possibility of involvement of Afu RpL3 in autoimmune reactions due to molecular mimicry.",2003,12974759,no
"Mild, moderate, and severe forms of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis: a clinical and serologic evaluation.","Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a hypersensitivity disorder induced by Aspergillus species colonizing the bronchial tree. There are patients with asthma who fulfill the diagnostic criteria of ABPA by serologic evaluation (specific IgE/IgG to Aspergillus fumigatus), bronchography, CT, and or conventional linear tomography.To identify different forms of ABPA based on various diagnostic criteria.Eighteen patients with asthma fulfilling the criteria of ABPA were evaluated in the present study. Six patients each received a diagnosis of ABPA serologic positive (ABPA-S), ABPA with central bronchiectasis (ABPA-CB), and ABPA with central bronchiectasis and other radiologic features (ABPA-CB-ORF).The spirometric changes in the ABPA-S group (group 1) were mild, in the ABPA-CB group (group 2) were moderate, and in the ABPA-CB-ORF group (group 3) were severe. Absolute eosinophil count was raised in each group but was maximum (1,233 micro L) in severe form of disease (group 3). Specific IgE against A fumigatus was raised in each group, and the maximum was 47.91 IU/mL in ABPA-CB-ORF. CT scan findings of the ABPA-S group were normal without central bronchiectasis. The exacerbation in symptoms was maximum in group 3 compared to other groups.The present observations suggest that ABPA includes mild (ABPA-S), moderate (ABPA-CB), and severe (ABPA-CB-ORF) forms of disease. It is recommended, therefore, that the disease should be diagnosed early, treated at the mild form of disease (ABPA-S), and prevented from leading to ABPA-CB or ABPA-CB-ORF.",2003,12970013,no
Competitive binding inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that uses the secreted aspartyl proteinase of Candida albicans as an antigenic marker for diagnosis of disseminated candidiasis.,"The secreted aspartyl proteinases (Saps) of Candida albicans have been implicated as virulence factors associated with adherence and tissue invasion. The potential use of proteinases as markers of invasive candidiasis led us to develop a competitive binding inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect Sap in clinical specimens. Daily serum and urine specimens were collected from rabbits that had been immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide and cortisone acetate and infected intravenously with 10(7) C. albicans blastoconidia. Disseminated infection was confirmed by organ culture and histopathology. Although ELISA inhibition was observed when serum specimens from these rabbits were used, more significant inhibition, which correlated with disease progression, occurred when urine specimens were used. Urine collected as early as 1 day after infection resulted in significant ELISA inhibition (mean inhibition +/- standard error [SE] compared with preinfection control urine, 15.7% +/- 2.7% [P < 0.01]), and inhibition increased on days 2 through 5 (29.4% +/- 4.8% to 44.5% +/- 3.5% [P < 0.001]). Urine specimens from immunosuppressed rabbits infected intravenously with Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, or Staphylococcus aureus were negative in the assay despite culture-proven dissemination. Nonimmunosuppressed rabbits receiving oral tetracycline and gentamicin treatment were given 2 x 10(8) C. albicans blastoconidia orally or intraurethrally to establish colonization of the gastrointestinal tract or bladder, respectively, without systemic dissemination urine specimens from these rabbits also gave negative ELISA results. Dissemination to the kidney and spleen occurred in one rabbit challenged by intragastric inoculation, and urine from this rabbit demonstrated significant inhibition in the ELISA (mean inhibition +/- SE by day 3 after infection, 32.9% +/- 2.7% [P < 0.001]). The overall test sensitivity was 83%, the specificity was 92%, the positive predictive value was 84%, the negative predictive value was 91%, and the efficiency was 89% (166 urine samples from 33 rabbits tested). The specificity, positive predictive value, and efficiency could be increased to 97, 95, and 92%, respectively, if at least two positive test results were required for a true positive designation. The ELISA was sensitive and specific for the detection of Sap in urine specimens from rabbits with disseminated C. albicans infection, discriminated between colonization and invasive disease, reflected disease progression and severity, and has the potential to be a noninvasive means to diagnose disseminated candidiasis.",2003,12965914,no
The enhancing rim: a new sign of a benign pulmonary nodule.,"To describe a new radiological sign, the enhancing rim sign, that indicates that a solitary pulmonary nodule is benign rather than malignant.Sixteen adult patients underwent computed tomographic (CT) evaluation with intravenous contrast enhancement of an indeterminate solitary pulmonary nodule between May 25, 2000, and March 21, 2002, at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz. In each patient, we identified a rim of enhancing soft tissue at the periphery of a solitary pulmonary nodule this rim surrounds a homogeneous, lower-density central portion of the nodule. Surgical or biopsy specimens from 6 patients and clinical data from 10 patients were evaluated to determine whether the nodules with the enhancing rims were benign or malignant.Pulmonary nodules in 6 patients were diagnosed as benign after histological evaluations of tissue obtained by surgical resection (3 patients), bronchoscopic biopsy (1 patient), and CT-guided needle biopsy (3 patients) (1 patient had a needle biopsy and wedge resection). In another 10 patients, pulmonary nodules were diagnosed as benign during clinical follow-up (range, 2-24 months median, 11 months): in 1 patient, the nodule disappearedThe enhancing rim sign, seen on chest CT with intravenous contrast enhancement of a solitary pulmonary nodule, has been useful to distinguish some benign pulmonary nodules from malignant pulmonary nodules.",2003,12962164,no
Immunodiagnosis of ABPA.,"For the diagnosis of allergic aspergillosis demonstration of specific immune responses to allergens has been accepted as a significant paradigm. Elevated levels of total IgE and Aspergillus fumigatus specific IgE and IgG antibodies are important criteria for diagnosis of ABPA. Although reference antigens or standardized methods are not available, there are a number of relevant recombinant antigens, which have been isolated in recent years. Several techniques have been employed in the demonstration of specific antibodies against antigens of Aspergillus fumigatus in the sera of patients. Of these methods, the widely followed ones are ELISA, radioimmunoassay, Western blot, and agar gel double diffusion. Recently, semi-automated methods have been developed using recombinant allergens to detect circulating antibody against Aspergillus. However, these methods have not been evaluated widely. Here we review the immunodiagnostic methods currently in use for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.",2003,12957831,no
[Invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients].,"To analyse results of treatment of invasive aspergillesis in immunocompromised patients for 2000-2002.The study was made of patients who, when treated with antibiotics, exhibited foci in the lungs typical for invasive aspergillesis. Aspergillas were detected in the sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial wash-ups, aspergilla antigen (galactomannan) was detected in the blood.Invasive aspergillesis was diagnosed in 25 patients. 13 (52%) patients were treated with adjuvant glucocorticoids. 19 (76%) patients had neutropenia. All the patients had fever. Foci in the lungs were in 24 patients. Aspergillas were detected in 15 patients, a positive antigen galactomannan in 7 patients. A. Fumigatus, A flavus, A. Niger occurred in 67, 26.5 and 6.5% patients, respectively. All the patients received amphotericin B (median of the treatment reached 38 days, total dose 880-3500 mg). In 5 patients amphotericin B was replaced for liposomal amphotericin B because of high creatinine. 7 patients continued with itraconasol in a dose 400-600 mg/day. The foci were removed in 3 patients. The cure was achieved in 12 patients, 13 patients, 13 patients died (cause of death--respiratory insufficiency).Lethality in invasive aspergillesis in immunocompromised patients remains high--52%. Cultural detection of mycelial fungi was, as a rule, delayed. Early diagnosis of the disease requires monitoring of the aspergilla antigen in the blood and computer tomography of the chest especially in fever persisting in the treatment of wide-spectrum antibiotics.",2003,12934484,no
Binding of live conidia of Aspergillus fumigatus activates in vitro-generated human Langerhans cells via a lectin of galactomannan specificity.,"Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common aetiological fungus responsible for human pulmonary aspergilloses. This study investigated the primary contact between Langerhans cells (LC), corresponding to dendritic cells present in pulmonary mucosa and live conidia of A. fumigatus. LC play a key role in antigen presentation for initiation of the primary T cell response. In vitro-generated LC (iLC) were differentiated from cultured human cord blood CD34+ cells and incubated at 4 degrees C or 37 degrees C with fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC)-stained conidia or control latex beads. In vitro, conidia were shown by microscopy and cytometry to adhere to iLC in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This adhesion was not limited to iLC because interstitial dendritic and other cells also fluoresced in the presence of conidia-FITC. A lectin other than mannose receptor-type lectin was demonstrated to be responsible of conidial binding. Inhibition of binding was observed with heterologous galactomannan and EDTA, indicating a C-lectin-like receptor with galactomannan structure specificity. After binding only a few conidia were internalized in acidic vesicles, as indicated by the cessation of conidial fluorescence. Conidial binding was followed by activation and maturation of iLC, suggesting that LC present in the lung may play a role in cellular host defence against aspergilloses.",2003,12930363,no
Serine proteinases with gelatinolytic activity in an Aspergillus fumigatus allergenic extract.,"The presence of proteolytic activity in Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) extract was analyzed in polyacrylamide gelatine containing gels at different pHs. The gelatinolytic pattern showed three major activities (180, 70, and 34 kDa bands) over a broad pH range (pH 4-8). All bands showed maximum activity at pH 8, and the activity declined at lower pH, showing no activity at pH 2. The susceptibility of the proteolytic activity to protease inhibitors confirmed that the fungal extract contained serine proteinases, and one of them, the 34 kDa band, showed a chymotrypsin-like proteinase. The immunochemical fungal extract properties were studied by western blot, and the samples were run in the presence or absence of denaturing and reducing (DTT) conditions. Two protein bands located at approximately 180 and 84 kDa showed immunoreactivity with allergenic patients' anti-Af serum, when the samples were run under denaturing and reducing conditions. In the native form an additional third immunoreactive band of about 70 kDa was found. There were no immunoreactive bands toward IgE about 34 kDa. Periodate treatment caused the decrease or disappearance of the immunoreactivity in the bands, demonstrating that epitopes recognized by serum IgE specific to Af are partially composed by carbohydrates (180 and 70 kDa bands) while others (84 kDa) are carbohydrates. Although further investigations are needed, these preliminary results suggest alkaline serine proteinases from Aspergillus fumigatus as one of the factors responsible for the fungal allergenicity.",2003,12926185,no
Effect of amphotericin B treatment on kinetics of cytokines and parameters of fungal load in neutropenic rats with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.,"The kinetics of various parameters of fungal load and cytokines were investigated, in order to acquire insight into the pathogenesis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) during antifungal treatment with amphotericin B.Neutropenic rats with left-sided IPA received either treatment with amphotericin B or remained untreated. At 0, 4, 8, 16, 24, 48, 72 and 120 h after fungal inoculation, the rats were dissected. The size of the macroscopic pulmonary lesions, the number of cfu and amounts of chitin were determined in the infected left lung. Galactomannan concentrations were measured both in the left lung and serum. The cytokines tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, interferon (IFN)-gamma, IL-4, IL-10, and the chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 were determined quantitatively by ELISA in the infected left lung, uninfected right lung and serum.Amphotericin B treatment of IPA resulted in changed aspect of pulmonary lesions and significantly reduced levels of left lung chitin (72 and 120 h), left lung galactomannan (72 and 120 h) and serum galactomannan (120 h), but not left lung cfu, compared with untreated infected rats. In addition, amphotericin B treatment resulted in a significant decrease in levels of left lung IL-6 (at 72 and 120 h), MIP-2 (at 120 h) and MCP-1 (at 120 h). No local or systemic increases in TNF-alpha, IL-1beta or IFN-gamma were observed during infection.It is concluded that treatment with amphotericin B results in decreased fungal load in the infected lung. This reduction in fungal load probably results in a decreased local inflammatory response, as measured by decreased levels of IL-6, MIP-2 and MCP-1 in the infected lung.",2003,12917249,no
"Hematology, plasma biochemistry, and serosurvey for selected infectious agents in southern giant petrels from Patagonia, Argentina.","In conjunction with reproductive and feeding ecology studies on southern giant petrels (SGP, Macronectes giganteus) blood samples were collected for baseline health evaluations. Twenty-five adult SGP from a breeding colony in Chubut, Argentina, were sampled during two consecutive breeding seasons, 1999-2000 (n = 15) and 2000-01 (n = 10). Values for hematology, plasma biochemistry, and minerals are described for 20 birds in apparent good physical condition. A serologic survey of exposure to selected infectious agents was also conducted on all 25 birds sampled. Southern giant petrels were serologically negative for evidence of exposure to infectious laryngotracheitis virus, avian encephalomyelitis virus, avian influenza virus, avian reovirus, infectious bursal disease virus, infectious bronchitis virus, paramyxovirus 1, 2, and 3 virus, Chlamydophila, and Aspergillus. Antibodies to avian adenovirus were found in 14% of SGP during the first sampling season, and 60% in the second year. Additionally, all birds were negative for antibodies to Salmonella pullorum at the first sampling date, but 90% had low titers the following breeding season. This study contributes to understanding the health status of South Atlantic seabirds and to establishment of baseline information for SGP. Long-term monitoring of pelagic predator-scavenger seabirds such as SGP should be established for the surveillance of marine ecosystem health.",2003,12910764,no

Experimental pulmonary aspergillosis due to Aspergillus terreus: pathogenesis and treatment of an emerging fungal pathogen resistant to amphotericin B.,"Aspergillus terreus is an uncommon but emerging fungal pathogen, which causes lethal infections that are often refractory to amphotericin B (AmB). In comparison to Aspergillus fumigatus, A. terreus was resistant to the in vitro fungicidal effects of safely achievable concentrations of AmB. These in vitro findings correlated directly with resistance of A. terreus to AmB in experimental invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Residual fungal pulmonary burden and galactomannan antigenemia demonstrated persistent infection, despite therapy with deoxycholate AmB or liposomal AmB. By comparison, posaconazole and itraconazole resolved GM antigenemia, reduced residual fungal burden, and improved survival. There were no differences in phagocytic host response to A. terreus versus A. fumigatus however, the rate of conidial germination of A. terreus was slower. The strain of A. terreus with the highest minimum inhibitory and minimum lethal concentration of AmB also had the lowest membrane ergosterol content. The hyphae of A. terreus in vivo displayed distinctive aleurioconidia, which may be a practical microscopic feature for rapid preliminary diagnosis.",2003,12854088,no
"Histone deacetylases in fungi: novel members, new facts.","Acetylation is the most prominent modification on core histones that strongly affects nuclear processes such as DNA replication, DNA repair and transcription. Enzymes responsible for the dynamic equilibrium of histone acetylation are histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). In this paper we describe the identification of novel HDACs from the filamentous fungi Aspergillus nidulans and the maize pathogen Cochliobolus carbonum. Two of the enzymes are homologs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae HOS3, an enzyme that has not been identified outside of the established yeast systems until now. One of these homologs, HosB, showed intrinsic HDAC activity and remarkable resistance against HDAC inhibitors like trichostatin A (TSA) when recombinant expressed in an Escherichia coli host system. Phylo genetic analysis revealed that HosB, together with other fungal HOS3 orthologs, is a member of a separate group within the classical HDACs. Immunological investigations with partially purified HDAC activities of Aspergillus showed that all classical enzymes are part of high molecular weight complexes and that a TSA sensitive class 2 HDAC constitutes the major part of total HDAC activity of the fungus. However, further biochemical analysis also revealed an NAD(+)-dependent activity that could be separated from the other activities by different types of chromatography and obviously represents an enzyme of the sirtuin class.",2003,12853613,no
Beta-galactofuranose-containing O-linked oligosaccharides present in the cell wall peptidogalactomannan of Aspergillus fumigatus contain immunodominant epitopes.,"O-linked oligosaccharide groups ranging from di- to hexasaccharide were beta-eliminated by mild alkaline treatment under reducting conditions from the peptidogalactomannan of Aspergillus fumigatus mycelial cell wall. The resulting reduced oligosaccharides, which were the minor components of the peptidogalactomannan fraction, were fractionated to homogeneity by successive gel filtration and high-performance liquid chromatography. Their primary structures were determined based on a combination of techniques including gas chromatography, ESI-QTOF-MS, 1H COSY and TOCSY, and 1H-13C HMQC NMR spectroscopy and methylation analysis, to be: alpha-Glcp-(1 --> 6)-Man-ol, beta-Galf-(1 --> 6)-alpha-Manp-(1 --> 6)-Man-ol, beta-Galf-(1 --> 5)-beta-Galf-(1 --> 6)-alpha-Manp-(1 --> 6)-Man-ol and beta-Galf-(1 --> 5)-[beta-Galf-(1 --> 5]3-beta-Galf-(1 --> 6)-Man-ol. The beta-Galf containing oligosaccharides have not been previously described as fungal O-linked oligosaccharides. The peptidogalactomannan is antigenic and was recognized by human sera of patients with aspergillosis when probed by ELISA, but de-O-glycosylation rendered a 50% decrease in its reactivity. Furthermore, when tested in a hapten inhibition test, the isolated oligosaccharide alditols were able to block, on a dose-response basis, recognition between human sera and the intact peptidogalactomannan. The immunodominant epitopes were present in the tetra- and hexasaccharide, which contain a beta-Galf-(1 --> 5)-beta-Galf terminal group. These results suggest that the O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharide chains, despite being the less abundant carbohydrate component of the A. fumigatus peptidogalactomannan, may account for a significant part of its antigenicity, other than the known activity associated with the galactomannan component.",2003,12851285,no
Induction mechanism of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in potato tuber and sweet potato root tissues.,"3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR, EC1.1.1.34), the key enzyme in isoprenoid biosynthesis, was purified from microsomes of potato tuber tissue, and a polyclonal antibody and two monoclonal antibodies against the purified enzyme were prepared. HMGR protein content was measured by immunotitration and radioimmunoassay using these antibodies. HMGR activity was very low in the fresh tissues of both potato tuber and sweet potato root. The activity in potato tuber was increased by cutting and further by additional fungal infection of the cut tissues. In sweet potato root tissue, the activity was scarcely increased after cutting alone, but was markedly increased by additional fungal infection or chemical treatment. The HMGR protein contents in both fresh potato tuber and sweet potato root tissues were also very low, and increased markedly in response to cutting and fungal infection. From these results, we proposed a hypothesis on the induction mechanism of HMGR after cutting and fungal infection in potato tuber and sweet potato root tissues.",2003,12834277,no
"Preclinical assessment of the efficacy of mycograb, a human recombinant antibody against fungal HSP90.","Mycograb (NeuTec Pharma plc) is a human genetically recombinant antibody against fungal heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). Antibody to HSP90 is closely associated with recovery in patients with invasive candidiasis who are receiving amphotericin B (AMB). Using in vitro assays developed for efficacy assessment of chemotherapeutic antifungal drugs, Mycograb showed activity against a wide range of yeast species (MICs against Candida albicans [fluconazole [FLC]-sensitive and FLC-resistant strains], Candida krusei, Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata, and Candida parapsilosis, 128 to 256 microg/ml). Mycograb (4 or 8 microg/ml) showed synergy with AMB, the fractional inhibitory index being 0.09 to 0.31. Synergy was not evident with FLC, except for FLC-sensitive C. albicans. Murine kinetics showed that Mycograb at 2 mg/kg produced a maximum concentration of drug in serum of 4.7 microg/ml, a half-life at alpha phase of 3.75 min, a half-life at beta phase of 2.34 h, and an area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to t h of 155 microg. min/ml. Mycograb (2 mg/kg) alone produced significant improvement in murine candidiasis caused by each species: (i). a reduction (Scheffe's test, P < 0.05) in the mean organ colony count for the FLC-resistant strain of C. albicans (kidney, liver, and spleen), C. krusei (liver and spleen), C. glabrata (liver and spleen), C. tropicalis (kidney), and C. parapsilosis (kidney, liver, and spleen) and (ii). a statistically significant increase in the number of negative biopsy specimens (Fisher's exact test, P < 0.05) for C. glabrata (kidney), C. tropicalis (liver and spleen), and C. parapsilosis (liver). AMB (0.6 mg/kg) alone cleared the C. tropicalis infection but failed to clear infections caused by C. albicans, C. krusei, C. glabrata, or C. parapsilosis. Synergy with AMB, defined as an increase (Fisher's exact test, P < 0.05) in the number of negative biopsy specimens compared with those obtained using AMB alone, occurred with the FLC-resistant strain of C. albicans (kidney), C. krusei (spleen), C. glabrata (spleen), and C. parapsilosis (liver and spleen). Only by combining Mycograb with AMB was complete resolution of infection achieved for C. albicans, C. krusei, and C. glabrata.",2003,12821470,no
Combination therapy in treatment of experimental pulmonary aspergillosis: synergistic interaction between an antifungal triazole and an echinocandin.,"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. Simultaneous inhibition of fungal cell-wall and cell-membrane biosynthesis may result in synergistic interaction against Aspergillus fumigatus. We studied the antifungal activity of micafungin, a new echinocandin, in combination with ravuconazole, a second-generation triazole, against experimental invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in persistently neutropenic rabbits. This combination led to significant reductions in mortality (P</=.001), residual fungal burden (P</=.05), and serum galactomannan antigenemia (P</=.01), compared with either agent alone. Combination therapy also resulted in reduction (P</=.05) of organism-mediated pulmonary injury and of pulmonary infiltrates detected by thoracic computed tomography (P</=.001). No toxicity was observed with the echinocandin-triazole combination. An MTT hyphal damage assay demonstrated significant in vitro synergistic interaction between the antifungal triazole and the echinocandin. The combination of an antifungal triazole and echinocandin may represent a new strategy for treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.",2003,12792859,no
Early results of targeted prophylaxis for coccidioidomycosis in patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation within an endemic area.,"Coccidioidomycosis (CM) is an endemic fungal infection of the desert southwestern United States. In immunocompromised hosts, such as transplant recipients, this infection is often a severe, disseminated disease with high mortality. A history of coccidioidal infection or positive serologic results increases the risk of CM after transplantation. At our institution, all liver transplant candidates with either positive history or serologic results for coccidioidal infection receive fluconazole in order to prevent recurrent infection after transplantation. Patients with neither a history of coccidioidal infection nor positive serologic results do not receive prophylaxis but are followed serologically every 3 months. From June 1999 to October 2001, 81 liver transplantations were performed at our institution in 76 patients with end-stage liver disease. Four of these 76 patients received prophylactic fluconazole in order to prevent CM. None of these 4 patients had reactivation of CM. A new coccidioidal infection developed after orthotopic liver transplantation in 1 of 72 patients (1.4%). Close surveillance and targeted prophylaxis are safe and effective alternatives to universal prophylaxis for CM in patients undergoing liver transplantation in an endemic area.",2003,12791068,no
"Induced sputum IL-8 gene expression, neutrophil influx and MMP-9 in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.","Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a hypersensitivity reaction to the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, causing severe asthma that may progress to bronchiectasis. Sputum neutrophilia can occur in association with sputum eosinophilia and correlates with the degree of bronchiectasis. The mechanisms of sputum neutrophilia in ABPA are not known. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the chemokine interleukin (IL)-8 in sputum neutrophilia in ABPA. Induced sputum was obtained from subjects with ABPA (n=29), and compared to nonsensitised asthma (n=9) and healthy controls (n=21). Semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to assess IL-8 gene expression in induced sputum and IL-8 protein was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Sputum IL-8 protein was significantly higher in ABPA compared to asthma and controls. IL-8 messenger ribonucleic acid/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ratio was elevated in ABPA compared to asthma and controls. Sputum IL-8 correlated with sputum neutrophils, matrix metalloproteinase-9 levels and forced expiratory volume in one second. Interleukin-8 gene expression and protein release were increased in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and correlated with airway neutrophilia and airway obstruction. The interleukin-8-mediated neutrophil influx in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis may induce lung damage via release of matrix metalloproteinase-9, potentially leading to bronchiectasis.",2003,12762339,no
Prominent induction of cyclin B1 in G2/M renal cancer cells with butyrolactone 1.,"Butyrolactone 1 (BL) is a cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor derived from Aspergillus terreus. None of the present drugs are effective for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. The use of BL is expected to promote a new type therapy of renal cancer.We investigated three human renal cancer cell lines: ACHN, OS-RC-2 and RCC10RGB, using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and two-color flow cytometry. Simultaneous measurements of DNA content and cyclin expression allowed us to perform cell cycle specific analysis. Western blot analysis was performed using ACHN to represent cell lines.BL inhibited cell proliferation and caused cell accumulation at G2/M phase associated with the emergence of the third peak. Moreover, BL induced cyclin B1 over-expression in G2/M cells. These changes were quite definite, whereas cyclins D1, E and A showed no changes at all. Cyclin B1 accumulation was confirmed by western blot analysis. The chronological observation revealed that the emergence of the third peak preceded the regression of the increased cyclin B1 positive G2/M cells. These results suggested that BL accelerated cyclin B1 accumulation in G2/M cells, which then shifted to G1 phase without cell division. New G1 cells started DNA synthesis most likely as endoreduplication to form the third peak and the mechanism of cyclin B1 accumulation converted into down-regulation.BL induced significant cell kinetic interference in the tested human renal carcinoma cell lines. This might indicate the possibility of a new medical treatment modality for renal cancer.",2003,12757604,no
Cerebral aspergillosis in an infant with corticosteroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome.,Cerebral aspergillosis is a devastating disease in patients with a compromised immune system. A unique case of a male infant with corticosteroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome complicated by pulmonary and cerebral aspergillosis is described. The patient rapidly developed coma and neurological symptoms and died soon thereafter. Central nervous system aspergillosis was diagnosed radiologically and by detection of Aspergillus DNA and antigen (galactomannan) in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Moderate immunosuppressive therapy and antifungal phagocytic dysfunction due to nephrotic syndrome per se may have contributed to the occurrence of invasive aspergillosis in our patient. Awareness of this serious complication and early application of diagnostic procedures and antifungal therapy may improve the dismal outcome.,2003,12736806,no
Detection of circulating Aspergillus fumigatus galactomannan: value and limits of the Platelia test for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis.,"The effectiveness of galactomannan detection with the Platelia test was evaluated in a prospective study of 3,327 sera from 807 patients. The specificity was 99.6% (748 of 751 cases). For the groups of patients with proven and probable invasive aspergillosis, the sensitivity was 50.0% (17 of 34 cases). The disappointing sensitivity associated with the presence of rare false-positive cases underlines the limits of this test.",2003,12734275,yes
In vivo visualization of the distribution of a secretory protein in Aspergillus oryzae hyphae using the RntA-EGFP fusion protein.,"A fusion gene encoding ribonuclease T1-EGFP (rntA-egfp) was constructed and expressed to use it as a tool for studies on the secretory pathway in Aspergillus oryzae. The successful secretion of the intact RntA-EGFP fusion protein was detected by fluorescence measurement and Western analysis. With use of the RntA-EGFP system, we were able to see high fluorescence at hyphal tips and observe concentrated fluorescence at septa in basal cells during growth at optimal conditions. Cold or heat shock during growth caused the accumulation of EGFP fluorescence in vacuoles.",2003,12729022,no
Galactomannan detection in computerized tomography-based broncho-alveolar lavage fluid and serum in haematological patients at risk for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.,"We determined the value of galactomannan (GM) detection in computerized tomography (CT)-based broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and serum for the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in haemato-oncological patients with neutropenia. CT of the thorax and BAL were performed systematically at predefined clinical indications. GM was determined by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay the clinicians were unaware of the results. Of 160 patients, 17 patients (10.6%) presented with proven, probable or suspected IPA. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of GM detection in CT-based BAL fluid were all 100%. For GM detection in serially sampled serum, the sensitivity was 47%, the specificity 93%, the PPV 73% and the NPV 82%. A non-blinded follow-up study was performed to validate these results. In this study, 22 of 198 patients (11.1%) presented with IPA, and the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of GM detection in CT-based BAL fluid were 85%, 100%, 100% and 88% respectively. None of BAL fluids obtained after antifungal treatment of 3 d or more were positive. These results indicate that, when CT is used systematically and at an early stage, GM detection in CT-based BAL fluid has a high PPV for diagnosing IPA early in untreated patients.",2003,12716367,yes
Disseminated mycosis in layer cockerels and pullets.,"Eight-wk-old layer cockerels and pullets were presented to the diagnostic lab with a history of increased mortality, ruffled feathers, lameness, and recent vaccination. At necropsy, the birds had large multifocal granulomas in multiple tissues. Only light bacterial growth was seen on culture. On histopathology, a mixed population of fungi was seen within the granulomas including zygomycetes and Aspergillus, with the zygomycetes being the predominant organism. Because of the coinfection with Aspergillus and Penicillium, obtaining the zygomycetes in pure culture was unsuccessful. The source of the zygomycete fungi remains unknown however, zygomycetes are known to be ubiquitous. Serology was performed to evaluate the flock's immune status. There was no evidence of immunosuppression caused by chicken anemia virus or bursal disease infections. No flock treatment was initiated.",2003,12713184,no
"Identification of catalytic residues of Ca2+-independent 1,2-alpha-D-mannosidase from Aspergillus saitoi by site-directed mutagenesis.","The roles of six conserved active carboxylic acids in the catalytic mechanism of Aspergillus saitoi 1,2-alpha-d-mannosidase were studied by site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic analyses. We estimate that Glu-124 is a catalytic residue based on the drastic decrease of kcat values of the E124Q and E124D mutant enzyme. Glu-124 may work as an acid catalyst, since the pH dependence of its mutants affected the basic limb. D269N and E411Q were catalytically inactive, while D269E and E411D showed considerable activity. This indicated that the negative charges at these points are essential for the enzymatic activity and that none of these residues can be a base catalyst in the normal sense. Km values of E273D, E414D, and E474D mutants were greatly increased to 17-31-fold wild type enzyme, and the kcat values were decreased, suggesting that each of them is a binding site of the substrate. Ca2+, essential for the mammalian and yeast enzymes, is not required for the enzymatic activity of A. saitoi 1,2-alpha-d-mannosidase. EDTA inhibits the Ca2+-free 1,2-alpha-d-mannosidase as a competitive inhibitor, not as a chelator. We deduce that the Glu-124 residue of A. saitoi 1,2-alpha-d-mannosidase is directly involved in the catalytic mechanism as an acid catalyst, whereas no usual catalytic base is directly involved. Ca2+ is not essential for the activity. The catalytic mechanism of 1,2-alpha-d-mannosidase may deviate from that typical glycosyl hydrolase.",2003,12702721,no

"[Asthma, alveolitis, aspergillosis, berylliosis. What to do when there is allergic reaction of the lung?].","Among the major allergic pulmonary disorders are bronchial asthma, extrinsic allergic alveolitis, allergic aspergillosis and berylliosis. Asthma is diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms (wheezing, respiratory distress, tight chest, coughing) and lung function tests possibly supplemented by allergic and provocative testing. Asthma treatment is differentiated into long-term medication and as-required medication. Specific immunotherapy is considered the sole causal therapy. Extrinsic allergic alveolitis is work- or hobby-related (farmer's/cheese worker's/bird-fancier's lung) and manifests as diffuse pneumonitis with dyspnea, coughing and fever. For the diagnosis, the antigen provocative test in particular plays a major role. In the main, treatment comprises strict avoidance of allergens. The diagnosis of allergic pulmonary aspergillosis is based on the history, clinical findings, skin tests, serology and radiography. Treatment is stage-related by means of immunosuppressive agents. In terms of radiographic and pulmonary function findings, berylliosis is similar to sarcoidosis. Here, too, immunosuppressive agents are to the fore.",2003,12688025,no
"Forum report: issues in the evaluation of diagnostic tests, use of historical controls, and merits of the current multicenter collaborative groups.","This forum report contains conclusions about 3 different issues relevant to conducting clinical trials in deep mycoses. (1) Trials of diagnostic tests for deep mycoses must define the population appropriate for testing and the clinical question being asked. The unanswered question for the serum Aspergillus galactomannan assay is whether knowledge of results can change use of empirical therapy to treat febrile patients at high risk of invasive aspergillosis. (2) Use of historical controls is suboptimal but offers a pragmatic solution for studying rare mycoses use of contemporaneous controls, matched for critical variables and evaluated by a blinded data review committee using detailed criteria, appears optimal. (3) Established groups of independent investigators, such as the European Organization for Research on Treatment of Cancer's Invasive Fungal Infections Group and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases's Bacteriology and Mycology Study Group, provide a pool of experienced investigators, defined operating rules, impartiality, and specialized expertise. Considering the enormous investment required for adequately powered efficacy trials of antifungal agents and the importance of these trials to guide clinical practice, use of collaborative groups outweighs the extra administrative time that is sometimes required.",2003,12679896,no
Quantitative trait loci for low aflatoxin production in two related maize populations.,"Aflatoxin B(1) formed by Aspergillus flavus Fr:Link has been associated with animal disease and liver cancer in humans. We performed genetic studies in progenies derived from maize inbred Tex6, associated with relatively low levels of aflatoxin production, crossed with the historically important inbred B73. (Tex6 x B73) x B73 BC(1)S(1) and Tex6 x B73 F(2:3) mapping populations were produced and evaluated in 1996 and 1997 in Champaign, Ill. Ears were inoculated 20 to 24 days after midsilk using a pinboard method and a mixture of conidia of A. flavus Link:Fr. isolates. Aflatoxin B(1) levels in harvested ears were determined using an indirect competitive ELISA. Molecular markers were assayed on the populations and used to generate maps. Molecular marker - QTL associations for lower levels of aflatoxin production were determined using multiple regression (MR) and composite interval analysis with multiple regression (CIM MR). MR revealed sets of markers associated with lower aflatoxin production in 1996 and 1997, and CIM MR detected a smaller subset of loci significant in 1997. QTLs for lower aflatoxin were attributed to both Tex6 and B73 parental sources. Environment strongly influenced the detection of QTLs for lower aflatoxin production in different years. There were very few chromosome regions associated with QTLs in more than 1 year or population with MR analysis, and none with CIM MR analysis. In 1997, QTLs for lower aflatoxin were detected with CIM MR in bins 5.01-2 and 5.04-5 in the BC(1)S(1) population, and in bins 3.05-6, 4.07-8 and 10.05-10.07 in the F(2:3) population. These QTL associations appear the most promising for further study.",2003,12677406,no
[Oral histoplasmosis 34 years after return of Africa].,"Histoplasmosis is a tropical fungal infection sharing many similarities with tuberculosis: the transmission by air dropplets, the usually asymptomatic primary-infection, the disseminated infection encountered among immunosuppressed patients and the granulomatous pathological lesions. In France, histoplasmosis is uncommon and may be misdiagnosed as tuberculosis.A 78 years old male patient presents with a raspberry-like lesion of the mouth causing difficulties to eat and weight loss of 14 kg. The diagnosis of tuberculosis is evoked because of the presence of a giant-cell granuloma in one of the biopsies. The histoplasmosis serology, requested because the patient stayed in Africa, is positive. Revisions of the pathology put into evidence the presence of spores in histiocytes confirming diagnosis of histoplasmosis. The treatment with itraconazole is effective.Histoplasmosis is a differential diagnosis of tuberculosis, especially in endemic regions. The histoplasmosis serology can be useful.

Nuclear transport factor 2 represents a novel cross-reactive fungal allergen.,"Ubiquitously occuring moulds are important allergenic sources known to elicit IgE-mediated allergic diseases and to share cross-reactive allergens. Limited information is available about the molecular structures involved in cross-reactivity. We aimed to clone and characterize cross-reactive mould allergens.Phage surface-displayed Alternaria alternata and Cladosporium herbarum cDNA libraries were screened using sera from Aspergillus fumigatus-sensitized patients. Inserts encoding putative allergens were sequenced, and recombinant proteins used to demonstrate cross-reactivity by inhibition experiments and skin test. Three-dimensional homology models of cloned putative nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2) were constructed based on known NTF2 structure to corroborate the functional and structural properties of the novel allergens.After six rounds of affinity selection, the libraries were enriched for clones displaying allergens. Sequencing of inserts showed that some clones derived from Alternaria alternata and Cladosporium herbarum contain open reading frames predicting proteins of 124 and 125 amino acids corresponding to NTF2. The recombinant proteins were able to bind and cross-inhibit IgE binding and to elicit type I skin reactions in mould-sensitized individuals, demonstrating the allergenicity of the proteins.NTF2 represents a novel cross-reactive fungal allergen as demonstrated by sequence homology, three-dimensional modelling, inhibition experiments and skin test reactivity.",2003,12653793,no
Hypersensitivity to molds in New York City in adults who have asthma.,"Molds have been linked epidemiologically to asthma as a key aeroallergen in several studies. Other allergens such as cockroach have been linked to asthma in New York City (NYC). To our knowledge, however, the pattern of mold hypersensitivity has never been examined systematically in the NYC area. Thus, we sought to determine the association between mold hypersensitivity and asthma in a large group of ambulatory patients evaluated for allergic disease for the years 1993 through 2001 at a single medical center. Serological testing for mold-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) as well as IgE specific for other aeroallergens was performed and the associations between allergen-specific IgE and the presence of asthma were examined using bivariate and multivariate analysis. Factor analysis showed that three distinct groupings of aeroallergen-specific IgE existed within the panel of allergens used. Group 1 consisted of cat dander and dust mites (Dermatophagoides farinae). Group 2 consisted of tree, grass, and ragweed pollen. Group 3 consisted of the Deuteromycetes molds, Alternaria tenuis, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Cladosporium herbarum. Patients with asthma had a highly significant increase in the incidence of hypersensitivity to cat/dust mites and to the molds. Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of hypersensitivity to either A. tenuis or C. herbarum had a significant independent association with asthma after adjustment for cat/dust mite hypersensitivity and after adjustment for other clinical factors. On the other hand, pollen hypersensitivity was not associated independently with asthma. Mold hypersensitivity was strongly correlated with hypersensitivity to cat or dust mites in patients who did not have asthma but not in patients who did have asthma. In the NYC area, recent pollen and spore counts show that mold spores are measurable in at least 75% of the year. Thus it is conceivable that mold hypersensitivity plays a contributing and independent role in initiating or perpetuating the allergic response in patients with asthma in the New York area.",2003,12635573,no
Evaluation of a polymerase chain reaction reverse hybridization line probe assay for the detection and identification of medically important fungi in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids.,"An assay system in which polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the ITS-1 region of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is combined with a reverse-hybridization line probe assay (LiPA) was used for the identification of six Candida species and four Aspergillus species in pure cultures of clinical isolates, as well as in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples from 42 patients with various underlying diseases. The results were compared with the results obtained with conventional routine identification methods as well as with a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) galactomannan detection assay and an Aspergillus-specific PCR. No discrepancies between the PCR-LiPA system and routine methods were found for pure cultures of Candida and Aspergillus species except in the case of Aspergillus versicolor. In BAL fluid samples in which Candida species were cultured, the PCR-LiPA system identified more species than did the routine methods. When routine analyses of patient samples were supplemented by adding data obtained by repurifying and re-identifying cultures and by taking isolates obtained from other body sites into account, the results agreed with PCR-LiPA system results in 81% of the cases (34/42). Most of the remaining discrepancies (6/8) involved cases in which such supplementary data were not available. In BAL fluid samples from which A. fumigatus was cultured, the agreement between the PCR-LiPA system and the routine methods was low. Only 2 of 11 BAL samples shown to contain A. fumigatus in ELISA and genus-specific PCR assays were positive in PCR-LiPA system. The PCR-LiPA system enables the simultaneous detection and identification of different fungal species present in pure or mixed populations within 6 h in a single assay.

Structures of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchors from Aspergillus fumigatus membrane proteins.,"Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins have been identified in all eukaryotes. In fungi, structural and biosynthetic studies of GPIs have been restricted to the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this article, four GPI-anchored proteins were purified from a membrane preparation of the human filamentous fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Using new methodology applied to western blot protein bands, the GPI structures were characterized by ES-MS, fluorescence labeling, HPLC, and specific enzymatic digestions. The phosphatidylinositol moiety of the A. fumigatus GPI membrane anchors was shown to be an inositol-phosphoceramide containing mainly phytosphingosine and monohydroxylated C24:0 fatty acid. In constrast to yeast, only ceramide was found in the GPI anchor structures of A. fumigatus, even for Gel1p, a homolog of Gas1p in S. cerevisiae that contains diacylglycerol. The A. fumigatus GPI glycan moiety is mainly a linear pentomannose structure linked to a glucosamine residue: Manalpha1-3Manalpha1-2Manalpha1-2Manalpha1-6Manalpha1-4GlcN.",2003,12626404,no
Multicenter evaluation of an enzyme immunoassay (Platelia Aspergillus) for the detection of Aspergillus antigen in serum.,"Invasive aspergillosis is a serious problem for immunocompromised patients, especially if neutropenic. The diagnosis of this infection is complicated, since clinical symptoms are often similar to those of other fungal diseases. The chance of detecting the presence of a specific antigen in the serum could confirm the suspected clinical diagnosis and. perhaps, be useful for the follow-up of the patient. The Medical Mycology Committee of the Associazione Microbiologi Clinici Italiani (AMCLI) decided to evaluate in a multicenter prospective study (from I November 1998 to 28 February 1999) the performance of the Platelia Aspergillus Kit (Bio-Rad) for the detection of Aspergillus galactomannan in human serum. The enrolled patients included various groups of immunosuppressed patients (mostly neutropenic). Blood samples were drawn at the time of enrollment. This decision was based upon a clinical diagnosis of probable aspergillosis (antibiotic non-responsive fever for at least 96 hours, cough, hemophthosis and positive chest X-ray). Additional blood samples were drawn on days 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 21. Culture and histopathologic examinations were performed according to the individual laboratory workflow. For each patient the laboratory filled a form with all the available clinical information, to create a database on which to evaluate the results of the test. During the study, 187 patients with various kinds of immunosuppression were enrolled. A total of 256 sera were tested: for 117 patients (62.6%) only the basal sample was tested, whereas for the 70 symptomatic patients (37.4%) multiple specimens (range: 1-6) were tested. The results allowed the laboratories to exclude (68.6%) or confirm (31.5%: confirmed and/or probable) the clinical diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis 4 cases remained undetermined. Based on the results of this study, it seems that the use of this test should be limited to those patients with clinical symptoms of aspergillosis.",2003,12617498,no
Pulmonary hyalinizing granuloma associated with Aspergillus infection.,"A 38-year-old immunocompetent man with occupational exposure to Aspergillus presented with dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and hemoptysis. Chest roentgenograms and computed tomography scans demonstrated multiple pulmonary nodules bilaterally. An initial set of bronchial washing cultures grew Aspergillus fumigatus, serologic testing showed an elevated anti-Aspergillus titer, and immunodiffusion testing was positive for antibody against A. fumigatus and A. niger. There was no microbiologic or serologic evidence of infection by other pathogens, and no clinical or laboratory evidence of autoimmune disease. An open lung biopsy was diagnostic of pulmonary hyalinizing granuloma. This novel association with Aspergillus infection not only expands the spectrum of pathogens linked to pulmonary hyalinizing granuloma but also documents a new pattern of lung disease that can be caused by Aspergillus.",2003,12598920,no
Allergen detection from 11 fungal species before and after germination.,"Allergens dispersed by airborne fungal spores play an important but poorly understood role in the underlying cause and exacerbation of asthma. Previous studies suggest that spores of Alternaria and Aspergillus release greater quantities of allergen after germination than before germination. It is unknown whether this is true of other allergenic fungi.Our purpose was to investigate the release of allergen from a range of individual fungal spores before and after germination.Allergen expression from spores of Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium herbarum, Aspergillus fumigatus, Botrytis cinerea, Epicoccum nigrum, Exserohilum rostratum, Penicillium chrysogenum, Stemphylium botryosum, Curvularia lunata, Trichoderma viride, and Bipolaris spicifera was examined by halogen immunoassays through the use of pooled serum IgE from patients allergic to fungus. Spores were deposited onto protein-binding membranes direct from culture. To germinate spores, samples were incubated in high humidity at room temperature for 48 hours. Ungerminated and germinated samples were then laminated with an adhesive film and immunostained by the halogen assay. The samples were examined by light microscopy, and positive counts (haloed particles) were expressed as percentages of total spores.For 9 of 11 species, between 5.7% and 92% of spores released allergen before germination. Spores of Penicillium and Trichoderma did not release detectable allergen. After germination, all spores that germinated had allergen elution from their hyphae. Eight of 11 species showed a significant increase (P <.05) in the percentage of spores eluting detectable allergen. Localization of allergen along the hyphae varied with species, such that some eluted allergen mainly from hyphal tips and septal junctions whereas others eluted allergen along the entire length.Increased elution of allergen after germination might be a common feature of many species of allergenic fungi. Although allergens from both spores and hyphae were recognized by human IgE, the extent to which human exposure occurs to allergens eluted from inhaled spores or from hyphae that germinate after deposition in the respiratory tract remains to be explored. The patterns of allergen expression might affect the clinical response to such exposure.",2003,12589346,no
"YPXL/I is a protein interaction motif recognized by aspergillus PalA and its human homologue, AIP1/Alix.","The zinc finger transcription factor PacC undergoes two-step proteolytic activation in response to alkaline ambient pH. PalA is a component of the fungal ambient pH signal transduction pathway. Its mammalian homologue AIP1/Alix interacts with the apoptosis-linked protein ALG-2. We show that both PalA and AIP1/Alix recognize a protein-protein binding motif that we denote YPXL/I, where Tyr, Pro, and Leu/Ile are crucial for its interactive properties. Two such motifs flanking the signaling protease cleavage site mediate direct binding of PalA to PacC, required for the first and only pH-regulated cleavage of this transcription factor. PalA can bind the ""closed"" (i.e., wild-type full-length) conformer of PacC, suggesting that PalA binding constitutes the first stage in the two-step proteolytic cascade, recruiting or facilitating access of the signaling protease, presumably PalB. In addition to recognizing YPXL/I motifs, both PalA and AIP1/Alix interact with the Aspergillus class E Vps protein Vps32 homologue, a member of a protein complex involved in the early steps of the multivesicular body pathway, suggesting that this interaction is an additional feature of proteins of the PalA/AIP1/Alix family.",2003,12588984,no
Comparative study on the characterization of antisera of anti-aflatoxin B1 from rabbit and laying hen.,"Polyclonal antisera specific for aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) were developed in rabbits and laying hens immunized with AFB1 conjugated to bovine serum albumin (AFB1-BSA). During the immunization schedule, AFB1-specific antisera from rabbits started to obviously be secreted after 60 days of the first AFB1-BSA injection, reached to a peak at day 120, and started to go down at day 135 while in regard to laying hens, antibodies began to largely be produced at day 90, arrived to a peak at day 135, and began to go down at day 165. The rabbits consistently produced anti-AFB1 antisera in 2-fold higher amounts than the laying hens during the antisera production process. But rabbits' and laying hens' antisera to AFB1 were found not to be apparently different in cross-reaction with aflatoxin analogs. Both rabbits' and laying hens' antisera could be used as immunological reagents for detecting AFB1 in agricultural commodities.",2003,12577594,no
Examining the role of glutamic acid 183 in chloroperoxidase catalysis.,"Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to investigate the role of glutamic acid 183 in chloroperoxidase catalysis. Based on the x-ray crystallographic structure of chloroperoxidase, Glu-183 is postulated to function on distal side of the heme prosthetic group as an acid-base catalyst in facilitating the reaction between the peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide with the formation of Compound I. In contrast, the other members of the heme peroxidase family use a histidine residue in this role. Plasmids have now been constructed in which the codon for Glu-183 is replaced with a histidine codon. The mutant recombinant gene has been expressed in Aspergillus niger. An analysis of the produced mutant gene shows that the substitution of Glu-183 with a His residue is detrimental to the chlorination and dismutation activity of chloroperoxidase. The activity is reduced by 85 and 50% of wild type activity, respectively. However, quite unexpectedly, the epoxidation activity of the mutant enzyme is significantly enhanced approximately 2.5-fold. These results show that Glu-183 is important but not essential for the chlorination activity of chloroperoxidase. It is possible that the increased epoxidation of the mutant enzyme is based on an increase in the hydrophobicity of the active site.",2003,12576477,no
AFLMP1 encodes an antigenic cel wall protein in Aspergillus flavus.,"We have previously reported the cloning and characterization of the MP1 gene in Penicillium marneffei and the AFMP1 gene in Aspergillus fumigatus and their use for serodiagnosis of penicilliosis and aspergilloma and invasive aspergillosis, respectively. In this study, we describe the cloning of the AFLMP1 gene, which encodes the homologous antigenic cell wall protein in Aspergillus flavus, the most common Aspergillus species associated with human disease in our locality and in other Asian countries and the second most common Aspergillus species associated with human disease in Western countries. AFLMP1 codes for a protein, Aflmp1p, of 273 amino acid residues, with a few sequence features that are present in Mp1p and Afmp1p, the homologous antigenic cell wall proteins in P. marneffei and A. fumigatus, respectively, as well as several other cell wall proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans. It contains a serine- and threonine-rich region for O glycosylation, a signal peptide, and a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol attachment signal sequence. Specific anti-Aflmp1p antibody was generated with recombinant Aflmp1p protein purified from Escherichia coli to allow further characterization of Aflmp1p. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis indicated that Aflmp1p is present on the surface of the hyphae of A. flavus. Finally, it was observed that patients with aspergilloma and invasive aspergillosis due to A. flavus develop a specific antibody response against Aflmp1p. This suggested that the recombinant protein and its antibody may be useful for serodiagnosis in patients with aspergilloma or invasive aspergillosis, and the protein may represent a good cell surface target for host humoral immunity.",2003,12574298,no
"Immunoglobulin E-binding and skin test reactivity to hydrophobin HCh-1 from Cladosporium herbarum, the first allergenic cell wall component of fungi.","For many years, fungal spores have been recognized as potential causes of respiratory allergies. All fungal allergens cloned so far represent either secreted or cytoplasmatic proteins, but nothing is known about the involvement of fungal surface proteins in allergic diseases.A phage surface displayed cDNA-library from the mould Cladosporium herbarum was constructed and phage displaying IgE-binding proteins were selectively enriched with immobilized serum IgE from C. herbarum-sensitized individuals. Inserts encoding putative allergens were sequenced, subcloned and used to produce recombinant proteins. Allergenicity of the proteins was evaluated by IgE binding in Western blots, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and skin prick test in a total of 84 patients sensitized to either C. herbarum or Aspergillus fumigatus and three healthy controls.After four rounds of affinity selection, the cDNA-library was enriched for clones displaying IgE-binding molecules. Sequencing of inserts showed that one clone contained an open reading frame predicting a protein of 105 amino acids and a calculated molecular weight of 10.5 kDa showing the classical signature of members of the hydrophobin family. The recombinant protein, termed HCh-1, was able to bind IgE from six patients sensitized to fungi in vitro. Two of those patients were also included in a skin prick test survey and showed strong type I skin reactions to HCh-1, demonstrating the allergenic nature of C. herbarum hydrophobin and indicating a prevalence of sensitization in the range of 8-9%. In contrast, the hydrophobin HYP1 from Aspergillus fumigatus was not recognized by the sera of the same patients and controls investigated with HCh-1.C. herbarum hydrophobin represents the first component of the cell wall of fungi demonstrated to act as a rare but clinically relevant allergen in vitro and in vivo.",2003,12534552,no
German cockroach extract increases bronchial epithelial cell interleukin-8 expression.,"Cockroach exposure has been recognized as a common trigger for asthma. While dust mite and Aspergillus fumigatus aeroallergens have been noted to have direct effects on airway epithelium, direct effects of cockroach proteins have not been determined.The purpose of this study was to investigate whether cockroach extract has a direct pro-inflammatory effect on airway epithelium.We examined the effect of crude German cockroach (Blattella germanica) extract on IL-8 expression in a human bronchial epithelial cell line (16HBE14o-cells) and primary human bronchial epithelial cells. Transcription from the IL-8 promoter and protein abundance were determined by reporter assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Endotoxin levels in the crude cockroach extracts were determined using the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate assay. Protease activity was assessed using Azocoll as a substrate.We found that crude cockroach extract induced a synergistic increase in TNF-alpha-induced transcription from the IL-8 promoter. The synergistic effect was observed with as little as 0.3 micro g/mL of crude cockroach extract, while larger concentrations (30 micro g/mL) approximately doubled TNF-alpha-induced IL-8 promoter activity. Similar effects of cockroach extract on IL-8 protein abundance were observed in both 16HBE14o- and primary human bronchial epithelial cells. Addition of endotoxin at concentrations found in the cockroach extract had no effect on TNF-alpha-mediated IL-8 expression. The serine protease inhibitors aprotinin and phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride abolished cockroach-induced synergy, while the cysteine protease inhibitors E64 and leupeptin had little effect. Measurement of protease activity using Azocoll as a substrate confirmed the presence of protease activity in cockroach extracts. Addition of recombinant Bla g 2, Bla g 3 and Bla g 5 had no effect on TNF-alpha-induced IL-8 promoter activation. Finally, cockroach extract also increased TNF-alpha-induced transcription from the IL-6 promoter.German cockroach extract contains novel serine protease activity which has a direct pro-inflammatory effect on airway epithelial cells",2003,12534547,no
[Preparation and identification of monoclonal antibodies against Penicillium marneffei].,"To prepare and identify monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against Penicillium marneffei.Recombinant mannoprotein1 (MP1) of Penicillium marneffei was used to immunize BALB/c mice, and anti-MP1 mAbs were obtained by means of hybridoma. Screening and identification of the mAbs were subsequently performed with indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting, respectively.Four hybridomas producing antibodies against Penicillium marneffei were obtained, and the IgG isotypes of the 4 mAbs were identified as IgG1 with affinity constants (K) of 8.2x10(-9), 4.7x10(-9), 6.5x10(-9) and 2.7x10(-9), respectively. Western blotting demonstrated specific recognition of Aspergillus fumigatus MP1 by the obtained mAbs.The 4 hybridomas producing anti-MP1 mAbs with high specificity and affinity can be of significant value in the diagnosis of Penicilliosis marneffei infections.",2003,12527512,no
A cellulose-binding module of the Trichoderma reesei beta-mannanase Man5A increases the mannan-hydrolysis of complex substrates.,"Endo-beta-1,4-D-mannanases (beta-mannanase EC 3.2.1.78) are endohydrolases that participate in the degradation of hemicellulose, which is closely associated with cellulose in plant cell walls. The beta-mannanase from Trichoderma reesei (Man5A) is composed of an N-terminal catalytic module and a C-terminal carbohydrate-binding module (CBM). In order to study the properties of the CBM, a construct encoding a mutant of Man5A lacking the part encoding the CBM (Man5ADeltaCBM), was expressed in T. reesei under the regulation of the Aspergillus nidulans gpdA promoter. The wild-type enzyme was expressed in the same way and both proteins were purified to electrophoretic homogeneity using ion-exchange chromatography. Both enzymes hydrolysed mannopentaose, soluble locust bean gum galactomannan and insoluble ivory nut mannan with similar rates. With a mannan/cellulose complex, however, the deletion mutant lacking the CBM showed a significant decrease in hydrolysis. Binding experiments using activity detection of Man5A and Man5ADeltaCBM suggests that the CBM binds to cellulose but not to mannan. Moreover, the binding of Man5A to cellulose was compared with that of an endoglucanase (Cel7B) from T. reesei.",2003,12523968,no
Production of proinflammatory mediators by indoor air bacteria and fungal spores in mouse and human cell lines.,"We compared the inflammatory and cytotoxic responses caused by household mold and bacteria in human and mouse cell lines. We studied the fungi Aspergillus versicolor, Penicillium spinulosum, and Stachybotrys chartarum and the bacteria Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Streptomyces californicus for their cytotoxicity and ability to stimulate the production of inflammatory mediators in mouse RAW264.7 and human 28SC macrophage cell lines and in the human A549 lung epithelial cell line in 24-hr exposure to 10(5), 10(6), and 10(7) microbes/mL. We studied time dependency by terminating the exposure to 10(6) microbes/mL after 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hr. We analyzed production of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukins 6 and 1ss (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1ss, respectively) and measured nitric oxide production using the Griess method, expression of inducible NO-synthase with Western Blot analysis, and cytotoxicity with the MTT-test. All bacteria strongly induced the production of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and, to a lesser extent, the formation of IL-1ss in mouse macrophages. Only the spores of Str. californicus induced the production of NO and IL-6 in both human and mouse cells. In contrast, exposure to fungal strains did not markedly increase the production of NO or any cytokine in the studied cell lines except for Sta. chartarum, which increased IL-6 production somewhat in human lung epithelial cells. These microbes were less cytotoxic to human cells than to mouse cells. On the basis of equivalent numbers of bacteria and spores of fungi added to cell cultures, the overall potency to stimulate the production of proinflammatory mediators decreased in the order Ps. fluorescens > Str. californicus > B. cereus > Sta. chartarum > A. versicolor > P. spinulosum. These data suggest that bacteria in water-damaged buildings should also be considered as causative agents of adverse inflammatory effects.",2003,12515684,no
Multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay for the differential detection of trichothecene- and fumonisin-producing species of Fusarium in cornmeal.,"The genus Fusarium comprises a diverse group of fungi including several species that produce mycotoxins in food commodities. In this study, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed for the group-specific detection of fumonisin-producing and trichothecene-producing species of Fusarium. Primers for genus-level recognition of Fusarium spp. were designed from the internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS1 and ITS2) of rDNA. Primers for group-specific detection were designed from the TRI6 gene involved in trichothecene biosynthesis and the FUM5 gene involved in fumonisin biosynthesis. Primer specificity was determined by testing for cross-reactivity against purified genomic DNA from 43 fungal species representing 14 genera, including 9 Aspergillus spp., 9 Fusarium spp., and 10 Penicillium spp. With purified genomic DNA as a template, genus-specific recognition was observed at 10 pg per reaction group-specific recognition occurred at 100 pg of template per reaction for the trichothecene producer Fusarium graminearum and at 1 ng of template per reaction for the fumonisin producer Fusarium verticillioides. For the application of the PCR assay, a protocol was developed to isolate fungal DNA from cornmeal. The detection of F. graminearum and its differentiation from F. verticillioides were accomplished prior to visible fungal growth at <10(5) CFU/g of cornmeal. This level of detection is comparable to those of other methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the assay described here can be used in the food industry's effort to monitor quality and safety.",2002,12495016,no
Diagnosis of fungal infection: new technologies for the mycology laboratory.,"The dramatic increase in nosocomial invasive mycoses over the past two decades has led to increased interest in the area of antifungal development. Unfortunately, the infusion of new diagnostic technology into the clinical mycology laboratory has lagged behind. Although newer, automated, continuous-monitoring blood culture systems are as sensitive as the older, manual ""gold standard"" system, the recovery of fungi from blood, as well as other clinical specimens, remains an insensitive marker for invasive fungal infection. Antigen assays for the rapid diagnosis of invasive fungal infections are in development, and galactomannan and glucan are two such promising antigens. Glucan may be present in the blood of patients with infection secondary to a wide variety of fungal pathogens, including Candida, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Saccharomyces, Trichosporon and Acremonium species. Early data suggest galactomannan may be present in the blood in detectable levels very early in the course of invasive aspergillosis. The galactomannan assay currently undergoing evaluations may actually be positive prior to the clinical suspicion for infection and may be useful in monitoring therapeutic response as well however, the etiology of false-positive results following cytotoxic chemotherapy still has to be elucidated. PCR assays are also being developed in the research laboratory, however, the PCR assays will require a significant amount of adaptation and validation before they are ready for clinical care. Well-planned studies to evaluate the performance characteristics as well as appropriate clinical and cost-effective application of these new tests are needed.",2002,12486790,no
Aspergillus infections in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients: have we made any progress?,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is common in allogeneic SCT recipients, with an incidence of 4-10%. The majority of these infections are diagnosed several months after SCT and they are frequently associated with GVHD. The diagnosis is difficult and often delayed. Established IA is notoriously difficult to treat with a death rate of 80-90%. This review summarises recent data on this problem to assess whether there has been any progress. Effective prophylactic measures are still lacking. Severe immunosuppression is the main obstacle to the success of therapy. Recent and ongoing developments in diagnostic measures and new antifungal agents may improve treatment results to some extent, but Aspergillus infections still remain a formidable problem in allogeneic transplantation. Further studies in this field will focus on the role of various cytokines and combinations of antifungal agents.",2002,12476286,no
Aspergillus antigens associated with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"Among the molds causing allergy, Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) constituted a major species present both indoors and outdoors. The antigens both secreted and bound to hyphae and conidia have been isolated for immunodiagnosis of allergic aspergillosis. The crude extracts have been used to demonstrate IgE antibody in vitro and for skin testing. The crude extracts contain many antigenic and non-antigenic components and toxins and have demonstrated inconsistent reactivities. In addition, similarity with other allergens also may complicate specific diagnosis. A number of methods including conventional purification and fractionation methods have been used to obtain relevant antigens. In recent years, monoclonal antibody dependent affinity purification and molecular biology methods have obtained considerable progress in the allergen purification and in developing specific and reliable immunoassays. However, international standards are still lacking and hence, comparison of results among laboratories are not possible yet.",2002,12456371,no
Pathology of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) occurs in patients with asthma and cystic fibrosis when Aspergillus fumigatus spores are inhaled and grow in bronchial mucus as hyphae. Chronic colonization of Aspergillus fumigatus and host's genetically determined immunological response lead to ABPA. In most cases, lung biopsy is not necessary because the diagnosis is made on clinical, serologic, and roentgenographic findings. Some patients who have had lung biopsies or partial resections for atelectasis or infiltrates will have histologic diagnoses. A number of different histologic diagnoses can be found even in the same patient. In the early stages the bronchial wall is infiltrated with mononuclear cells and eosinophils. Mucoid impaction and eosinophilic pneumonia are seen subsequently. This may be followed by bronchiolitis obliterans, granulomatous bronchiolitis, and pulmonary fibrosis. Treatment with corticosteroids appears to prevent the progression of the disease.",2002,12456336,no
Post-harvest storage of corn: effect of beginning moisture content on mycoflora and fumonisin contamination.,"The effect of storage on mycoflora profile was monitored bimonthly in 36 corn (Zea mays L.) samples, dividing the same sample into groups dried to 11 and 14% moisture content (1008 analysis). These groups were further subdivided based on the initial total count (moulds and yeasts) up to 10(4) CFU g(-1) (12 samples, range 1.6 x 10(4) to 9.0 x 10(4), mean 3.8 x 10(4) CFU g(-1)) and up to 10(5) CFU g(-1) (24 samples, range 1.0 x 10(5) to 5.0 x 10(5), mean 2.7 x 10(5) CFU g(-1)). In the corn group dried to 11%, the fumonisin content was analysed at the initial stage (freshly harvested) and at the end of 12-month storage. Fusarium spp. and Penicillium spp. prevailed at the freshly harvested stage (100%), maintaining this profile throughout 12 months, in corn dried to both 11 and 14%. Cladosporium spp., Aspergillus spp. and Phoma spp. were also detected at lower frequencies during the storage. Fusarium spp. and the total fungal colony count during 12-month storage carried out with samples dried to 11 or 14% moisture content were statistically evaluated using ANOVA for randomized complete block design. The correlation between storage time and Fusarium spp. and total fungal colony count data was analysed by Pearson's correlation test. There was no difference in Fusarium spp. and total counts in the 10(4) CFU g(-1) initial total count group throughout the storage time (p < 0.05). There was a negative correlation between fungal population and storage time (p < 0.05) in the 10(5) CFU g(-1) initial total count group. Fumonisins were detected in all freshly harvested corn, at a mean concentration of 9.9 +/- 6.0 micro g g(-1) (range 0.74-22.6 micro g g(-)1). These values did not change in the 12-month stored corn (mean of 9.9 +/- 5.8 micro g g(-1), range 0.81-23.7 micro g g(-1)). These post harvest data indicated the importance of moisture content at the crop harvesting/predrying stage to control fungal growth and further fumonisin production.",2002,12456280,no
Spores of Aspergillus versicolor isolated from indoor air of a moisture-damaged building provoke acute inflammation in mouse lungs.,"Microbial growth in moisture-damaged buildings has been associated with respiratory health effects, and the spores of the mycotoxin producing fungus Aspergillus versicolor are frequently present in the indoor air. To characterize the potential of these spores to cause harmful respiratory effects, mice were exposed via intratracheal instillation to a single dose of the spores of A. versicolor (1 x 10(5), 1 x 10(6), 5 x 10(6), 1 x 10(7), or 1 x 10(8) spores), isolated from the indoor air of a moisture-damaged building. Inflammation and toxicity in lungs were evaluated 24 h later by assessment of biochemical markers and histopathology. The time course of the effects was investigated with the dose of 5 x 10(6) spores for up to 28 days. The exposure to the spores increased transiently proinflammatory cytokine levels (tumor necrosis factor [TNF] alpha and interleukin [IL]-6) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The cytokine responses were dose and time dependent. The highest cytokine concentrations were measured at 6 h after the dose, and they returned to the control level by 3 days. Moreover, the spores of A. versicolor recruited inflammatory cells into airways: Neutrophils peaked transiently at 24 h, macrophages at 3 days, and lymphocytes at 7 days after the dosing. The inflammatory cell response did not completely disappear during the subsequent 28 days, though no histopathological changes were seen at that time point. The spores did not induce expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in lavaged cells. Only the highest spore dose (1 x 10(8)) markedly increased serum IL-6, increased vascular leakage, and caused cytotoxicity (i.e., increased levels of albumin, total protein, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], and hemoglobin in BALF) in the airways. In summary, the spores of A. versicolor caused acute inflammation in mouse lungs. This indicates that they have potential to provoke adverse health effects in the occupants of moisture-damaged buildings.",2002,12454790,no
The prospective evaluation of a nested polymerase chain reaction assay for the early detection of Aspergillus infection in patients with leukaemia or undergoing allograft treatment.,"Patients with acute leukaemia or undergoing allogenic bone marrow transplantation at University College London Hospital Trust were screened for the presence of aspergillosis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Aspergillus DNA, from whole blood samples, was amplified by nested PCR to detect a 135 bp fragment in the mitochondrial region of Aspergillus fumigatus or A. flavus (121 bp). One colony-forming unit (CFU) per 2 ml of blood or 1-10 fg DNA could be detected. Patients at risk of aspergillosis were classified as probable or possible based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer definitions. Antifungal drugs given were recorded. In four of 17 patients studied, infection was not suspected and the PCR was negative. Four patients were considered to have possible aspergillosis infection and were PCR positive on at least one occasion. Of the three patients in the probable group, four of the nine samples tested PCR positive from one patient and in another patient only one of nine samples tested positive. The remaining six patients were not suspected of having fungal infection but each had one or two PCR-positive results. In summary, six of seven patients thought to have clinical evidence of infection were PCR positive on at least one occasion and treatment with antifungals may have reduced infection below detectable levels.",2002,12437651,no
Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised children.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a serious life-threatening complication in immunocompromised children. The commonest risk groups are children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, leukaemia, corticosteroid and other immunosuppressive therapy, chronic granulomatous disease and severe combined immunodeficiency as well as neonates. The clinical manifestations are heterogeneous and many organ systems can be involved. Diagnosis based on the clinical presentation alone is cumbersome. Innovative and sensitive laboratory test systems which detect fungal antigens or DNA in clinical specimens have been recently developed. Specific Aspergillus antibody detection using recombinant antigen technique has also been introduced. Although each individual technique has drawbacks, the combined use of culture with antigen and antibody ELISA as well as PCR should result in an earlier and more definitive diagnosis of IA in children presenting with clinical and/or radiological signs of aspergillosis. In high risk children these methods are valuable for serial screening and early detection of Aspergillus infection. The implementation of accurate diagnostic criteria and standardised diagnostic flow charts in children at risk will lead to a better outcome of IA in the future.definite, well-timed early diagnosis and sufficient therapy is elementary for a successful outcome of invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised children. To date, the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis remains a combination of clinical presentation, radiology and microbiological tests.",2002,12424579,no
Invasive aspergillosis in cancer.,"Ten confirmed cases of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in cancer patients were analysed retrospectively. Eight were pulmonary, one was sinonasal and one was cutaneous. The majority of patients had haematological malignancies (7), the remaining three were cases of solid tumours. Fever was present in all 10 cases. Cough and lung signs were present in all eight cases of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Haemoptysis was encountered in three of nine cases of pulmonary and sinonasal aspergillosis. Mortality was low (2%). While corticosteroids, antibiotics and anticancer chemotherapy/radiotherapy were factors predisposing the patients to IA, neutropenia was perhaps responsible for their mortality. Seven of the patients had other associated pathogens isolated in culture in addition to Aspergillus spp. Aspergillus fumigatus was the predominant species, followed by A. flavus, A. glaucus, A. nidulans and A. niger. Direct microscopic examination (in six of seven cases) and culture (six of seven cases) correlated well with radiographic and clinical findings in cases with lung involvement. Serology for anti-Aspergillus antibodies performed by gel diffusion precipitin test was positive in one case of sinonasal aspergillosis, wherein only one precipitin band was observed. Correlation of clinical symptoms, consistent radiographic findings and microbiological work-up (the latter including a triad of direct microscopy, culture and serology) are required to arrive at a diagnosis of IA, especially where histology cannot form the mainstay of diagnosis.",2002,12421281,no
Expression in bacteria of the gene encoding the gp43 antigen of paracoccidioides brasiliensis: immunological reactivity of the recombinant fusion proteins.,"gp43 is the major diagnostic antigen of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, the agent of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) in humans. In the present study, cDNA of the gp43 gene (PbGP43) was obtained by reverse transcriptase PCR, inserted into a pGEX vector in frame with the glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene, and expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies. Immunoblotting showed that all sera from patients with chronic pulmonary and acute lymphatic forms of PCM reacted with the recombinant fusion protein of the mature gp43 (381 amino acids). Reactivity with fusion proteins containing subfragments of the N-terminal, internal, or C-terminal regions occurred eventually, and the C-terminal region was the most antigenic. Lack of reactivity with the subfragments may be due to the conformational nature of the gp43 epitopes. Sera from patients with aspergillosis, candidiasis, and histoplasmosis did not react with the gp43-GST fusion protein. Our results suggest that recombinant gp43 corresponding to the processed antigen can be a useful tool in the diagnosis of PCM.",2002,12414750,no
Detection of cell wall galactomannoprotein Afmp1p in culture supernatants of Aspergillus fumigatus and in sera of aspergillosis patients.,"Mannoproteins are important and abundant structural components of fungal cell walls. The AFMP1 gene encodes a cell wall galactomannoprotein of Aspergillus fumigatus. In the present study, we show that Afmp1p is secreted into the cell culture supernatant at a level that can be detected by Western blotting. A sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) developed with antibodies against Afmp1p was capable of detecting this protein from the cell culture supernatant of A. fumigatus. The anti-Afmp1p antibody is specific since it fails to react with any protein from lysates of Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus terreus, Penicillium marneffei, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Blastomyces dermatitidis, and Histoplasma capsulatum by Western blotting. In addition, this Afmp1p antigen-based ELISA is also specific for A. fumigatus since the cell culture supernatants of the other eight fungi gave negative results. Finally, a clinical evaluation of sera from invasive aspergillosis patients indicates that 8 of 15 (53%) patients are Afmp1p antigen test positive. Furthermore, an Afmp1p antibody test was performed with these serum specimens. The combined antibody and antigen tests for invasive aspergillosis carry a sensitivity of 86.7% (13 of 15). The specificities of the tests are high since none of the 138 control sera, including 100 from normal blood donors, 20 from patients with penicilliosis marneffei, 6 from patients with candidemia, 8 from patients with typhoid fever, and 4 from patients with melioidosis, was positive by either test.

Function of native OmtA in vivo and expression and distribution of this protein in colonies of Aspergillus parasiticus.,"The activities of two enzymes, a 168-kDa protein and a 40-kDa protein, OmtA, purified from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus parasiticus were reported to convert the aflatoxin pathway intermediate sterigmatocystin to O-methylsterigmatocystin in vitro. Our initial goal was to determine if OmtA is necessary and sufficient to catalyze this reaction in vivo and if this reaction is necessary for aflatoxin synthesis. We generated A. parasiticus omtA-null mutant LW1432 and a maltose binding protein-OmtA fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli. Enzyme activity analysis of OmtA fusion protein in vitro confirmed the reported catalytic function of OmtA. Feeding studies conducted with LW1432 demonstrated a critical role for OmtA, and the reaction catalyzed by this enzyme in aflatoxin synthesis in vivo. Because of a close regulatory link between aflatoxin synthesis and asexual sporulation (conidiation), we hypothesized a spatial and temporal association between OmtA expression and conidiospore development. We developed a novel time-dependent colony fractionation protocol to analyze the accumulation and distribution of OmtA in fungal colonies grown on a solid medium that supports both toxin synthesis and conidiation. OmtA-specific polyclonal antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography using an LW1432 protein extract. OmtA was not detected in 24-h-old colonies but was detected in 48-h-old colonies using Western blot analysis the protein accumulated in all fractions of a 72-h-old colony, including cells (0 to 24 h) in which little conidiophore development was observed. OmtA in older fractions of the colony (24 to 72 h) was partly degraded. Fluorescence-based immunohistochemical analysis conducted on thin sections of paraffin-embedded fungal cells from time-fractionated fungal colonies demonstrated that OmtA is evenly distributed among different cell types and is not concentrated in conidiophores. These data suggest that OmtA is present in newly formed fungal tissue and then is proteolytically cleaved as cells in that section of the colony age.",2002,12406770,no
Use of circulating galactomannan screening for early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients.,"Screening for galactomannan (GM) has been adopted by many European centers as part of the management plan for allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients. However, the temporal onset of GM antigenemia remains unknown. A series of allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients were monitored prospectively, and the relationship between antigenemia and other diagnostic triggers for initiation of antifungal therapy was analyzed. GM detection had a sensitivity of 94.4% and a specificity of 98.8%. Positive and negative predictive values were 94.4% and 98.8%, respectively. This statistical profile was better than that of other triggers, including unexplained fever, new pulmonary infiltrates, isolation of Aspergillus species, and abnormalities seen on computed tomography. Antigenemia preceded diagnosis on the basis of radiologic examination or Aspergillus isolation by 8 and 9 days in 80% and 88.8% of patients, respectively. Antigenemia preceded therapy in 83.3% of patients. Detection of GM was especially useful when patients were receiving steroid treatment or when coexisting conditions masked the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. Prospective screening for GM allows earlier diagnosis of aspergillosis than do conventional diagnostic criteria.",2002,12402199,yes
"[Advances in serological systems for diagnosis of systemic fungal infections, particularly those caused by Candida and Aspergillus].","Invasive fungal infections have emerged as important causes of morbidity and mortality in neutropenicand some other immunocompromised hosts Candida and Aspergillus are among the major pathogens in this patient population. The clinical diagnosis of these infections is not specific and the traditional mycological methods for them not sensitive, with limits in the early detection of the pathogen. The potential additives or complements to the laboratory diagnosis of invasive candidiasis and aspergillosis are two non-culture-based methods, serodiagnostic methods and molecular ones. The former methods include the detection of pathogen-specific antigens, antibodies, metabolites and cell wall components. Several have already become standard laboratory tools and some others are under active investigation for developing new, more accurate detection systems. In this review, I will discuss the current status and future potential of serodiagnostic methods, highlighting both their technical and clinical implications.",2002,12402023,no
Phosphorylation of the mitotic regulator protein Hec1 by Nek2 kinase is essential for faithful chromosome segregation.,"Hec1 (highly expressed in cancer) plays essential roles in chromosome segregation by interacting through its coiled-coil domains with several proteins that modulate the G(2)/M phase. Hec1 localizes to kinetochores, and its inactivation either by genetic deletion or antibody neutralization leads to severe and lethal chromosomal segregation errors, indicating that Hec1 plays a critical role in chromosome segregation. The mechanisms by which Hec1 is regulated, however, are not known. Here we show that human Hec1 is a serine phosphoprotein and that it binds specifically to the mitotic regulatory kinase Nek2 during G(2)/M. Nek2 phosphorylates Hec1 on serine residue 165, both in vitro and in vivo. Yeast cells are viable without scNek2/Kin3, a close structural homolog of Nek2 that binds to both human and yeast Hec1. When the same yeasts carry an scNek2/Kin3 (D55G) or Nek2 (E38G) mutation to mimic a similar temperature-sensitive nima mutation in Aspergillus, their growth is arrested at the nonpermissive temperature, because the scNek2/Kin3 (D55G) mutant binds to Hec1 but fails to phosphorylate it. Whereas wild-type human Hec1 rescues lethality resulting from deletion of Hec1 in Saccharomyces cerevesiae, a human Hec1 mutant or yeast Hec1 mutant changing Ser(165) to Ala or yeast Hec1 mutant changing Ser(201) to Ala does not. Mutations changing the same Ser residues to Glu, to mimic the negative charge created by phosphorylation, partially rescue lethality but result in a high incidence of errors in chromosomal segregation. These results suggest that cell cycle-regulated serine phosphorylation of Hec1 by Nek2 is essential for faithful chromosome segregation.",2002,12386167,no
Influence of mannan epitopes in glycoproteins--Concanavalin A interaction. Comparison of natural and synthetic glycosylated proteins.,"Two natural glycoproteins/glycoenzymes, invertase and glucoamylase, and two neoglycoconjugates, synthetized from Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan, bovine serum albumin and penicillin G acylase were tested for interaction with lectin Concanavalin A (Con A). The interaction of natural and synthetic glycoproteins with Con A was studied using three different experimental methods: (i). quantitative precipitation in solution (ii). sorption to Con A immobilized on bead cellulose and (iii). kinetic measurement of the interaction by surface plasmon resonance. Prepared neoglycoproteins were further characterized: saccharide content, molecular weight, polydispersion, kinetic and equilibrium association constants with Con A were determined. It can be concluded that the used conjugation method proved to be able to produce neoglycoproteins with similar properties like natural glycoproteins, i.e. enzymatic activity (protein part) and lectin binding activity (mannan part) were preserved and the neoglycoconjugates interact with Con A similarly as natural mannan-type glycoproteins.",2002,12297232,no
IgE-mediated allergy to phytase -- a new animal feed additive.,"Although fungal phytase is frequently used as an additive to animal feed few investigations of its allergenic property have been conducted.Fifty-three subjects occupationally exposed to powdered phytase from Aspergillus niger were studied. Exposure data and symptoms were registered by the company physician.Thirty-eight subjects complained of work-related respiratory symptoms and 14 of them showed phytase-specific IgE antibodies only one asymptomatic subject revealed such antibodies. IgE antibodies were significantly more frequently found in the high-exposure group (technical centre) when compared with the low-exposure group (laboratories, experimental animal husbandry). Phytase-specific IgG antibodies were present in 19 symptomatic (50%) and five (33%) asymptomatic subjects.Our results demonstrate that powdered fungal phytase is a highly sensitizing substance whose inhalation exposure should be avoided. Hypersensitivity symptoms could be prevented by means of extensive hygienic measures and ongoing medical surveillance.",2002,12269943,no
Specific characterization of substrate and inhibitor binding sites of a glycosyl hydrolase family 11 xylanase from Aspergillus niger.,"The importance of aromatic and charged residues at the surface of the active site of a family 11 xylanase from Aspergillus niger was evaluated using site-directed mutagenesis. Ten mutant proteins were heterologously produced in Pichia pastoris, and their biochemical properties and kinetic parameters were determined. The specific activity of the Y6A, Y10A, Y89A, Y164A, and W172A mutant enzymes was drastically reduced. The low specific activities of Y6A and Y89A were entirely accounted for by a change in k(cat) and K(m), respectively, whereas the lower values of Y10A, Y164A, and W172A were due to a combination of increased K(m) and decreased k(cat). Tyr(6), Tyr(10), Tyr(89), Tyr(164), and Trp(172) are proposed as substrate-binding residues, a finding consistent with structural sequence alignments of family 11 xylanases and with the three-dimensional structure of the A. niger xylanase in complex with the modeled xylobiose. All other variants, D113A, D113N, N117A, E118A, and E118Q, retained full wild-type activity. Only N117A lost its sensitivity to xylanase inhibitor protein I (XIP-I), a protein inhibitor isolated from wheat, and this mutation did not affect the fold of the xylanase as revealed by circular dichroism. The N117A variant showed kinetics, pH stability, hydrolysis products pattern, substrate specificity, and structural properties identical to that of the wild-type xylanase. The loss of inhibition, as measured in activity assays, was due to abolition of the interaction between XIP-I and the mutant enzyme, as demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance and electrophoretic titration. A close inspection of the three-dimensional structure of A. niger xylanase suggests that the binding site of XIP-I is located at the conserved ""thumb"" hairpin loop of family 11 xylanases.",2002,12207016,no
A review of nucleic acid-based diagnostic tests for systemic mycoses with an emphasis on polymerase chain reaction-based assays.,"Nucleic acid-based assays have good potential to complement and enhance the sensitivity and rapidity of conventional methods used in diagnostic mycology. The majority of molecular tests are polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays focusing mainly on the detection of Candida and Aspergillus spp. from clinical samples. DNA extraction and purification procedures should be standardized and can be facilitated by using commercial extraction kits. In general, protocols that target multi-copy genes provide the greatest sensitivity. Objective endpoint assessments of PCR tests using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) or commercial quantitative systems are capable of rapidly detecting and identifying Candida and Aspergillus spp. Sequencing of PCR products can be used to confirm the identity of amplicons. In cases of suspected invasive aspergillosis, PCR should be performed on both blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid to maximize test sensitivity and the positive predictive value. At least two blood specimens should be tested if PCR is undertaken on blood samples alone. In situ hybridization techniques have been used with success to identify fungi in tissue specimens. The wide application of PCR-based assays relies on the introduction of standardized protocols following their evaluation in multicentre, prospective studies.",2002,12230214,no
Interplay between protective and inhibitory antibodies dictates the outcome of experimentally disseminated Candidiasis in recipients of a Candida albicans vaccine.,"Mice immunized with heat-inactivated, whole yeast-form cells (Y cells) of Candida albicans developed intense, specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. However, they were modestly protected against a lethal challenge by the fungus, and their sera did not confer passive protection upon nonimmunized animals. Surprisingly, this immune serum conferred an elevated degree of passive protection to normal and SCID mice when preadsorbed on whole C. albicans cells. After adsorption, no antibodies specific to mannoprotein (MP)-rich extracts or secretions were detected by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and no serum reaction with the fungal cell surface was seen in immunofluorescence assays. However, this serum had totally preserved the level of other antibodies, in particular those reacting with beta-1,3 and beta-1,6 glucan (GG). The hypothesis that anti-GG antibodies contributed to the passive protection was suggested by the following circumstantial evidence: (i) mice immunized with C. albicans cells treated with dithiothreitol and protease (YDP cells), which exposed GG on their surfaces and generated anti-GG but not anti-MP antibodies, were substantially protected against a lethal fungus challenge (ii) the sera, and their immunoglobulin fractions, of mice immunized with YDP cells transferred protection to nonimmune animals",2002,12228271,no
Ochratoxin A concentrations in food and feed from a region with Balkan Endemic Nephropathy.,"Balkan Endemic Nephropathy (BEN), a chronic renal disease of unknown aetiology, is found in geographically close areas of Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Ochratoxin A (OTA), a secondary metabolite of Aspergillus and Penicillium species and a natural contaminant of food and feed, is a putative cause of BEN. Some studies have found a geographic covariation between OTA content in food/feed and BEN manifestation others have not. In May 2000, using a competitive direct ELISA assay for OTA (detection limit 1 microg kg(-1)), we investigated OTA contamination in 165 samples of home-produced food (beans, potatoes, corn, wheat, flour) and feed from households in villages from the BEN region (Vratza district) of north-western Bulgaria. Samples were collected from: (a) BEN villages (n = 8), and therein from BEN households (20), and BEN-free households (16) (within-village controls, WVC households)",2002,12227939,no
Long-term evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: a case study follow-up and literature review.,"This study reports a 3-year follow-up of a classic presentation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), originally reported elsewhere, after removal of the causative antigens. The literature is reviewed and this case is compared with outcomes of series previously reported. The patient was reevaluated by clinical, serologic, radiographic, and pulmonary function testing 3 years after removal of her home's contaminated humidifier, cleaning of the home, and administration of a course of prednisone. Repeat serologic measurements revealed positive serum precipitins only for Aspergillus flavus and Phoma herbarum, significantly fewer than her original panel, which revealed precipitating antibodies to her humidifier water and 10 other specific antigens. Pulmonary function tests remained stable. Physical exam revealed bibasilar rales. Computed tomography scan revealed pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and honeycombing that was compared with 3 years earlier. Although most of the data obtained on reevaluation suggest remission, radiographic findings have not remitted. Long-term follow-up of parameters of HP disease activity do not always reveal consistent findings.

Development and evaluation of rapid urinary antigen detection tests for diagnosis of penicilliosis marneffei.,"Penicilliosis, caused by the dimorphic fungus Penicillium marneffei, is an important opportunistic systemic fungal infection affecting immunocompromised individuals living in areas where penicilliosis is endemic. We have demonstrated previously that a urinary enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against killed whole-fission-form arthroconidia of P. marneffei was specific and highly sensitive for the diagnosis of penicilliosis. In this study, a dot blot ELISA and a latex agglutination (LA) test were developed with the same polyclonal antibody and compared with the ELISA for the detection of P. marneffei urinary antigen. Urine specimens from 37 patients with culture-proven penicilliosis and 300 controls (52 healthy subjects and 248 hospitalized patients without penicilliosis) were tested. Antigen was detected in urine from all 37 (100%) penicilliosis patients by the LA test, 35 (94.6%) penicilliosis patients by the dot blot ELISA, and 36 (97.3%) penicilliosis patients by the ELISA. False-positive results were found by the three assays for 2 (0.7%), 8 (2.7%), and 6 (2%) of 300 controls, respectively. The overall sensitivities of the diagnostic tests were as follows: dot blot ELISA, 94.6% ELISA, 97.3%",2002,12202550,no
Regulation of bronchoalveolar macrophage proinflammatory cytokine production by dexamethasone and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor after stimulation by Aspergillus conidia or lipopolysaccharide.,"There is substantial evidence that local production of proinflammatory cytokines are very important in host resistance to aspergillosis. Dexamethasone (DEX) down-regulates production of these cytokines by stimulated bronchoalveolar macrophages (BAM) and constitutes a risk factor for aspergillosis. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) antagonizes DEX suppression of antifungal activity by BAM. Here we investigated the possibility that GM-CSF could antagonize DEX down-regulation of interleukin (IL)-1alpha and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production by stimulated BAM. Control BAM responded to increasing numbers of conidia of Aspergillus fumigatus with increasing production of IL-1 and TNF. DEX (10(-7)M) significantly suppressed IL-1 and TNF production by BAM+conidia. Although GM-CSF did not enhance IL-1 or TNF production by BAM+conidia, GM-CSF significantly antagonized DEX suppression of IL-1 cytokine production. For comparative purposes, lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 microg/ml) was used to stimulate BAM in experiments similar to the above. In contrast to the findings with conidia, GM-CSF enhanced the production of IL-1 (5-fold) and TNF (1.5-fold) by LPS treated BAM. DEX suppression of cytokine production by BAM+LPS was modestly but significantly antagonized by GM-CSF. Moreover, differences between regulation of IL-1 and TNF production by BAM+conidia or LPS and peritoneal macrophages (PM)+conidia or LPS were documented. Finally, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was minimally produced by BAM + conidia or LPS, but IL-10 was produced by PM + conidia or LPS. In summary, these data indicate that the risk factor for aspergillosis associated with DEX could be lessened in the pulmonary compartment with GM-CSF. On the other hand, desired effects of DEX could be maintained in other compartments.",2002,12200108,no
Glucoamylase: another fungal enzyme associated with baker's asthma.,"Aspergillus-derived enzymes are widely used as dough additives in the baking industry. These enzymes may give rise to immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated sensitization and occupational asthma. Glucoamylase (or amyloglucosidase) is an important industrial enzyme obtained from Aspergillus niger and used to provide fermentable sugars for yeast to improve loaf volume and texture.The aim of our study was to investigate the potential allergenic role of glucoamylase in baker's asthma.We report four subjects with work-related allergic respiratory symptoms who were exposed to glucoamylase and other starch-cleaving enzymes used as baking additives. The causative role of glucoamylase in work-related asthma was investigated by immunologic tests and specific inhalation challenges (SIC). Glucoamylase allergenic components were characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting.Skin prick tests to glucoamylase (10 mg/mL) gave a positive response in all patients. Further, a positive skin prick test to alpha-amylase was obtained in the four patients and to hemicellulase in two of them. SIC to glucoamylase elicited isolated early asthmatic responses in the three patients tested, and SIC to alpha-amylase elicited early asthmatic responses in two patients and a dual asthmatic response in another patient. Immunoblotting with glucoamylase showed several IgE-binding bands with molecular masses between 33 and 96 kD. IgE-inhibition assays showed scarce to moderate allergenic cross-reactivity between glucoamylase and alpha-amylase.These bakers had developed IgE-mediated occupational asthma to glucoamylase and alpha-amylase. Fungal glucoamylase is widely used as a baking additive and this enzyme may give rise to allergic respiratory reactions among exposed workers.",2002,12197578,no
Aflatoxin and fumonisin contamination of commercial corn (Zea mays) hybrids in Mississippi.,"Resistance to mycotoxin contamination was compared in field samples harvested from 45 commercial corn (maize) hybrids and 5 single-cross aflatoxin-resistant germplasm lines in years with high and moderate heat stress. In high heat stress, mycotoxin levels were (4.34 +/- 0.32) x 10(3) microg/kg [(0.95-10.5 x 10(3) microg/kg] aflatoxins and 11.2 +/- 1.2 mg/kg (0-35 mg/kg) fumonisins in commercial hybrids and 370 +/- 88 microg/kg (140-609 microg/kg) aflatoxins and 4.0 +/- 1.3 mg/kg (1.7-7.8 mg/kg) fumonisins in aflatoxin-resistant germplasm lines. Deoxynivalenol was detected (one-fourth of the samples, 0-1.5 mg/kg), but not zearalenone. In moderate heat stress, mycotoxin levels were 6.2 +/- 1.6 microg/kg (0-30.4 microg/kg) aflatoxins and 2.5 +/- 0.2 mg/kg (0.5-4.8 mg/kg) fumonisins in commercial hybrids and 1.6 +/- 0.7 microg/kg (0-7 microg/kg) aflatoxins and 1.2 +/- 0.2 mg/kg (0.5-3.0 mg/kg) fumonisins in aflatoxin-resistant germplasm lines. The results are consistent with heat stress playing an important role in the susceptibility of corn to both aflatoxin and fumonisin contamination, with significant reductions of both aflatoxins and fumonisins in aflatoxin-resistant germplasm lines.",2002,12188638,no
"IgE binding conformational epitopes of Asp f 3, a major allergen of Aspergillus fumigatus.","sp f 3 has been identified as one of the major allergens of Aspergillus fumigatus associated with the sensitization and immune responses in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). In order to understand the structure/function relationship of Asp f 3, we studied synthetic peptides and constructed mutants deleted of specific IgE binding regions. The mutated allergens were obtained by expressing the genes and studied by ELISA for their reactivity with IgE from patients with ABPA. Seven linear IgE binding regions spanning the whole Asp f 3 molecule were demonstrated. The results demonstrated strong binding of IgE from ABPA patients with Asp f 3 and one mutant, Asp f 3(1-150), but not with other mutant constructs. The results identified 12 amino acids at the N-terminal end and 8 amino acids (143-150) at the C-terminal end as significant in the conformational constraints for IgE binding. The Fourier transfer spectra showed comparable beta-sheet structure of Asp f 3(1-150) and Asp f 3, indicating the role of secondary structure in IgE binding. The primary and secondary structures may help understanding of the functional role the allergens play in the disease and may have implications in immunodiagnosis and probably immunotherapy.",2002,12173308,no
"Increased expression of a novel Aspergillus fumigatus ABC transporter gene, atrF, in the presence of itraconazole in an itraconazole resistant clinical isolate.","Aspergillus fumigatus is the most frequent causative agent of invasive aspergillosis. Itraconazole became available in 1990 to treat invasive aspergillosis, but instances of resistance have now been described. Drug efflux was a proposed mechanism in one itraconazole resistant clinical isolate (AF72) which accumulates low levels of the drug. Drug efflux in fungi can be mediated by ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCT) genes, such as CDR1 in Candida albicans. Using a probe derived from CDR1, a gene, atrF, was cloned from A. fumigatus. The atrF gene product (AtrF) is 1547 amino acids long and has characteristic multidrug resistance motifs. Dot blot analysis revealed that AF72 has approximately 5-fold higher levels of atrF mRNA than susceptible isolates AF10 and H06-03 in cultures with sub-minimum inhibitory concentration (sub-MIC) levels of itraconazole. atrF is the first ABCT gene cloned from A. fumigatus, whose overexpression is correlated with itraconazole resistance.",2002,12135575,no
Role of cis prolines 112 and 126 in the functional activity of ribonucleolytic toxin restrictocin.,"Restrictocin is a 149 amino acid ribonucleolytic toxin produced by the fungus Aspergillus, which specifically cleaves a single phosphodiester bond within 28S rRNA resulting in a potent inhibition of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. Restrictocin has 12 prolines out of which three at positions 48, 112, and 126 are cis. Prolines at position 112, 118, and 126 were individually mutated to alanine to investigate their role in the catalytic and membrane interaction activity of restrictocin. All mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli, and recombinant proteins purified to homogeneity. Mutation of P112 resulted in a remarkable 50- and 100-fold reduction, respectively, in the ribonucleolytic and cytotoxic activities of restrictocin, whereas the interaction of P112A with phospholipid membranes increased. Mutants P118A and P126A exhibited 3-5-fold decreased ribonucleolytic and cytotoxic activities, however, their membrane interaction activity was marginally reduced compared to restrictocin. The study demonstrates that P112 is absolutely essential to maintain the functionally active conformation of restrictocin. Also, prolines 112, 118, and 126 do not appear to be directly involved in the membrane interaction activity of restrictocin.",2002,12127966,no
Recent progress in the diagnosis of fungal infections in the immunocompromised host.,"The management of invasive fungal infections has been hampered by the inability to diagnose the infection at an early stage of disease. Although proving the presence of infection by histology and culture remains the cornerstone of the diagnosis, non-culture based methods are becoming available that enable early detection. Molecular diagnosis by PCR appears very promising since fungal DNA can be detected in the blood of infected patients before conventional methods. Furthermore, a broad range of yeasts and molds can be identified to species level. Automation of sample preparation and use of real-time PCR systems will help standardize the procedure and reduce false positive results due to contamination. Promising assays for the detection of fungal antigens in serum have been commercialized, including detection systems for mannan (Candida) and galactomannan (Aspergillus). Circulating antigens can be detected at an early stage of infection, often before the onset of clinical symptoms. Antigen detection is limited to detecting only one genus and not enabling speciation. Furthermore, both PCR and antigen detection can be used to monitor the response of patients to treatment with anti-fungal agents. Although prospective screening of high-risk patients for the presence of circulating markers of fungal infection appears to be an appropriate strategy, studies are needed to help to establish the optimal approach to managing invasive fungal infections that incorporates the benefits of non-culture based methods.",2002,12127859,no
Transfer specificity of detergent-solubilized fenugreek galactomannan galactosyltransferase.,"The current experimental model for galactomannan biosynthesis in membrane-bound enzyme systems from developing legume-seed endosperms involves functional interaction between a GDP-mannose (Man) mannan synthase and a UDP-galactose (Gal) galactosyltransferase. The transfer specificity of the galactosyltransferase to the elongating mannan chain is critical in regulating the distribution and the degree of Gal substitution of the mannan backbone of the primary biosynthetic product. Detergent solubilization of the galactosyltransferase of fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) with retention of activity permitted the partial purification of the enzyme and the cloning and sequencing of the corresponding cDNA with proof of functional identity. We now document the positional specificity of transfer of ((14)C)Gal from UDP-((14)C)Gal to manno-oligosaccharide acceptors, chain lengths 5 to 8, catalyzed by the detergent-solubilized galactosyltransferase. Enzymatic fragmentation analyses of the labeled products showed that a single Gal residue was transferred per acceptor molecule, that the linkage was (1-->6)-alpha, and that there was transfer to alternative Man residues within the acceptor molecules. Analysis of the relative frequencies of transfer to alternative Man residues within acceptor oligosaccharides of different chain length allowed the deduction of the substrate subsite recognition requirement of the galactosyltransferase. The enzyme has a principal recognition sequence of six Man residues, with transfer of Gal to the third Man residue from the nonreducing end of the sequence. These observations are incorporated into a refined model for enzyme interaction in galactomannan biosynthesis.",2002,12114592,no
Functional expression and cellular localization of cercosporin-resistance proteins fused with the GFP in Cercospora nicotianae.,"The Cercospora nicotianae pdx1 and crg1 genes were previously identified as genes required for resistance to the singlet oxygen ((1)O(2))-generating toxin cercosporin. The pdx1 gene has subsequently been shown to be required for pyridoxine biosynthesis, but both the precise biochemical function of the PDX1 protein and the function of the CRG1 protein remain undefined, as both sequences lack defined enzymatic domains or cofactor-binding sites. The gfp gene encoding green fluorescent protein was translationally fused with pdx1 and crg1. Transformation of these constructs into strains mutant in these respective genes resulted in green-fluorescent transformants complemented for the mutant phenotype. Microscopic studies revealed that in transformants transformed with gfp alone, fluorescence was distributed evenly throughout the cytoplasm and excluded from the vacuoles. Expression of PDX1::GFP either under the constitutive Aspergillus nidulans gpdA promoter or its own native promoter was visualized as distinct fluorescent circular structures in the cytoplasm, suggesting that PDX1::GFP was probably localized in the intracellular vesicles. Expression of CRG1 fused with GFP at either its N- or C-terminus resulted in low green fluorescence, compared with that of GFP alone or PDX1::GFP. The green fluorescence of either of the CRG1::GFP fusion proteins was barely observable in transformants and was generally seen as a few scattered regions of fluorescence in the hyphae. Southern blot analysis indicated multiple copies of the constructs were integrated into the fungal genome. Northern analysis revealed that pdx1:: gfp and crg1:: gfp were each expressed as an intact transcriptional unit. Cell fractionation followed by immunoblotting against a GFP antibody showed that GFP alone and PDX1::GFP were detected exclusively in the cytoplasmic fraction. The two CRG1::GFP proteins were barely detected in the cytoplasmic fraction and not at all from the membrane fraction, a result inconsistent with microscopic observation and computer sequence analysis, which suggests that CRG1 is a membrane protein.",2002,12111097,no
Immunoglobulin G antibodies against indoor dampness-related microbes and adult-onset asthma: a population-based incident case-control study.,"Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against microbes related to indoor dampness problems have been used as potential biomarkers of fungal exposure in clinical investigations. There is limited information on their relation to asthma. We conducted a population-based incident case-control study to assess the risk of asthma in relation to specific IgG antibodies to eight dampness-related microbes: Aspergillus fumigatus, A. versicolor, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Fusarium oxysporum, Sporobolomyces salmonicolor, Stachybotrys chartarum, Streptomyces albus and Trichoderma citrinoviride. We recruited systematically all new cases of asthma during a 2.5-year study period and randomly selected controls from a source population of adults 21-63 years of age living in the Pirkanmaa Hospital District, South Finland. The clinically diagnosed case series consisted of 521 adults with newly diagnosed asthma and the control series of 932 controls selected randomly from the source population. IgG antibodies were analysed with ELISA. An increased risk of developing asthma in adulthood was significantly related to IgG antibodies to T. citrinoviride, but not to the other moulds. There was no evidence of a dose-response relation between the IgG antibody level and the risk of asthma. T. citrinoviride may play a role in the aetiology of adult-onset asthma or serve as an indicator of other causal factors.",2002,12100029,no
Fungal fragments as indoor air biocontaminants.,"The aerosolization process of fungal propagules of three species (Aspergillus versicolor, Penicillium melinii, and Cladosporium cladosporioides) was studied by using a newly designed and constructed aerosolization chamber. We discovered that fungal fragments are aerosolized simultaneously with spores from contaminated agar and ceiling tile surfaces. Concentration measurements with an optical particle counter showed that the fragments are released in higher numbers (up to 320 times) than the spores. The release of fungal propagules varied depending on the fungal species, the air velocity above the contaminated surface, and the texture and vibration of the contaminated material. In contrast to spores, the release of fragments from smooth surfaces was not affected by air velocity, indicating a different release mechanism. Correlation analysis showed that the number of released fragments cannot be predicted on the basis of the number of spores. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with monoclonal antibodies produced against Aspergillus and Penicillium fungal species showed that fragments and spores share common antigens, which not only confirmed the fungal origin of the fragments but also established their potential biological relevance. The considerable immunological reactivity, the high number, and the small particle size of the fungal fragments may contribute to human health effects that have been detected in buildings with mold problems but had no scientific explanation until now. This study suggests that future fungal spore investigations in buildings with mold problems should include the quantitation of fungal fragments.",2002,12089037,no
"Molecular and functional characterization of a second copy of the aflatoxin regulatory gene, aflR-2, from Aspergillus parasiticus.","The genes required for the synthesis of aflatoxin (AF) in Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus have been shown to be clustered on a chromosome in these fungi. Transcription of most of these genes is dependent upon the activity of the aflR gene, also present on the gene cluster, which encodes a zinc binuclear cluster DNA-binding protein. While many strains of A. parasiticus have only one copy of aflR (aflR-1), many others contain a second copy of this gene (aflR-2) which resides on a duplicated region of the aflatoxin gene cluster. Targeted disruption of aflR-1 generated a number of non-aflatoxin producing transformants of A. parasiticus SU-1 which still harbored a wild-type aflR-2 gene. Southern and Northern hybridization analyses and ELISA assays demonstrated that aflR-1 had been successfully inactivated in strain AFS10. DNA sequence analysis showed that aflR-2 was capable of encoding a deduced 47 kDa protein. Northern and RT-PCR analysis of RNA from a toxin producing strain indicated that aflR-2 was transcribed at extremely low levels compared to aflR-1. RT-PCR analysis of RNA from AFS10 demonstrated that mRNAs of aflatoxin pathway genes were not processed to their mature forms. Functional analysis of aflr-2 protein in a yeast system showed that it was not activating transcription.",2002,12084578,no
"A novel oxidized low-density lipoprotein-binding protein, Asp-hemolysin, recognizes lysophosphatidylcholine.","Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) plays an important role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Asp-hemolysin, a hemolytic toxin from Aspergillus fumigatus, is a specific, high affinity binding protein for Ox-LDL. We have previously shown that Ox-LDL strongly inhibits the hemolytic activity of Asp-hemolysin, and that the removal of lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) from Ox-LDL abolished the inhibition. In the present study, to clarify the binding mechanism of Asp-hemolysin to Ox-LDL, we investigated the interaction between Asp-hemolysin and lysoPC as a typical lipid moiety of Ox-LDL. Based on western blot analysis, the binding of Asp-hemolysin to LDL, oxidized for different times, depended on the lysoPC content in each Ox-LDL. In addition, the inhibition of lysoPC production in Ox-LDL by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) pretreatment of LDL resulted in a marked decrease of Asp-hemolysin binding to PMSF-pretreated Ox-LDL. Furthermore, the binding analysis of Asp-hemolysin to lysoPC using ion-exchange chromatography revealed that Asp-hemolysin directly binds to lysoPC.",2002,12081148,no
Management of mycoses in patients with hematologic disease and cancer -- review of the literature.,"During the past years, progress has been made in the treatment of patients with cancer, and the proportion of patients achieving a complete remission and longer survival has increased. However, fungal infections have become one the leading factors contributing to morbidity and mortalitiy in patient with heamatological malignancies and solid tumours. Most opportunistic fungal infections are caused by Candida and Aspergillus species, but a growing number of less frequent fungal pathogens has been observed in recent years. The management of patients consist of a multidisciplinary approach combining radiology, new techniques in laboratory diagnostics such as serology and PCR as well as use of a growing armentarium of antifungal agents. Therapy of invasive mycosis no more rely on amphotericin B, but newer antifungal agents such as voriconazole and caspofungin have the potential to substitute the current standard therapy.",2002,12069913,no
Real-time PCR coupled with automated DNA extraction and detection of galactomannan antigen in serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.,"To improve the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA), we developed a LightCycler PCR assay targeted to Aspergillus fumigatus and A. flavus mitochondrial DNA. To avoid contamination, fully automated nucleic acid extraction with the MagNA Pure LC apparatus was used. The linearity of the results was achieved over a 6-log range of input A. fumigatus DNA, from 0.3 ng to 3 fg/10 microl of water. We retrospectively compared the LightCycler PCR and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of galactomannan (GM) in serum from 14 patients with IA. The GM assay was more frequently positive (57 of 109 52%) than the PCR assay (49 of 109",2002,12037092,no
Detection of antibodies specific to an antigenic cell wall galactomannoprotein for serodiagnosis of Aspergillus fumigatus aspergillosis.,"Aspergilloma and invasive aspergillosis are important opportunistic infections caused by Aspergillus species, among which Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common species associated with human disease. We developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based antibody assay with Afmp1p, a purified recombinant antigenic cell wall galactomannoprotein of A. fumigatus. Evaluation of the test with guinea pig sera against A. fumigatus and other pathogenic fungi indicated that this assay was specific for A. fumigatus. Clinical evaluation revealed that the assay was 100% sensitive for patients with aspergilloma and 33.3% sensitive for patients with invasive aspergillosis. No false-positive results were found for serum samples from 80 healthy blood donors, 6 patients with typhoid fever, 4 patients with melioidosis, 20 patients with penicilliosis marneffei, 5 patients with candidiasis, and 4 patients with cryptococcosis, indicating a high specificity of the test. Thus, this ELISA-based test for the detection of anti-Afmp1p antibody can be of significant value as a diagnostic for aspergillosis.",2002,12037061,no
Invasive fungal infections in hematology: new trends.,"Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are among the most feared complications of patients being treated for a hematological malignancy. Currently, most serious IFI occur in patients with acute leukemia and after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Although Candida albicans and Aspergillusspp. continue to be the main pathogens, the proportion of patients infected by non-albicans species of Candida and other yeasts and by other filamentous fungi is rising in most institutions. Risk factors for the various IFI differ, and it is thus of utmost importance to realize that not all patients are the same with respect to the risk for developing the various IFI. Recent advances in diagnosis now allow the use of very sensitive imaging techniques with an extremely low negative predictive value. Among the novel microbiologic methods, the galactomannan antigen test is now commercially available for routine use in the diagnosis of aspergillosis, while DNA fungal detection is still experimental. For the first time, clinicians now have a broad range of antifungals to chose from, with special emphasis on amphotericin B preparations, novel broad-spectrum azoles, and the echinocandins. However, the exact place of these agents in treating different IFI will need to be found in the near future.",2002,12029531,no
Chronic sino-naso-orbital fungal infection due to Pseudallescheria boydii in a nonimmunocompromised host--a case report.,"A case of recurrent sino-naso-orbital fungal infection due to Pseudallescheria boydii described in a 28 yrs. old man, who appeared immunocompetent, and was found negative for HIV I and II by ELISA tested on two occasions. The fungal culture was negative. It is very essential to identify P boydii as Miconazole is the only antifungal drug of choice for this fungus. The pathologist plays an important role in identifying this fungus when fungal culture fails to yield the growth. The pathologist has to look for clinching clues such as ""intercalary conidia"" and ""chlamydoconidia"" to distinguish P boydii from Aspergillus.",2002,12024935,no
Comparative antifungal activities and plasma pharmacokinetics of micafungin (FK463) against disseminated candidiasis and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in persistently neutropenic rabbits.,"Micafungin (FK463) is an echinocandin that demonstrates potent in vitro antifungal activities against Candida and Aspergillus species. However, little is known about its comparative antifungal activities in persistently neutropenic hosts. We therefore investigated the plasma micafungin pharmacokinetics and antifungal activities of micafungin against experimental disseminated candidiasis and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in persistently neutropenic rabbits. The groups with disseminated candidiasis studied consisted of untreated controls (UCs) rabbits treated with desoxycholate amphotericin B (DAMB) at 1 mg/kg of body weight/day",2002,12019101,no
Development of an indirect ELISA for the detection of serum antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus in captive penguins.,"Aspergillosis is a significant cause of mortality in captive penguins (Sphenisciformes). An indirect ELISA for the detection of Aspergillus fumigatus-specific immunoglobulin in penguins was developed and standardised by making use of a family-specific antiserum (anti-Aptenodyptes patagonica patagonicus). The results were calculated quantitatively as ELISA units, derived by polynomial regression analysis, and semi-quantitatively as end titres. Serum samples from 61 captive penguins were tested with the assay, and the results were compared with those obtained by counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE). The ELISA results correlated with the CIE results only when end titres were reported (R(s) = -0.676, P < 0.002). Fifty-seven of the penguins (93 per cent) were seropositive, but the detection of immunoglobulin did not correlate with clinical disease. At Whipsnade Wild Animal Park, Humboldt's penguins (Spheniscus humboldti) demonstrated higher seropositivity than king penguins (Aptenodyptes patagonicapatagonicus) (P = 0.022), but Humboldt's penguins at Fota Wildlife Park had a significantly higher seropositivity than Humboldt's penguins at Whipsnade (P = 0.035).",2002,12017526,no
"Pleurotus and Agrocybe hemolysins, new proteins hypothetically involved in fungal fruiting.","Novel hemolytic proteins, ostreolysin and aegerolysin, were purified from the fruiting bodies of the edible mushrooms Pleurotus ostreatus and Agrocybe aegerita. Both ostreolysin and aegerolysin have a molecular weight of about 16 kDa, have low isoelectric points of 5.0 and 4.85, are thermolabile, and hemolytic to bovine erythrocytes at nanomolar concentrations. Their activity is impaired by micromolar Hg(2+) but not by membrane lipids and serum low-density lipoproteins (LDL). The sequence of respectively 50 and 10 N-terminal amino acid residues of ostreolysin and aegerolysin has been determined and found to be highly identical with a cDNA-derived amino acid sequence of putative Aa-Pri1 protein from the mushroom A. aegerita, Asp-hemolysin from Aspergillus fumigatus, and two bacterial hemolysin-like proteins expressed during sporulation. We found that ostreolysin is expressed during formation of primordia and fruiting bodies, which is in accord with previous finding that the Aa-Pri1 gene is specifically expressed during fruiting initiation. It is suggestive that the isolated hemolysins play an important role in initial phase of fungal fruiting.",2002,12020804,no
Aspergillus antigen and PCR assays in bone marrow transplanted children.,"Screening for Aspergillus antigen and DNA has been introduced for the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in adults, but data in children at risk are scarce. Seventeen 1-108 month-old children were screened for Aspergillus antigenaemia by a commercial assay before and after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Seventy-one serum samples were examined retrospectively by a novel nested PCR assay. Results of both assays were correlated with clinical, radiological and microbiological findings used for the definition of invasive aspergillosis by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). Three cases of probable or possible IA were defined, and in 14 children invasive aspergillosis was ruled out. In 10 children, Aspergillus antigen was detected in at least two consecutive serum samples, a microbiological EORTC criteria of IA. Specific DNA was detected in 8 antigen-positive and 2 antigen-negative sera. A positive predictive value of 20% was calculated for both assays. Hence, a high rate of positive results of antigen Elisa and PCR assays in BMT children are due to transient antigenaemia and fungaemia without clinical relevance. According to our data, prospective studies in well defined pediatric patients are urgently needed to determine the value of serial Aspergillus PCR assays for the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in children at risk.",2002,12010653,yes
Development of a fluorescence polarization assay for the determination of aflatoxins in grains.,"Aflatoxins produced by Aspergillus flavus are commonly found in human and animal foods including grains, cereals, peanut products, sorghum, and soy seeds. Exposure to aflatoxins has been associated with carcinogenicity. This paper reports a simple, portable, and rapid fluorescence polarization (FP) assay for aflatoxin determination in grains. This immunoassay is field portable, homogeneous, and without any washing and cleaning steps. The assay is based upon the competition between free aflatoxin and an aflatoxin-fluorescein tracer for an aflatoxin-specific monoclonal antibody in solution. A series of naturally contaminated corn, sorghum, peanut butter, and peanut paste samples were analyzed by FP and compared with HPLC results. Similarly, spiked popcorn samples were analyzed by FP. FP results of naturally contaminated samples correlated well with HPLC (r (2) = 0.97). FP analysis of spiked popcorn samples (with a mixture of B(1)/B(2)/G(1)/G(2), 7/1/3/1, w/w) gave a good correlation with spiked values (r (2) = 0.99). However, FP consistently underestimated the aflatoxin contents. This was perhaps due to low cross-reactivity of the antibody used toward B(2), G(1), and G(2) aflatoxins. These results combined with the portability and simplicity of the assay suggest that the assay can be used for screening total aflatoxin in grains.",2002,12009972,no
The distinctiveness of ATP:citrate lyase from Aspergillus nidulans.,"ATP:citrate lyase (ACL), an important enzyme in lipid synthesis, has been purified from Aspergillus nidulans to a specific activity of 19.6 micromol min(-1) mg(-1), almost twice that of any other purified ACL and shown to be distinct from any previously purified ACL. The enzyme is a 371+/-31 kDa hexamer of 3 alpha, 3 beta proteins, unlike the 4 alpha tetramer found in rats or yeasts. The molecular weights of the alpha and beta protein subunits were determined by SDS-PAGE to be 70 and 55 kDa. ACL in A. nidulans (unlike Aspergillus niger) appears to be regulated by the carbon source present in the media. In crude extracts, it was found at high activity (88 micromol min(-1) mg protein(-1)) in glucose-grown cells but only at low activity (10 micromol min(-1) mg protein(-1)) in acetate-grown cells.",2002,12009400,no
Enhanced antifungal efficacy in experimental invasive pulmonary aspergillosis by combination of AmBisome with Fungizone as assessed by several parameters of antifungal response.,"In common with a proportion of patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), the efficacy of AmBisome treatment regimens in our rat model remains suboptimal. To investigate whether this might be the result of initially low antifungal activity of amphotericin B at the site of infection when administered in the liposomal form, Fungizone was added to AmBisome at the start of treatment. Groups of granulocytopenic rats with left-sided IPA received 10 day treatment regimens with either AmBisome 10 mg/kg/day (n = 25) or AmBisome 10 mg/kg/day combined with a single dose of Fungizone 1 mg/kg at day 1 (n = 27). Parameters of treatment response included survival, serum galactomannan (GM), size and quality of pulmonary macroscopic lesions, lung weight, viable fungal counts (cfu) and chitin content of the infected lung, and extra-pulmonary disseminated fungal infection. In a separate experiment the significance of early start of treatment to obtain therapeutic efficacy was investigated. Compared with untreated controls, both treatment regimens showed a significant increase in survival and change in parameters of fungal infection except left lung cfu. The combination treatment showed a significant increase in survival compared with AmBisome monotherapy (P = 0.02) and a significant decrease in left lung chitin content (P = 0.03). Differences in circulating GM concentrations between the two treatment regimes approached significance (P = 0.06). Delay in the start of treatment from 16 to 24 h after fungal inoculation resulted in a significant decrease in therapeutic efficacy (P = 0.02). It is concluded that the efficacy of AmBisome therapy can be enhanced by the addition of Fungizone at the start of treatment. This is probably a result of active amphotericin B being immediately available in the lung at the start of treatment.",2002,12003976,no
"A thaumatin-like gene in nonclimacteric pepper fruits used as molecular marker in probing disease resistance, ripening, and sugar accumulation.","During pepper (Capsicum annuum) fruit ripening, the ripe fruit interaction with the anthracnose fungus, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, is generally incompatible. However, the unripe fruit can interact compatibly with the fungus. A gene, designated PepTLP (for pepper thaumatin-like protein), was isolated and characterized by using mRNA differential display. The PepTLP gene encodes a protein homologous to other thaumatin-like proteins and contains 16 conserved cysteine residues and the consensus pattern of thaumatin. PepTLP gene expression is developmentally regulated during ripening. The accumulation of PepTLP mRNA and PepTLP protein in the incompatible interaction was higher than that in the compatible one. Furthermore, PepTLP gene expression was stimulated by both jasmonic acid treatment and wounding during ripening, but by wounding only in the unripe fruit. Immunolocalization studies showed that it is localized to the intercellular spaces among cortical cells. The expression of the PepTLP gene upon fungal infection was a rise from the early-breaker fruit. The development of anthracnose became significantly prevented with beginning of fruit ripening, and the sum total of sugar accumulation increased. The results suggest that the PepTLP gene can be used as a molecular marker in probing for disease resistance, ripening, and sugar accumulation in nonclimacteric pepper fruits.",2002,11999369,no
Carbohydrates expressed on Aspergillus fumigatus induce in vivo allergic Th2-type response.,"The mould Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) causes several forms of Th2-biased diseases such as Type I respiratory allergies. This mould contains abundant carbohydrates including glucan, chitin and galactomannan. However, little is known on whether these carbohydrates directly drive Th2 responses in vivo.We sought to determine the relative role of carbohydrates expressed on crude extracts of Af in the induction of Th2-type antibody production and local eosinophila in mice.Carbohydrates on native Af were destroyed by sodium metaperiodate under mild conditions. CBA/J mice were sensitized intranasally with native, periodate-treated or mock-treated Af. Histologic changes and production of Af-specific IgE, IgG1 and IgG2a, as well as serum total IgE were determined. Inhibition ELISA for Af-specific IgE was performed using periodate-treated Af as an inhibitor.Mice sensitized with periodate-treated Af displayed significant decreases in both total and specific IgE levels in comparison to mice sensitized with native or mock-treated Af. Furthermore, sensitization and subsequent challenge with periodate-treated Af significantly reduced the degree of eosinophil recruitment into the nasal mucosa, compared to the controls. On the other hand, competitive inhibition showed that periodate-treated Af could inhibit binding between native Af and specific IgE in a similar manner to that of native and mock-treated Af.These results suggest that carbohydrates on Af play a key role as internal adjuvants in inducing the allergic Th2-type response and are not the targets of the induced IgE response.",2002,11994105,no
Immunoglobulin G antibodies to moulds in school-children from moisture problem schools.,"The purpose of the present study was to evaluate mould-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in children exposed to moisture and mould problems in their school, and the association between IgG antibodies and mould allergy, active or passive smoking and respiratory symptoms.IgG antibodies were studied to 24 moulds in 93 children from three moisture problem schools and in 33 children from a reference school. The antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared to positive adult sera.There were no significant differences in mould-specific IgG concentrations between exposed and non-exposed school-children. Antibodies to moulds common in moisture damaged buildings were associated with allergic diseases, as well as with mould-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) or skin prick test (SPT) findings. Aspergillus fumigatus and A. versicolor were the moulds with the most consistent findings. Active and passive smoking were associated with low levels of antibodies to many moulds. Though the association between asthma, wheezing or cough symptoms, and IgG to moulds was not significant, 7 (39%) of the 18 children with multiple (> 7) elevated IgG findings suffered from asthma or wheezing.Allergy was, but asthma was not, associated with IgG antibodies to the moulds that can be found in moisture damaged buildings. However, no association was found between IgG antibodies to moulds and exposure to moisture and moulds in school.",2002,11991303,no
Impairment of cell cycle progression by aflatoxin B1 in human cell lines.,"Aflatoxin B1 is a mycotoxin produced by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticum, which may be present as a food contaminant. It is known to cause acute toxic effects and act as a carcinogenic agent. The carcinogenic action has been related to its ability to form unstable adducts with DNA, which represent possible mutagenic sites. On the other hand, the primary cellular target responsible for its toxic action has not yet been clearly identified. Previous data suggested a possible correlation between cell proliferation and responsiveness to aflatoxin toxicity. These observations led us to investigate the effect of the toxin on cell cycle progression of three human cell lines (HepG2, SK-N-MC and SK-N-SH derived from liver and nervous tissue tumours) they were shown to display different responses to toxin exposure and have different growth kinetics. We performed analysis of the cell cycle, DNA synthesis and expression of p21 and p53 in the presence and absence of the toxin in all cell lines exposed. The results of cell cycle cytofluorometric analysis show significant alterations of cell cycle progression as a result of toxin treatment. In all cell lines exposure to a 24 h toxin treatment causes a dose-dependent accumulation in S phase, however, the ability to recover from impairment to traverse S phase varies in the cell lines under study. SK-N-MC cells appear more prone to resume DNA synthesis when the toxin is removed, while the other two cell lines maintain a significant inhibition of DNA synthesis, as indicated by cytofluorimetry and [(3)H]dTR incorporation. The level of p53 and p21 expression in the three cell lines was examined by western blot analysis and significant differences were detected. The ready resumption of DNA synthesis displayed by SK-N-MC cells could possibly be related to the absence of p53 control of cell cycle progression.",2002,11971996,no
Follow-up of anti-Aspergillus IgG and IgA antibodies in bone marrow transplanted patients with invasive aspergillosis.,"A total of 89 patients at risk for, or with invasive aspergillosis (IA) were recruited from bone marrow transplantation (BMT) units in two Lisbon hospitals, and followed for 2(1/2) years to monitor their immune response. Of these patients, six developed probable IA, from which five died. The presence of serum IgG or IgA antibodies against seven Aspergillus recombinant antigens was assessed in patients with IA, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In parallel, the serum levels of galactomannan (GM) were also monitored, using the Platelia Aspergillus kit (Sanofi Pasteur, Marnes-la-Coquette, France). Superoxide dismutase (Sod) and 94 kDa were the most immunogenic antigens for IgA, while the IgG pattern of recognition changed from patient to patient. From our results we conclude that although follow-up of antibodies against these antigens should not be used as a diagnostic method, patients with IA do produce an immune response that may influence disease outcome.",2002,11968054,no
Fusarium infections of the skin.,"Fusarium species are ubiquitous and may be found in the soil, air and on plants. Fusarium species can cause mycotoxicosis in humans following ingestion of food that has been colonized by the fungal organism. In humans, Fusarium species can also cause disease that is localized, focally invasive or disseminated. The pathogen generally affects immunocompromised individuals with infection of immunocompetent persons being rarely reported. Localized infection includes septic arthritis, endophthalmitis, osteomyelitis, cystitis and brain abscess. In these situations relatively good response may be expected following appropriate surgery and oral antifungal therapy. Disseminated infection occurs when two or more noncontiguous sites are involved. Over eighty cases have been reported, many of which had a hematologic malignancy including neutropenia. The species most commonly involved include Fusarium solani, Fusarium oxysporum, and Fusarium moniliforme (also termed F. verticillioides). The diagnosis of Fusarium infection may be made on histopathology, gram stain, mycology, blood culture, or serology. Portals of entry of disseminated infection include the respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract, and cutaneous sites.The skin can be an important and an early clue to diagnosis since cutaneous lesions may be observed at an early stage of the disease and in about seventy-five cases of disseminated Fusarium infection. Typical skin lesions may be painful red or violaceous nodules, the center of which often becomes ulcerated and covered by a black eschar. The multiple necrotizing lesions are often observed on the trunk and the extremities. Onychomycosis most commonly due to F. oxysporum or F. solani has been reported. The onychomycosis may be of several types: distal and lateral subungual (DLSO), white superficial (WSO), and proximal subungual (PSO). In proximal subungual onychomycosis there may be associated leukonychia and/or periungual inflammation. Patients with Fusarium onychomycosis have been cured following therapy with itraconazole, terbinafine, ciclopirox olamine lacquer, or topical antifungal agent. In other instances nail avulsion plus antifungal therapy has been successful. In patients with hematologic malignancy or bone marrow transplant, who may experience prolonged or severe neutropenia during the course of therapy, the skin and nails should be carefully examined and consideration given to treating potential infection sites that may serve as portals for systemic dissemination. When disseminated Fusarium infection is present therapy with antifungal agents has generally been disappointing with the chances of a successful resolution being enhanced if the neutropenia can be corrected in a timely manner.",2002,11964778,no
False-positive results caused by cotton swabs in commercial Aspergillus antigen latex agglutination test.,"While testing for Aspergillus spp. using a commercially available latex agglutination test on a brain biopsy wrapped in a cotton swab, false-positive results were obtained.

Intracutaneous tests with recombinant allergens in cystic fibrosis patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and Aspergillus allergy.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), an intensive inflammatory reaction to Aspergillus fumigatus, can cause irreversible lung damage in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The aim of this study was to assess if intracutaneous testing with recombinant A. fumigatus allergens (rAsp f ) allowed a reliable diagnosis of ABPA. Fifty patients with CF were tested, 12 suffering from ABPA, 21 with allergy to A. fumigatus, and 17 CF control patients not sensitized to A. fumigatus. All patients with ABPA reacted to at least one of the two intracellular A. fumigatus allergens rAsp f 4, a 30-kD protein of unknown biologic function, and rAsp f 6, a 23-kD manganese superoxide dismutase, at a concentration of 10(-2) microg/ml. The intracutaneous tests were negative or only marginally positive in the patients with allergy to A. fumigatus and completely negative in the CF control patients. The differential responses to the recombinant A. fumigatus allergens were in perfect agreement with our previous serologic results, so that rAsp f 4 and rAsp f 6 can be considered specific markers for ABPA. Early diagnosis of the disease might help to prevent irreversible lung damage and minimize possible steroid-mediated side effects as a consequence of an optimized control of the disease.",2002,11934714,no
Polymerase chain reaction detection of aspergillus DNA in experimental models of invasive aspergillosis.,"To determine the sensitivity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis, results of quantitative culture, PCR-ELISA, and a quantitative LightCycler assay (Roche Diagnostics) of blood and organ specimens of experimentally infected mice and rabbits were compared. By PCR-ELISA, 297 of 379 murine lung specimens were positive, but only 235 of 379 were culture positive. Whereas 64 culture-negative lungs were positive by PCR, Aspergillus was grown from only 2 PCR-negative samples. The PCR assay was 19.4 times more sensitive than culture. None of the 68 blood cultures from mice and rabbits were positive for Aspergillus fumigatus, whereas PCR detected Aspergillus DNA in 17 of 68 blood samples. Quantitative PCR analysis of blood samples showed a fungus load of 10(1)-10(2) cfu/mL of blood. The data confirm the superior sensitivity of PCR for the diagnosis of experimental Aspergillus infections.",2002,11930335,no
[Non-aggressive diagnostic approach to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in a hematology unit. Retrospective analysis of a series of 16 cases].,"Among neutropenic patients, diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is difficult. Computed tomographic scan, bronchoalveolar lavage and histology are considered invasive procedures, because they represent an infectious risk for these immunocompromised patients.We describe the clinical and noninvasive paraclinical (X-rays, serology) signs of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, from a retrospective study of 16 cases in a haematology unit.Outside of fever and chills, cough and polypnea are the earliest signs, followed by chest pain, dyspnea, lung auscultation changes, and haemoptysis. The sensitivity of each sign is higher than 56%. Before the onset of lung auscultation changes, the chest X-ray shows mainly unilateral alveolar infiltrates. Sensitivity of serology is weak (25%), but contributed to early diagnosis in 16.6% of cases.A better knowledge of the invasive pulmonary aspergillosis clinical, radiological and serological signs could help the practician to prescribe an 'invasive' investigation (computed tomographic scan, bronchoalveolar lavage) to confirm the diagnosis of this fungal infection.",2002,11928373,no
Novel assays and sensor platforms for the detection of aflatoxins.,"The importance of the aflatoxins from food safety and economic standpoints has continued to drive the development of new analytical methods for these mycotoxins. Currently the widely used methods for measurement of aflatoxins fall into two groups, the established chromatographic methods and traditional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Recently substantial progress has been made in the application of new technologies to the monitoring of aflatoxins. In particular, several research groups have developed biosensors for detection ofthe toxins as well as presumptive tests for fungal infection. Biosensors have been developed in a variety of formats including surface plasmon resonance, fiber optic probes, and microbead-based assays. The sensitivity and selectivity of the biosensors and of the presumptive tests has reached the level the where the application of these techniques to the screening of foods warrants further investigation.",2002,11922101,no
Methods of analysis for ochratoxin A.,"The mycotoxin ochratoxin A (OTA) is produced by the fungi Aspergillus alutaceus and Penicillium verrucosum and has carcinogenic, nephrotoxic, teratogenic and immunosuppressive properties. The levels of OTA in foodstuffs are regulated in several countries, so reliable and sensitive methods are necessary for its determination. Procedures for extraction of OTA from ground foods generally use an organic solvent in the presence of acid or an extraction solvent containing aqueous sodium bicarbonate. Cleanup procedures include partition into aqueous sodium bicarbonate, solid phase extraction (SPE) columns and immunoaffinity chromatography. The latter technique allows detection of sub-ppb levels of OTA in a wide variety of foods and in plasma. The most widely used determinative procedure is reversed phase liquid chromatography (LC) with detection by fluorescence (excitation 330-340 nm, emission 460-470 nm) or, more recently, by tandem mass spectrometry. ELISA methods are also available. Certified reference materials containing OTA have been prepared.",2002,11922081,no
Recent advances in analytical methodology for cyclopiazonic acid.,"Cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) is a toxic indole tetramic acid that has been isolated from numerous species of Aspergillus and Penicillium. It has been found as a natural contaminant of cheese, corn, peanuts and various feedstuffs. Historically, thin-layer chromatography has been the most widely used method for quantitative determination of CPA in fungal cultures and agricultural commodities. Several liquid chromatographic (LC) and spectrophotometric methods have also been used, but these require extensive, time-consuming cleanup procedures to achieve accurate quantitation. More recently, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) have been developed for quantification of CPA, and an immunoaffinity column (IAC) has been developed for cleanup of sample extracts prior to quantification by ELISA or LC. In applying the IAC to the cleanup of peanut extracts, recovery of CPA from spiked samples ranged from 83.7% to 90.8%, and the method was successfully applied to the analysis of peanuts that were naturally contaminated with CPA.",2002,11922080,no
Aspergillus galactomannan antigen in the cerebrospinal fluid of bone marrow transplant recipients with probable cerebral aspergillosis.,"The Aspergillus galactomannan test was performed on cerebrospinal fluid and serum samples from 5 patients with probable cerebral aspergillosis and from 16 control patients. Cerebrospinal fluid galactomannan levels were significantly higher in aspergillosis patients, and most galactomannan was produced intrathecally. Comparison of serum galactomannan values in pulmonary and cerebral aspergillosis patients showed significant overlapping. Detection of Aspergillus galactomannan in cerebrospinal fluid may be diagnostic of cerebral aspergillosis.",2002,11923380,no
Surveillance of Aspergillus galactomannan antigenemia for invasive aspergillosis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in neutropenic patients treated for hematological malignancies.,"The incidence of invasive fungal infections is increasing in patients with hematological malignancies. Invasive aspergillosis is one of the most frequently encountered infections with a high mortality rate. New diagnostic tests for invasive aspergillosis such as the detection of Aspergillus galactomannan antigen by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have recently been described. The objective of this study was to evaluate this assay as a potential surrogate for invasive procedures used to diagnose IA.We analyzed the performance of a commercially available ELISA test which we routinely use for the surveillance of galactomannan antigenemia in patients with hematological malignancies experiencing chemotherapy-induced prolonged neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm(3) for more than 7 days). Serum samples were collected on a weekly basis. Test positivity was defined in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.Over the 2 year study period, we analyzed 507 samples obtained during 193 neutropenic episodes from 135 patients. Ten, six and two patients were considered to have proven, probable or possible invasive aspergillosis, respectively, based on clinical, radiological or microbiological data. Forty-four positive (Index>1.5) and 26 'undetermined' (1.5 > Index > 1.0) test results were observed in 17 and ten patients respectively. All invasive aspergillosis cases had at least a positive or an undetermined test result. Only one positive and one undetermined result were found in two patients before the onset of clinical or radiological signs suggesting invasive aspergillosis. Sensitivity was 69% and specificity 96% if only positive results are considered when 'undetermined' test results were combined with positive results, sensitivity attained 100% and specificity 92% suggesting that the cutoff value for positivity can be lowered from 1.5 to 1.0.Although the ELISA test did not appear to play a role in the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis and in the anticipation of antifungal therapy in our experience, it clarifies the diagnosis of infection in probable or possible invasive aspergillosis especially when the cutoff value is lowered and is useful for monitoring patients receiving specific therapy.",2002,11920178,yes
Aspergillus galactomannan detection in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in cancer patients.,"To assess the Aspergillus galactomannan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in adult and pediatric oncohematologic patients.The study was conducted in four patient groups: those with fever of unknown origin (FUO) during neutropenia, suspected pulmonary infection (PI), or nonpulmonary aspergillosis (NPA) and those undergoing surveillance (S) after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). IA was classified as definite, probable, or possible, according to European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycosis Study Group definitions.A total of 3,294 serum samples were collected during 797 episodes (FUO, 261 PI, 297Galactomannan ELISA seems less sensitive than previously described, and sensitivity can be further reduced by the presence of anti-Aspergillus antibodies. A new cutoff value for the ELISA of 0.700 is proposed for non-allo-HSCT adults.",2002,11919250,yes
Development and evaluation of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the serodiagnosis of pythiosis in dogs.,"Pythiosis (caused by the aquatic oomycete Pythium insidiosum) is a devastating and often fatal cause of either severe transmural gastroenteritis or locally invasive subcutaneous disease in dogs living in the southeastern United States. Although early diagnosis is essential for successful treatment, tools available for this task are limited. Therefore, we developed and evaluated an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of anti-P insidiosum antibodies in canine serum. A soluble mycelial extract of P insidiosum was utilized as antigen in the ELISA, which was used to evaluate serum from 43 dogs with pythiosis, 8 dogs with lagenidiosis (another canine oomycosis), 16 dogs with nonoomycotic fungal or algal infections, 22 dogs with nonfungal gastrointestinal or skin disease, and 55 healthy dogs. Results were expressed as percent positivity (PP) relative to a strong positive control serum run on each plate. Medians and ranges for each of the 5 groups were as follows: pythiosis (81.7%, 50.6-98.5%), lagenidiosis (17.3%, 11.3-29.2%), other fungal or algal infections (8.2%, 4.7-15.4%), nonfungal gastrointestinal or skin disease (6.2%, 3.9-20.7%), and healthy dogs (6.7%, 3.0-15.2%). When using a cutoff value of 40% PP, the sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA both were 100%. In addition, ELISA values measured after successful surgical therapy in 2 dogs showed a decrease of anti-P insidiosum antibody concentrations into the normal range as early as 2 months after treatment. We conclude that the ELISA is a sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of canine pythiosis, and may be a useful tool for monitoring response to medical or surgical therapy.",2002,11899028,no
Prevalence of allergen-specific IgE among patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.,"The prevalence of atopy among patients having chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) has been reported to be as high as 80% in published surveys of patients with this syndrome. However, many of the reports relied on self-assessment by patients for the presence of atopy or solely used total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels to assess the likelihood of atopy. To more critically assess the presence of atopy among patients with CFS, testing was done for total IgE and allergen-specific IgE using the Pharmacia CAP system including 20 common allergens: trees (birch/oak/ash), grass (rye/blue), weeds (common/giant ragweed), molds (Penicillium/Aspergillus/Alternaria), dust mites (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus/Dermatophagoides farinae), animal dander (cat/dog), and foods (egg white/milk/wheat/corn/peanut/shrimp). Testing of 50 patients having documented CFS indicated that 78% had total IgE < 100 IU/mL, among whom 26% had a positive test for allergen-specific IgE of class I or greater for one or more allergens. Among the 22% of CFS patients having a total IgE > 100 IU/mL, 73% had a positive test for allergen-specific IgE for one or more allergens. The most commonly positive allergens were dust mites (24-26%), whereas molds (0-6%) and foods (0-4%) were rarely positive. The overall frequency of positive results for the presence of allergen-specific IgE among CFS patients was 36%, not significantly different from the normal prevalence of these antibodies in the general population (20-35%). This assessment of the prevalence of allergen-specific IgE antibodies in patients with CFS fails to support a potential association between CFS and atopy.",2002,11894732,no
"cDNA cloning, biological and immunological characterization of the alkaline serine protease major allergen from Penicillium chrysogenum.","Penicillium chrysogenum (Penicillium notatum) is a prevalent airborne Penicillium species. A 34-kD major IgE-reacting component from P. chrysogenum has been identified as an alkaline serine protease (Pen ch 13, also known as Pen n 13 before) by immunoblot and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis.In the present study, Pen ch 13 was further characterized in terms of cDNA cloning, protein purification, enzymatic activity, histamine release and IgE cross-reactivity with alkaline serine protease allergens from two other prevalent fungal species--P. citrinum (Pen c 13) and Aspergillus flavus (Asp fl 13).A 1,478-bp cDNA (Pen ch 13) that encodes a 398-amino-acid alkaline serine protease from P. chrysogenum was isolated. This fungal protease has pre- and pro-enzyme sequences. The previously determined N-terminal amino acid sequence of the P. chrysogenum 34-kD major allergen is identical to that of residues 116-125 of the cDNA. Starting from Ala116, the deduced amino acid sequence (283 residues) of the mature alkaline serine protease has a calculated molecular mass of 28.105 kD with two cysteines and two putative N-glycosylation sites. It has 83 and 49% sequence identity with the alkaline serine proteases from P. citrinum and A. fumigatus, respectively. The recombinant Pen ch 13 was recovered from inclusion bodies and isolated under denaturing condition. This recombinant protein reacted with IgE antibodies in serum from an asthmatic patient and with monoclonal antibodies (PCM8, PCM10, PCM39) that reacted with the 34-kD component from P. chrysogenum. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified native Pen ch 13 is identical to that determined previously for the 34-kD major allergen in crude P. chrysogenum extracts. The purified native Pen ch 13 has proteolytic activity with casein as the substrate at pH 8.0. This enzymatic activity was inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or diethylpyrocarbonate. Pen ch 13 was also able to degrade gelatin and collagen but not elastin. Basophils from 5 asthmatic patients released histamine (12-73%) when exposed to the purified Pen ch 13. In ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) experiments, IgE for Pen ch 13 was able to compete with purified Pen ch 13, Pen c 13 or Asp fl 13 in a dose-related manner.These results demonstrated that the 34-kD major allergen of P. chrysogenum is an alkaline serine protease. These results also indicated that atopic patients primarily sensitized by either of these prevalent fungal species may develop allergic symptoms by exposure to other environmental fungi due to cross-reacting IgE antibodies against this protease.",2002,11893850,no
Serologic IgE immune responses against Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans in patients with cystic fibrosis.,"The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans in the sputa of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), to assess serologic IgE responses of these patients to the presence of fungi in the sputum, to evaluate what effect this may have on clinical status, and to determine how the above-mentioned factors relate to allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA).Seventy-six CF patients (40 male and 36 female patients age, 15.3 plus minus 8.7 years [mean plus minus SD]) were studied.A total of 1,239 sputum samples from 66 patients were cultured for fungi. A fumigatus was grown in 256 sputum specimens (20.7%), and C albicans was grown in 588 sputum samples (47.5%). Forty patients (60.6%) had at least one positive culture finding for A fumigatus, and 58 patients (87.9%) had at least one positive culture finding for C albicans. Forty-nine patients (64.5%) were sensitized to A fumigatus, and 20 patients (26.7%) were sensitized to C albicans. No correlation was found between the finding of A fumigatus in sputum and IgE to A fumigatus. Only patients who had at least one positive culture finding for C albicans had IgE to C albicans develop. Lung function values and chest radiograph scores were not significantly lower in patients sensitized to either A fumigatus or C albicans as compared to nonsensitized patients. Of the 20 patients sensitized to C albicans, 10 patients had confirmed ABPA and 10 patients had some immunologic characteristics of ABPA.A high prevalence of colonization and sensitization to A fumigatus and C albicans in CF patients was observed. The sensitization to these fungi was not related to the clinical severity. IgE to C albicans may be an immunologic marker related to the development of ABPA in patients with CF.",2002,11888960,no
Clinical evaluation of a polymerase chain reaction assay to detect Aspergillus species in bronchoalveolar lavage samples of neutropenic patients.,"The increasing incidence of invasive aspergillosis, a life-threatening infection in immunocompromised patients, emphasizes the need to improve the currently limited diagnostic tools. Using a recently developed two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect 10 fg of Aspergillus DNA, corresponding to 1-5 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml of spiked samples in vitro, we prospectively examined 197 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from 176 subjects, including 141 neutropenic, febrile patients with lung infiltrates, at risk for invasive fungal disease. Underlying diseases of these patients were haematological malignancies 93 patients suffered from acute leukaemias. Thirty-one of these immunocompromised patients (17.6%) were PCR positive, correlating with positive BAL culture, positive histology from lung surgery or from autopsy, positive computerized tomography scans or positive galactomannan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Six patients (4.3%) of this group had positive PCR results without any correlation to clinical or other diagnostic data, probably owing to contamination of the samples by ubiquitous Aspergillus spores. The samples of two patients (1.4%) with a subsequent histologically proven mould infection were PCR negative. All 102 immunocompromised patients (72.3%) with a negative PCR showed no evidence of invasive fungal disease. From 35 patients without immunodeficiency, four (11.4%) showed positive results, without evidence of invasive or non-invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. In this haematological population, the sensitivity and specificity values of the test reached 93.9% and 94.4%, the positive predictive value 83.8%, the negative predictive value 98.1%. Our data support the considerable clinical value of this PCR assay for confirming and improving diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis in high-risk patients.",2002,11886384,no
Hepatotoxicity related to itraconazole: report of three cases.,"The antimycotic synthetic azole compounds are known to lead to toxic liver injury. The occurrence of acute hepatitis is best known for ketoconazole. With itraconazole, hepatotoxic reactions have only very rarely been reported, and histologic data are lacking. We report on three patients who developed acute liver damage during therapy with itraconazole, and in whom liver biopsy specimens were obtained.Three patients with apparent itraconazole-induced liver injury were studied. Clinical, laboratory, serologic, and histologic data of all three cases were analyzed.All three patients developed a biochemical-histologic pattern of cholestatic liver injury with damage to the interlobular bile ducts. Beginning ductopenia was present in two, suggesting that itraconazole might be responsible for the occurrence of prolonged drug-induced cholangiopathy. Jaundice was the presenting symptom in all three. It was not accompanied by clinical hallmarks of hypersensitivity, which is suggestive for metabolic rather than for immunoallergic idiosyncrasy.Itraconazole-induced liver injury presents with a cholestatic pattern of injury with damage to the interlobular bile ducts, possibly leading to ductopenia. We suggest that itraconazole should be added to the list of drugs that may be responsible for a drug-induced vanishing bile duct syndrome. Further histologic documentation in other cases is necessary to strengthen our current findings.",2002,11881322,no
Invasive aspergillosis in allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients: increasing antigenemia is associated with progressive disease.,"The kinetics of serum Aspergillus galactomannan, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, was examined in 37 allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients treated for invasive aspergillosis (IA). Fifty-eight periods of response (""response episodes"") were evaluated. There were 42 response episodes that were considered ""treatment failures"" and 16 that were considered ""good"" (that is, complete or partial) responses. At baseline (the first day of each new response episode), the patients who experienced treatment failure and those who had good responses did not differ significantly with regard to median galactomannan index (GMI) value. Thereafter, GMI values significantly increased in the treatment failure group, whereas no significant changes were observed in the good response group (P=.002). An increase in the GMI value of 1.0 over the baseline value during the first week of observation was predictive of treatment failure with a sensitivity of 44%, a specificity of 87%, and a positive predictive value of 94%. We conclude that serial determination of serum GMI values is a useful tool for assessing prognosis of IA in allogeneic SCT recipients during treatment.",2002,11880959,no
Immune response modulation by recombinant peptides expressed in virus-like particles.,"Aspergillus fumigatus, a ubiquitous fungus, is implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of clinically different allergic diseases in man, including allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Peptide-based immunotherapy may offer an alternative treatment strategy for the management of allergic disease. The objective of this study was to alter the allergen-specific immune response using dominant T cell epitopes of a major A. fumigatus allergen, Asp f2, expressed in yeast as virus-like particles (VLP). The T cell epitopes of Asp f2, recognized in mice with an H-2d background, were determined by producing T-cell hybridomas. Two dominant T cell epitopes, aa60--71 and aa235--249, were identified and expressed in a yeast VLP system. To induce tolerance VLP-peptides were injected subcutaneously into mice previously immunized with recombinant Asp f2. The T cell immune response was abrogated totally in 3 weeks following a single injection of VLP but was restored 2 months later following intranasal antigen exposure. T-cell depletion resulted in the reduction of 20-30% of all antigen-specific immunoglobulin classes. Thus, recombinant peptides expressed in the VLP system can be used successfully in the modulation of Asp f2-induced immune response in mice, although a single administration is not sufficient to maintain a state of tolerance for a long period of time.",2002,11876740,no
"Heterologous expression, purification, and immunological reactivity of a recombinant HSP60 from Paracoccidioides brasiliensis.","The complete coding cDNA of HSP60 from Paracoccidioides brasiliensis was overexpressed in an Escherichia coli host to produce high levels of recombinant protein. The protein was purified by affinity chromatography. A total of 169 human serum samples were tested for reactivity by Western blot analysis with the purified HSP60 recombinant protein. Immunoblots indicated that the recombinant P. brasiliensis HSP60 was recognized by antibodies in 72 of 75 sera from paracoccidioidomycosis patients. No cross-reactivity was detected with individual sera from patients with aspergillosis, sporotrichosis, cryptococcosis, and tuberculosis. Reactivity to HSP60 was observed in sera from 9.52% of control healthy individuals and 11.5% of patients with histoplasmosis. The high sensitivity and specificity (97.3 and 92.5%, respectively) for HSP60 suggested that the recombinant protein can be used singly or in association with other recombinant antigens to detect antibody responses in P. brasiliensis-infected patients.",2002,11874881,no
Animal models of aspergillosis - also useful for vaccination strategies?,"The attempt to establish vaccination strategies against infections caused by Aspergillus fumigatus seems to be questionable. Invasive aspergilloses are opportunistic diseases of the immunocompromised host and only a passive immunization with immunoglobulins could be taken into consideration. Until now there have been no preclinical and/or clinical data available concerning the efficacy of specific immunoglobulins animal experiments could offer an approach for the preclinical assessment of this topic. Generally, A. fumigatus is an opportunistic pathogen. Birds show a relatively high susceptibility to infections caused by A. fumigatus. In laboratory animal species, rabbits seem to have the highest susceptibility followed by mice, rats and guinea-pigs. Mice are easy to handle in all-day laboratory use, and infections are mostly established by the intravenous, intranasal or intraperitoneal route. The main target organs of infection are the kidneys by all three infection routes. Forty clinical isolates of A. fumigatus tested showed a comparable virulence in systemic infections in the intravenously infected mouse model. By using histopathological techniques, we also observed infectious lesions within the central nervous system in all cases. Only A. fumigatus strains lacking green pigmentation showed a significantly lower virulence. Histopathological examinations are of great benefit in the study of these animal models as they give detailed information about the infectious process. Measuring colony-forming units in tissues is only of minor use in prediction as it cannot discriminate between infective tissue lesions and cavity-infections/persistence, e.g. in the kidney pelvis. Quantitative methods for measuring fungal organ burdens, e.g. by chitin-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, have also been described and offer an alternative towards solely measuring colony-forming units in tissues.",2002,11856435,no
Expression of the Pycnoporus cinnabarinus laccase gene in Aspergillus niger and characterization of the recombinant enzyme.,"Pycnoporus cinnabarinus laccase lac1 gene was overexpressed in Aspergillus niger, a well-known fungal host producing a large amount of homologous or heterologous enzymes for industrial applications. The corresponding cDNA was placed under the control of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter as a strong and constitutive promoter. The laccase signal peptide or the glucoamylase preprosequence of A. niger was used to target the secretion. Both signal peptides directed the secretion of laccase into the culture medium as an active protein, but the A. niger preprosequence allowed an 80-fold increase in laccase production. The identity of the recombinant protein was further confirmed by immunodetection using Western blot analysis and N-terminal sequencing. The molecular mass of the mature laccase was 70 kDa as expected, similar to that of the native form, suggesting no hyperglycosylation. The recombinant laccase was purified in a three-step procedure including a fractionated precipitation using ammonium sulfate, and a concentration by ultrafiltration followed by a Mono Q column. All the characteristics of the recombinant laccase are in agreement with those of the native laccase. This is the first report of the production of a white-rot laccase in A. niger.",2002,11856319,no
Molecular evaluation of the plasma membrane proton pump from Aspergillus fumigatus.,"The gene encoding the plasma membrane proton pump (H+ -ATPase) of Aspergillus fumigatus, PMA1, was characterized from A. fumigatus strain NIH 5233 and clinical isolate H11-20. An open reading frame of 3,109 nucleotides with two introns near the N terminus predicts a protein consisting of 989 amino acids with a molecular mass of approximately 108 kDa. The predicted A. fumigatus enzyme is 89 and 51% identical to H+ - ATPases of Aspergillus nidulans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively. The A. fumigatus PMA1 is a typical member of the P-type ATPase family that contains 10 predicted transmembrane segments and conserved sequence motifs TGES, CSDKTGT, MLTGD, and GDGVN within the catalytic region. The enzyme represents 2% of the total plasma membrane protein, and it is characteristically inhibited by orthovanadate, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of approximately 1.8 microM. H+ -ATPases from Aspergillus spp. contain a highly acidic insertion region of 60 amino acids between transmembrane segments 2 and 3, which was confirmed for the membrane-assembled enzyme with a peptide-derived antibody. An increasing A. fumigatus PMA1 copy number confers enhanced growth in low-pH medium, consistent with its role as a proton pump. These results provide support for the development of the A. fumigatus H+ -ATPase as a potential drug discovery target.",2002,11850239,no
The value of the determination of anti-Aspergillus IgG in the serodiagnosis of canine aspergillosis: comparison with galactomannan detection.,"Diagnosis of canine aspergillosis is difficult using currently available methods. It often passes unnoticed or is diagnosed in the later phases of the disease. We developed an ELISA technique to detect anti-Aspergillus antibodies in canine serum using an Aspergillus antigenic mycelial extract, which could then be used for the diagnosis of canine aspergillosis. We used a cut-off of X + 3SD obtained from 20 control sera. The test was performed on 46 dogs with lesions indicating possible aspergillosis and gave nine positive results: one systemic mycosis, two discospondylitis, one uveitis, two bronchopulmonary processes and three rhinitis. We compared this methodology with the PLATELIA technique in the follow-up of the affected dogs, obtaining the same limitations as in the diagnosis of human aspergillosis. We consider our ELISA technique using sera samples a speedy, safe and reliable method which enables us to follow up the evolution of the disease and the efficacy of the therapy chosen. A definitive diagnosis must still take into account the results of other tests such as clinical examination, radiographic studies, endoscopy and biopsy.",2002,11846019,no
Expression of a synthetic gene encoding the Asp-hemolysin from Aspergillus fumigatus in Escherichia coli.,"Asp-hemolysin is a hemolytic toxin from Aspergillus fumigatus and is a specific binding protein with high affinity for oxidized low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL). As a first step in clarifying the structure-function relationship of Asp-hemolysin, we expressed Asp-hemolysin in Escherichia coli (E. coli) as a fusion protein with a maltose-binding protein (MBP) and purified it by affinity chromatography on an amylose resin. The apparent molecular size of the protein produced by E. coli was approximately 57 kDa, as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. This is consistent with the predicted molecular size of 56.9 kDa for a fusion protein which includes 14.2 kDa of Asp-hemolysin and 42.7 kDa from MBP. The purified recombinant Asp-hemolysin showed an immunoreactivity with the anti-Asp-hemolysin antibody as revealed by western blot analysis. Furthermore, in dot blot analysis, MBP-Asp-hemolysin fusion protein exhibited binding activity to Ox-LDL as did native Asp-hemolysin.",2002,11824538,no
Scintigraphic imaging using 99mTc-labeled PEG liposomes allows early detection of experimental invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in neutropenic rats.,"The value of scintigraphic imaging using 99mTc labeled poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG) -liposomes for detecting invasive pulmonary aspergillosis at different stages of the disease was investigated in a rat model. At 24, 48, 72, 120 and 168 h after fungal inoculation scintigraphic images were obtained and biodistribution of the radiolabel was determined. Findings were compared with serum galactomannan detection and other parameters of progression of fungal infection. At 48 h liposomal uptake in the infected left lung was increased significantly and 82% of the scintigraphic images was assessed positive. Serum galactomannan was only detected at 72 h and later. Liposomal uptake in the infected left lung increased over time and was significantly correlated with both the size of the pulmonary hemorrhagic lesion and the levels of circulating galactomannan. It was concluded that scintigraphic imaging using 99mTc-PEG-liposomes allows early detection of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in this model, and that liposomal uptake in the infected lung was strongly associated with the severity of the disease.",2002,11823122,no
[Diagnosis of aspergillosis and other invasive filamentous fungal infections in hematology].,"Invasive filamentous fungal infections (FFI) are difficult to diagnose in the department of hematology a variety of arguments are necessary to confirm the fungal origin. Our study evaluated prospectively, in a large population in South Eastern France, the diagnostic techniques used ante and post mortem (mycology, anatomopathology, serology and aspergillosis antigens) to prove an FFI.Two hundred and twenty eight neutropenic patients with obvious, probable, highly probable or presumed FFI were selected. Since completion of this study, a new classification of aspergillosis, with 3 instead of 4 levels of diagnosis, has been defined by the ICAAC in San Francisco but has not yet been published. Mycological or histological examinations were been performed on broncho-alveolar washings (BAW), puncture liquids or biopsies. Serology used precipitation, hemagglutination, immunofluorescence or ELISA techniques. Aspergillosis antigens were researched using the Pastorex method (agglutination of latex particles), launched at the beginning of the study.Invasive aspergillosis was diagnosed in 43.4% of patients, a non-aspergilla FFI in 6.5%, and no fungi was isolated in the cultures of 50% of patients. Ante mortem, 160 patients underwent BAW with a total of 175 samples. Among the latter, 41.7% mycological examinations were positive (presence of mycelium filaments and/or positive cultures) with 68.7% of Aspergillus fumigatus. Of the 48 puncture liquids, 25% of direct examinations and 29% of cultures were positive. Biopsies were taken from 59 patients and explored for mycology: 63.8% of direct examinations and 46.8% of cultures were positive for those explored histologically, 76.7% revealed the presence of mycelium filaments. Post mortem, 17 patients out of 79 deceased underwent a total of 24 autopsy or biologic sampling. For 5 patients, FFI was diagnosed post mortem. Aspergillus serology and antigen explorations were conducted respectively in 202 and 182 patients and were positive in 31% and 33%. The presence of antibodies appears to be a good prognostic factor compared with the presence of antigens.Biological diagnosis of FFI relies on the multiplicity of examinations and renewal of mycological sampling.",2002,11819919,no
Evaluation of lectin staining in the diagnosis of fungal keratitis in an experimental rabbit model.,"To assess the sensitivity, specificity, and reliability of peroxidase labeled lectin staining in the diagnosis of fungal keratitis in an experimental rabbit model.Fungal keratitis by Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Fusarium solani was induced in rabbits. WGA-peroxidase staining of 660 corneal sections was performed. Fungal staining was evaluated independently by two observers. The test sensitivity, specificity, and reliability indexes were calculated.The sensitivity of the lectin staining test for Candida albicans was 100% (95% CI: 93.51-100.00), and specificity was 100% (95% CI: 93.51-100.00). The sensitivity of the test for Aspergillus fumigatus was 96.36% (95% CI: 86.46-99.35), and specificity was 100% (95% CI: 93.51-100.00). The sensitivity of the test for Fusarium solani was 96.36% (95% CI: 86.46-99.35) and specificity was 96.15% (95% CI: 85.74-99.31). There was also a high degree of test-retest and inter-rater concordance for all three fungi tested. The test-retest k reliability indexes were 0.9455, 0.9636, and 0.8879, for Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Fusarium solani, respectively. The inter-rater k reliability indexes were 0.9636, 0.9818, and 0.9252, for Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Fusarium solani, respectively.WGA-peroxidase staining is a very sensitive, specific, and reliable test for the identification of fungi in an experimental rabbit model of fungal keratitis.",2002,11815751,no
Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in pulmonary aspergilloma.,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a cytokine associated with malignant neoplasms, is increased in a number of inflammatory and infectious disorders. But little is known about VEGF in pulmonary aspergilloma (PA). In order to clarify the predictive value of VEGF in PA, we examined serum VEGF levels in PA patients as well as expression of VEGF in the PA lesion. Patients Twenty-one patients with PA (6 with hemoptysis and the rest without hemoptysis) were investigated.In all patients, serum VEGF levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We examined the statistical correlations of serum VEGF levels with the ratio of affected area to total lung volume and VEGF with PaO2 levels. In patients with hemoptysis, we measured the serum VEGF levels three months after the initiation of therapy. We examined the expression of VEGF in the resected lung tissue of 4 patients with PA using immunohistochemistry.Serum VEGF levels showed a significant positive correlation with the ratio of affected to total lung area and a significant negative correlation with PaO2 levels. Serum VEGF levels in patients with hemoptysis were significantly higher than in those without hemoptysis. The serum levels of VEGF in patients with hemoptysis decreased significantly in parallel with the alleviation of hemoptysis. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated the expression of VEGF in alveolar macrophages in the lesion of PA patients.We suggest that VEGF can be used as a serum marker to determine the extent of the lesion, hypoxia and hemoptysis in PA.",2002,11813843,no
"Aspergillus nidulans septin AspB plays pre- and postmitotic roles in septum, branch, and conidiophore development.","Members of the septin family of proteins act as organizational scaffolds in areas of cell division and new growth in a variety of organisms. Herein, we show that in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, the septin AspB is important for cellular division, branching, and conidiation both pre- and postmitotically. AspB localizes postmitotically to the septation site with an underlying polarity that is evident as cytokinesis progresses. This localization at the septation site is dependent on actin and occurs before the cross-wall is visible. AspB localizes premitotically as a ring at sites of branching and secondary germ tube emergence. It is the only known branch site marker. In addition, AspB is found at several stages during the development of the asexual reproductive structure, the conidiophore. It localizes transiently to the vesicle/metula and metula/phialide interfaces, and persistently to the phialide/conidiospore interface. A temperature-sensitive mutant of AspB shows phenotypic abnormalities, including irregular septa, high numbers of branches, and immature asexual reproductive structures.",2002,11809826,no
Diagnosis of fungal infections: current status.,"Diagnosing infections remains a problem in the management of fungal diseases, particularly in the immunocompromised host. Signs and symptoms are non-specific, colonization is difficult to distinguish from invasive disease, blood cultures are commonly negative and patients are often unable to undergo invasive diagnostic procedures. This situation has led to the strategy of initiating empirical therapy in the high-risk patient. A variety of tests has been applied to several body fluids. At the simplest level, the clinician must be familiar with the appearance of various fungi in tissue. Non-culture methods include antibody- and antigen-based assays, metabolite detection and molecular identification. The latter includes PCR identification of fungal DNA from body fluid samples using conserved or specific genome sequences. Detection of glucan in blood has been achieved using crab amoebocyte lysate. With aspergillosis, predictive clinical correlates have been defined, respiratory tract cultures are highly predictive of invasive disease in the appropriate setting and certain CT scan findings enable early diagnosis. Bronchoalveolar lavage is also very useful. Galactomannan antigen testing of blood is routine in some European centres, with EIA methodology supplanting agglutination because of apparently greater sensitivity. PCR has been made specific by genus-specific probes, with 100% sensitivity and reasonable specificity. In candidosis, the number of sites of colonization correlates with invasion. Tests for mannan antibodies and antigenaemia are currently of interest. Metabolite assays appeared promising but have not been pursued commercially. In cryptococcosis, pronase treatment of serum has reduced false positives and false negatives, and improved reproducibility of titres. Birdseed agar improves culture specificity. In coccidioidomycosis, serology is the exemplar for all mycology. Gene probes have accelerated diagnosis by culture. In histoplasmosis, the antigenuria test's high sensitivity and specificity has dispelled the chronic confusion in interpreting antibody test results.",2002,11801576,no
Aspergillus fumigatus cell wall: composition and biosynthesis.,"Analysis of the cell wall of Aspergillus fumigatus is guided by obvious biological reasons: the cell wall protects the fungus against the aggressive human defense reactions, it harbours most of the fungal antigens and it represents a potential drug target. This review will discuss our current understanding of the structural organization of the polysaccharides constitutive of the cell wall of A. fumigatus [alpha and beta(1,3)-glucans, chitin, galactomannan, and beta(1,3),(1,4)-glucan] and of the enzymes (synthases, transglycosidases, and glycosyl hydrolases) responsible for their biosynthesis and remodelling. Comparative analysis of the cell wall of the conidium and mycelium also provides insights on their respective roles during the pathogenic life of this fungal species.",2002,11800273,no
Galactomannan and polymerase chain reaction for the diagnosis of primary digestive aspergillosis in a patient with acute myeloid leukaemia.,"Primary intestinal invasive aspergillosis is rarely reported in leukaemic patients. We describe a case of jejunal invasive aspergillosis in the setting of aplasia following chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia. The diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy obtained during surgery and our polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test confirmed Aspergillus flavus as the fungus responsible. This patient had high levels of circulating galactomannan, an antigen secreted by Aspergillus sp., in serum. The ELISA test for galactomannan has been developed to improve the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis but presents a 5-15% false positive rate. We suggest that some false positive results might be due to non-respiratory invasive aspergillosis, the usual localization of invasive aspergillosis. Our PCR test was also positive in serum. In case of positive results in serum with antigen and/or PCR tests without respiratory symptoms, the intestinal localizations should be investigated.",2002,11798263,no
Influence of environmental and genetic factors on allergen-specific immunoglobulin-E levels in sera from Lipizzan horses.,"To investigate whether allergen-specific IgE production is influenced by environmental and genetic factors, IgE levels against 2 mould extracts (Alternaria alternata [Alt a] and Aspergillus fumigatus [Asp f]) and against recombinant (r) rAlt a 1, rAsp f 7 and rAsp f 8 were determined by ELISA in sera from 448 Lipizzan horses living in 6 studfarms. Statistical evaluation showed a significant effect of studfarm-specific environment on IgE levels against the different allergens, but genetic factors also influenced allergen-specific IgE production: an heritability of 0.33 was found for IgE levels against the 2 mould extracts and of 0.21 for rAsp f 8-specific IgE. Heritability estimates for rAlt a 1- and rAsp f 7-specific IgE were negligible. Investigations for a possible association between Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I antigens and specific IgE levels were carried out. The most consistent significant association was found between the equine leucocyte antigen (ELA) A8 and undetectable IgE titres against rAsp f 7 and rAsp f 8. Significant ELA associations were also demonstrated between ELA A1 and higher specific IgE levels, between ELA A14 and lower IgE levels against the mould extracts and in one studfarm between ELA Be27 and lower Aspergillus-specific IgE levels.",2002,11770995,no
[A case of diffuse panbronchiolitis with SLE complicated by fungal infection].,"We report a patient who developed SLE during the course of diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) and had candidiasis later. The patient fulfilled the criteria for diagnosis of SLE after appearance of fever and general peripheral arthritis. Regarding serum virus antibody values at the time of SLE diagnosis, IgG and IgM of human Parvovirus B19 (B19) were positive by the EIA test and also by the serum PCR test. For continuously Pseudomonas aeruginozae in sputum cultures because of existing DPB, immunosuppressasnt therapy with prednisolone and mizoribine was given while suppressing proliferation of bacterial infections with antibiotics. As a result, the intensity of SLE decreased smoothly. About 1 month after beginning of the treatment, the chest X-ray revealed infiltrative densities in the lingual area of the left lobule and in S3 of the right lobule. Judging from the clinical course and various examination findings, concurrence of candidiasis was suspected. Fungal infection in this patient was progressive, so various antifungal agents were used concurrently. Furthermore, immunoglobulin therapy was supplemented while determining serum immunoglobulin levels, and doses of prednisolone and mizoribine were reduced rapidly. Afterward the patient followed a satisfactory clinical course. About 2 years later SLE recurred, aspergillosis developed concurrently and the disease progressed rapidly to its termination. DPB itself is difficult to control and often complicated with various diseases. Therefore, immunosuppresant therapy for complications is sometimes used in addition to the treatment of DPB. More careful observations on the clinical course are necessary in dealing with this disease.",2002,11766380,no
Aspergillus detection in bronchoscopically acquired material. Significance and interpretation.,"Pulmonary invasive aspergillosis is frequently difficult to diagnose. In particular, the value of the cultivation of Aspergillus and the Aspergillus galactomannan antigen detection (Pastorex) in bronchoscopically acquired material (bronchoalveolar lavage = BAL, bronchial lavage = BL) in the course of diagnosing this mycosis is viewed controversially. Between January 1996 and September 1999, we obtained 114 positive results in 100 bronchoscopically aquired specimens from a total of 69 patients. 59 of the 69 patients were immunosuppressed, 42 suffered from pulmonary aspergillosis and 38 suffered from invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The positive prediction rate for a positive result with regard to pulmonary aspergillosis in bronchoscopically acquired material was approximately 61%. Cultivation of Aspergillus was more successful in BAL, and the Aspergillus antigen detection was more successful in BL.",2002,11766098,no
"[Correlation between positive skin tests to molds, total IgE, and specific IgE using ELISA and mold cultures from the environment of the pediatric allergy patient].","The aim of this study was to made a correlation between allergic symptoms, positive skin prick test to fungi, total and specific IgE and mold culture in the patient's environmental. There were included 35 children (3-16 years), with skin prick test positive to fungi. The most frequent were: Rhizopus, Aspergillus, Cladosporium and Candida. Total and specific IgE were measured with ELISA, with titers high in 77.2% and 31.4% respectively. Fungal cultures were collected from dwellings and schools. The most frequently isolated mold genera were Cladosporium, Alternaria and Penicillium in the same proportion in both places: dwellings and schools. We concluded fungi are commonly found in children's environment.",2002,11759255,no
"Cyclophilins, a new family of cross-reactive allergens.","Type I allergic reactions occur by immediate release of anaphylactogenic mediators due to cross-linking of IgE bound to the high-affinity Fc(epsilon)RI on the surface of effector cells of sensitized individuals after allergen exposure. IgE-mediated hypersensitivity against normally innocuous environmental antigens is of clinical importance because of an increasing incidence of asthma and severe atopic diseases causing raising health care burdens to the society. A vast variety of different molecular structures has been shown to be able to induce hypersensitivity reactions. However, the high structural homology between phylogenetically conserved allergenic proteins present in different, apparently unrelated sources of exposure seems to play an important role in IgE-mediated poly-sensitization. These allergen families, formally termed pan-allergens, represent proteins sharing a high degree of sequence homology. Here we report cloning, production and serological investigations of a new pan-allergen family, the cyclophilins, found to be cross-reactive across species including humans. IgE-mediated cross-reactivity against autoantigens may contribute to perpetuation of severe atopic disorders even in the absence of exogenous allergen exposure. The molecular definition of pan-allergen families may substantially contribute to reduce the number of structures needed for diagnosis and therapy of allergic diseases based on highly pure, standardized recombinant allergens.",2001,11753999,no
"Antifungal efficacy of caspofungin (MK-0991) in experimental pulmonary aspergillosis in persistently neutropenic rabbits: pharmacokinetics, drug disposition, and relationship to galactomannan antigenemia.","The antifungal efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and safety of caspofungin (CAS) were investigated in the treatment and prophylaxis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis due to Aspergillus fumigatus in persistently neutropenic rabbits. Antifungal therapy consisted of 1, 3, or 6 mg of CAS/kg of body weight/day (CAS1, CAS3, and CAS6, respectively) or 1 mg of deoxycholate amphotericin B (AMB)/kg/day intravenously for 12 days starting 24 h after endotracheal inoculation. Prophylaxis (CAS1) was initiated 4 days before endotracheal inoculation. Rabbits treated with CAS had significant improvement in survival and reduction in organism-mediated pulmonary injury (OMPI) measured by pulmonary infarct score and total lung weight (P < 0.01). However, animals treated with CAS demonstrated a paradoxical trend toward increased residual fungal burden (log CFU per gram) and increased serum galactomannan antigen index (GMI) despite improved survival. Rabbits receiving prophylactic CAS1 also showed significant improvement in survival and reduction in OMPI (P < 0.01), but there was no effect on residual fungal burden. In vitro tetrazolium salt hyphal damage assays and histologic studies demonstrated that CAS had concentration- and dose-dependent effects on hyphal structural integrity. In parallel with a decline in GMI, AMB significantly reduced the pulmonary tissue burden of A. fumigatus (P < or = 0.01). The CAS1, CAS3, and CAS6 dose regimens demonstrated dose-proportional exposure and maintained drug levels in plasma above the MIC for the entire 24-h dosing interval at doses that were > or =3 mg/kg/day. As serial galactomannan antigen levels may be used for therapeutic monitoring, one should be aware that profoundly neutropenic patients receiving echinocandins for aspergillosis might have persistent galactomannan antigenemia despite clinical improvement. CAS improved survival, reduced pulmonary injury, and caused dose-dependent hyphal damage but with no reduction in residual fungal burden or galactomannan antigenemia in persistently neutropenic rabbits with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.",2001,11751105,no
Galactomannan enzyme immunoassay for monitoring systemic infection with Aspergillus fumigatus in mice.,"Intravenous (i.v.) infection of immunocompetent mice with Aspergillus fumigatus was used to investigate the ability of a commercial galactomannan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to monitor the course of organ infection after dissemination. The test detected 100% of the fungemias which occurred for up to 5 days after infection. When blood-cultures became negative but there was a high load of fungi in the parenchymal organs and a positive culture from the brain, the ELISA was again positive in all animals. However, when blood cultures as well as brain cultures were negative and lower amounts of fungi demarcated by immune cells were present in the liver and kidneys which was the case between day 5 and 30 of infection, the test was negative in most of the animals. Therefore, the test was excellent for detection of early i.v. infection with Aspergillus fumigatus but not suited for detection of limited organ infection in immunocompetent mice.",2001,11750162,no
Rapid diagnostic evaluation of bronchial washings in patients with suspected coccidioidomycosis.,"Coccidioidomycosis is a regionally common fungal infection, primarily affecting the lung. While in the majority of cases the tempo of the disease allows for a more leisurely diagnostic plan, including multiple serologic tests and culture of respiratory secretions, occasionally, patients will present with rapidly progressive, life-threatening pulmonary illness, in whom there is an urgent need for rapid diagnosis. Evaluation of respiratory secretions including expectorated sputum as well as bronchial washings are frequently available or obtained for diagnosing pulmonary infiltrates. We compared the sensitivity of the Papanicolaou stain with 10% potassium hydroxide digestion (10% KOH) and with calcofluor white (cw). The Papanicolaou test performed the best and should be used in the evaluation of suspected patients with coccidioidomycosis.",2001,11740824,no
Further studies on the multiple forms of protease ALP of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"The author studied the presence of multiple forms of the main extracellular protease ALP in three strains of Aspergillus fumigatus that differed in geographical origin, and in mutants of one of these strains with disrupted genes coding for the main proteases ALP and MEP. The pattern of multiple proteolytic bands after isoelectric focusing was, in all three wild strains, nearly the same and was not changed after inactivation of the MEP gene. However, in ALP-deficient mutants all multiple forms also disappeared. The multiple forms observed must therefore be products of post-translational processing of the protease ALP and not true isoenzymes (products of different genes of a gene family). Further experiments did not prove that phosphorylation and glycosylation were involved in the formation of the multiple forms under study.",2001,11714066,no
The Platelia Aspergillus ELISA in diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergilosis (IPA).,"The sensitivity of a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting Aspergillus galactomannan was evaluated with 66 serum samples and 113 specimens of the respiratory tract obtained from 52 patients with pulmonary diseases. The patients were divided into five groups: proven invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) (five patients), probable IPA (seven patients), Aspergillus colonization (eight patients) or unlikely Aspergillus infection (27 patients). Another five patients with doubtful diagnostic test results are discussed in detail. The results of the Platelia Aspergillus ELISA (Sanofi Pasteur, Freiburg, Germany) in testing specimens of the respiratory tract were 90% sensitivity in proven (serum 38%), 60% in probable (serum 37%) and 71% in Aspergillus colonization (serum 0%). Furthermore, 85% of the Aspergillus spp. from positive cultures of specimens of the respiratory tract were also detected in the ELISA. A total of 57% of the culture negative specimens of patients with a least one positive culture or proven aspergillosis in a series of specimens were positive in the ELISA.",2001,11714060,no
Enzymatic degradation of guar and substituted guar galactomannans.,"Enzymatic degradation of guar galactomannan is studied using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and steady shear viscometry. In very dilute polymer solutions, reaction rate increases with first-order kinetics with substrate concentration. In the intermediate concentration regime, the enzyme/polymer binding saturates, and the degradation kinetics is zero-order. The observations are in accord with a Michaelis-Menton kinetics model. The Michaelis-Menton parameter, Km and Vmax, were determined to be 0.6 mM and 7.8 x 10(-10) mol/(mL s) for guar at pH = 7, where the maximal velocity of the reaction, Vmax, was measured in terms of the molar concentration of glycosidic bonds broken per unit time. However, as the solution increases in concentration, the reaction rate decreases and the enzyme diffusion through the concentrated polymer gel becomes a limiting factor. A reaction-diffusion model is presented to express the competition between enzyme reaction and diffusion. The scaling theory and kinetic data are used to define the boundaries of the polymer concentration regimes between substrate (i.e., polymer strand) limited reactions, enzyme limited reactions, and hindered diffusion limited reactions. The influence of polymer derivatization on the degradation kinetics was also explored. The degradation rate was shown to be greatly affected by the type of substituent groups as well as the degree of substitution. The triggering mechanism and controlled degradation were found for the enzymatic hydrolysis of cationically derivatized guar solutions.",2001,11710212,no
Triggered enzymatic degradation of a water-soluble polymer solution using a novel inhibitor.,"Controlled enzymatic degradation of solutions of guar galactomannan, a naturally occurring polysaccharide, offers a powerful tool to enhance its usage in a variety of applications. In this study, we use viscometry to investigate the use of tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) as a reversible, pH-dependent inhibitor to control the degradation of guar galactomannan by Aspergillus niger beta-mannanase. Viscosity measurements of pH 9 guar solutions containing 25 mM Tris show no reduction in the viscosity when treated with beta-mannanase. In contrast, samples containing no Tris show significant reduction in viscosity within an hour. Samples maintained at a pH of 9 in the presence of Tris for several hours show no change in viscosity however, reduction of the pH of the sample to 4 initiates enzymatic degradation of the guar solution resulting in a rapid reduction in solution viscosity. This reversible, pH-dependent inhibition is possibly a result of the protonation state of Tris as well as key amino acids in the active site.",2001,11710199,no
"Degradation of mannan I and II crystals by fungal endo-beta-1,4-mannanases and a beta-1,4-mannosidase studied with transmission electron microscopy.","We have used the endo-beta-1,4-mannanase from Trichoderma reesei (Tr Man5A), the endo-beta-1,4-mannanase from Aspergillus niger (An Man5A) and the exo-beta-1,4-mannosidase from A. niger (An Mnd2A) to follow the enzymatic degradation of mannan I and II crystals. The degradation process was studied by transmission electron microscopy and also followed by analysis of the released soluble reducing sugars. The mannan crystals were degraded by the endo-beta-1,4-mannanases and to a lesser extent by the exo-beta-1,4-mannosidase. The observed hydrolysis pattern on mannan I crystals is fully consistent with the current view of the molecular structure of these crystals. The molecular organization of the mannan chains in mannan II crystals is less clear and the digestion results give some further information about the ultrastructure of mannan II. In addition, insight is provided into the mode of the enzymatic attack on the crystals of mannan I and mannan II.",2001,11710023,no
[Monitoring and prophylaxis].,"Invasive deep mycoses following bone marrow and solid-organ transplantation remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Species of Candida and Aspergillus account for more than 80% of these mycoses. Because these infections are often difficult to diagnose and treat successfully, antifungal prophylaxis is recommended in high-risk patients. Fluconazole is useful in patients who are at risk of invasive candidiasis, including bone marrow transplants, liver and pancreatic transplants. Although invasive aspergillosis is frequent in patients with bone marrow, lung and heart transplantation, no established methods have been available for its prophylaxis. Recently, efforts to improve the efficiency of diagnostic tests have been directed toward the detection of fungal components or metabolites. The requirements for clinical use (monitoring) are as follows: capability of early diagnosis, quantitative measurement, and easy sampling and simple assay procedure. The detection of plasma (1-3)-beta-D-glucan (BDG), a characteristic cell wall component of almost all fungi, is widely used in Japan. Twenty-seven episodes of fungemia were observed in our hematology ward and all were positive with BDG. Positive results were observed before the documentation of fungemia in 14 patients (51.9%). Although the positive rate of BDG also was 100% in 17 patients with invasive aspergillosis, it rose slightly at an early stage of the disease in 13 patients (76.5%). The determination of plasma BDG appears useful in the monitoring of deep fungal infection, but its usefulness for early diagnosis remains to be determined. The utility of detection of Aspergillus galactomannan by ELISA and fungal DNA by polymerase chain reaction are also discussed.",2001,11704746,no
[Current approaches to diagnose invasive aspergillosis: application of real-time automated polymerase chain reaction].,"Blood and radiological tests are used to diagnose invasive aspergillosis (IA), but it remains unknown which is more useful. We recently made a prospective study to compare the usefulness of chest CT scan, latex agglutination test (LA) and determination of plasma (1-3)-beta-D-glucan (BDG) levels for IA diagnosis. Of 215 patients, 16 were diagnosed as definite IA. While sensitivities of LA and BDG were 44% and 63%, respectively, all the patients showed some abnormal signs on chest CT scans. On average, CT scans preceded LA by 7.1 days and BDG by 11.5 days. Interestingly, false-positive rate of the blood tests increased during neutropenia. Because lung is the usual portal of Aspergillus, chest CT scan may be more beneficial than the blood tests for early diagnosis of IA. Care is necessary in interpreting the results of these tests, especially when patients are neutropenic. Blood tests must be sensitive and their results must be interpreted quantitatively. We recently developed a new quantitative diagnostic system for IA using real-time PCR. In vitro examination using 10(2) copies of Aspergillus DNA showed that linearity was obtained when there were more than 20 copies. We examined 323 samples taken from 122 patients with hematological malignancies. Blood samples were subjected to real-time PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA) and BDG. Sensitivity of real-time PCR, EIA and BDG was 79, 58 and 67%, respectively. Specificity of each assay was 92, 97 and 84%, respectively. Real-time PCR was highly sensitive for IA diagnosis, and quantification was accurate.",2001,11704742,no
Purification and characterization of an invertase produced by Aspergillus ochraceus TS.,"Purification and characterization of an extracellular invertase produced by Aspergillus ochraceus TS are reported. The enzyme was purified (42-fold) from culture filtrate by salt precipitation, ion-exchange and gel filtration. Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of the purified enzyme showed a single band of molecular mass 66 kDa. The molecular mass of the native enzyme was found to be 130 kDa by gel filtration. The purity of the protein was also checked against its antiserum raised in rabbits by two-dimensional immunodiffusion in agarose gel and Western blot that showed a single band. It is a glycoprotein with mannose as its carbohydrate residue. The enzyme showed high affinity for sucrose with a Km of 3.5 mM. The amino acid analysis revealed a high proportion of acidic residues but it had a low content of cysteine, histidine and arginine comparable to other fungal invertases.",2001,11693382,no
A defined level of protein disulfide isomerase expression is required for optimal secretion of thaumatin by Aspegillus awamori.,"Thaumatin, a 22-kDa protein containing eight disulfide bonds, is secreted by the filamentous fungus Aspergillus awamori at levels which are dependent upon the extent of overexpression of protein disulfide isomerase (PDIA). Additional copies of the PDIA-encoding gene pdiA were introduced into a strain of A. awamori that expresses a cassette encoding thaumatin. Transformants with different levels of pdiA mRNA and measured PDIA levels were chosen for examination of the impact that PDIA levels had on thaumatin secretion. The secretion of two native proteins, alpha-amylase and acid phosphatase, was also examined in relation to varying levels of PDIA. Over a range of PDIA levels of 1-8, relative to the native level in strains with just one copy of the pdiA gene, the fraction of alpha-amylase and acid phosphatase in the total secreted protein was unaffected. In contrast, a peak level of thaumatin, about 5-fold higher than in the strain with one copy of pdiA, was found in strains with a relative PDIA level of between two and four. Improved thaumatin production was confirmed in 5-1 fermenters using a strain of A. awamori with six pdiA gene copies, containing 3.2-fold higher levels of PDIA than wild-type strains.",2001,11683266,no
Characterization of AFMP1: a novel target for serodiagnosis of aspergillosis.,"We cloned the AFMP1 gene, which encodes the first antigenic cell wall galactomannoprotein in Aspergillus fumigatus. AFMP1 codes for a protein, Afmp1p, of 284 amino acid residues, with a few sequence features that are present in Mp1p, the antigenic cell wall mannoprotein in Penicillium marneffei that we described previously, as well as several other cell wall proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans. It contains a serine- and threonine-rich region for O glycosylation, a signal peptide, and a putative glycosylphosphatidyl inositol attachment signal sequence. Specific anti-Afmp1p antibody was generated with recombinant Afmp1p protein purified from Escherichia coli to allow further characterization of Afmp1p. Afmp1p has a high affinity for Galanthus nivalis agglutinin, a characteristic indicative of a mannoprotein. Furthermore, it was recognized by a rat monoclonal antibody against the galactofuran side chain of galactomannan, indicating that it is a galactomannoprotein. Ultrastructural analysis by immunogold staining indicated that Afmp1p is present in the cell walls of the hyphae and conidia of A. fumigatus. Finally, it was observed that patients with aspergilloma and invasive aspergillosis due to A. fumigatus develop a specific antibody response against Afmp1p. This suggested that the recombinant protein and its antibody may be useful for serodiagnosis in patients with aspergilloma or invasive aspergillosis, and the protein may represent a good cell surface target for host humoral immunity.",2001,11682494,no
Fluorescence polarization: analysis of carbohydrate-protein interaction.,"Fluorescence polarization has been widely used for the studies on the molecular motion in solution and has been applied to immunoassays for proteins, therapeutic drug monitoring in clinical pharmacy, and assays for environmentally toxic compounds. Because fluorescence polarization is most readily applicable to the kinetic analysis of the binding reaction between a substance having small molecular mass and a receptor molecule, this method is easily applied to the analysis of carbohydrate-lectin binding. In this tutorial Thematic Review, we briefly introduce the principles of fluorescence polarization and some applications of fluorescence polarization technique to glycobiology.",2001,11673876,no
An inhibitor-resistant histone deacetylase in the plant pathogenic fungus Cochliobolus carbonum.,"We have partially purified and characterized histone deacetylases of the plant pathogenic fungus Cochliobolus carbonum. Depending on growth conditions, this fungus produces HC-toxin, a specific histone deacetylase inhibitor. Purified enzymes were analyzed by immunoblotting, by immunoprecipitation, and for toxin sensitivity. The results demonstrate the existence of at least two distinct histone deacetylase activities. A high molecular weight complex (430,000) is sensitive to HC-toxin and trichostatin A and shows immunoreactivity with an antibody against Cochliobolus HDC2, an enzyme homologous to yeast RPD3. The second activity, a 60,000 molecular weight protein, which is resistant even to high concentrations of well-known deacetylase inhibitors, such as HC-toxin and trichostatin A, is not recognized by antibodies against Cochliobolus HDC1 (homologous to yeast HOS2) or HDC2 and represents a different and/or modified histone deacetylase which is enzymatically active in its monomeric form. This enzyme activity is not present in the related filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. Furthermore, in vivo treatment of Cochliobolus mycelia with trichostatin A and analysis of HDACs during the transition from non-toxin-producing to toxin-producing stages support an HC-toxin-dependent enzyme activity profile.",2001,11669622,no
Effect of dexamethasone on IL-10 and IL-12p40 production in newborns and adults.,"The effect of dexamethasone (DEX) on interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-12p40 production was examined in preterm newborns, term infants and was compared to that in adults. Mononuclear cells isolated from newborn cord blood (CBMC) and peripheral blood from adults (PBMC) were incubated with lipopolysaccharide in the absence or presence of DEX at concentrations between 10(-8) and 10(-5) M. Cytokine concentration in the supernatants was tested using ELISA kits. DEX induced a dose-dependent inhibition of IL-10 production by PBMC from adults whereas CBMC from newborns were mostly unaffected by the drug. DEX caused a dose-dependent inhibition of IL-12p40 secretion by cells of the three age groups, although to a different extent. Since IL-12 plays a critical role in the development of a protective immune response to fungal infection, it is conceivable that the inhibition of IL-12p40 secretion caused by DEX may contribute to the increased occurrence of fungal infections in preterms treated with this drug.",2001,11641548,no
Detection of fungi in sinus fluid of patients with allergic fungal rhinosinusitis.,"We aim to develop a rapid, accurate and sensitive diagnostic assay with which to detect the surface antigens of fungi thought to be involved in allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS), by assessing the usefulness of immunofluorescence microscopy (IMF) and enzyme linked immuno-absorbent assays (ELISA). The age, sex, clinical symptoms and signs, imaging (CT and/or MRI), microbiological subculture data, sinus contents, blood eosinophilia, aspergillosis precipitins, radioallergoabsorbent technology (RAST) for fungal allergens and histopathology were performed on individuals undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery for suspected AFRS. Thirteen patients were examined, and five monoclonal antibodies raised to the surface washings of various fungi were found to recognize and differentiate between fungal species implicated in sinus disease, i.e. Aspergillus niger, Alternaria alternata, Cochliobolus lunata, Penicillium expansum and Cladosporium species. The IMF microscopy proved to be a useful assay to distinguish visually between the cultured fungi, but was less useful for visualization of fungi in the patient samples. However, ELISA assays with 5 monoclonal antibodies gave clear and unambiguous data as to the presence of certain fungi within the patient samples. There is good correlation between the ELISA data and the pathology findings. This preliminary study suggests that both IMF and ELISA techniques may offer an important advance in this area.",2001,11603793,no
Development of a flow-through enzyme immunoassay and application in screening green coffee samples for ochratoxin A with confirmation by high-performance liquid chromatography.,"A flow-through enzyme immunoassay has been developed for the screening of green coffee bean samples for ochratoxin A (OA) and was later used in a survey on OA in green coffee from different countries. The test has a sensitivity of 8 ng/g, and calculated recoveries ranged from 70 to 89% and from 86 to 95% for spiked and naturally contaminated samples, respectively. There were no significant differences in within-day and between-day assay performance (P > 0.05). Green coffee samples (15 Arabica and 7 Robusta) received from an international coffee trader were analyzed for intrinsic fungal contamination, screened for OA, and subsequently confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). All 22 samples were contaminated by fungal species of the genus Aspergillus, while Penicillium species were isolated from a mere 13.6% of the total number of samples. Isolates were tested for their ability to produce OA, and only 3.9% were positive. There was no correlation between occurrence of OA-producing isolates and levels of OA in contaminated samples. Results of the screening procedure showed that 4 of the 22 samples were contaminated with 8 ng/g or higher. The HPLC method confirmed that the OA levels ranged from 27 to 168 ng/g. A fifth sample, which was shown to be negative during screening, had an OA concentration of 4 ng/g. There were no false negatives or positives recorded, and the flow-through enzyme immunoassay results correlated with those obtained by HPLC.",2001,11601711,no
Involvement of fungal cell wall components in adhesion of Sporothrix schenckii to human fibronectin.,"Systemic sporotrichosis is an emerging infection potentially fatal for immunocompromised patients. Adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins is thought to play a crucial role in invasive fungal diseases. Here we report studies of the adhesion of Sporothrix schenckii to the extracellular protein fibronectin (Fn). Both yeast cells and conidia of S. schenckii were able to adhere to Fn as detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent binding assays. Adhesion of yeast cells to Fn is dose dependent and saturable. S. schenckii adheres equally well to 40-kDa and 120-kDa Fn proteolytic fragments. While adhesion to Fn was increased by Ca(2+), inhibition assays demonstrated that it was not RGD dependent. A carbohydrate-containing cell wall neutral fraction blocked up to 30% of the observed adherence for the yeast cells. The biochemical nature of this fraction suggests the participation of cell surface glycoconjugates in binding by their carbohydrate or peptide moieties. These results provide new data concerning S. schenckii adhesion mechanisms, which could be important in host-fungus interactions and the establishment of sporotrichosis.",2001,11598061,no
Use of real-time PCR on blood samples for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.,"We developed a new quantitative system for diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) using real-time automated polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Intra-assay and interassay precision rates for in vitro examination were 2.53% and 2.20%, respectively, and the linearity of this assay was obtained when there were >20 copies/well. We examined 323 samples taken from 122 patients with hematological malignancies, including 33 patients with IPA and 89 control patients. Blood samples were subjected to PCR antigen detection methods, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and determination of plasma (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan (BDG) concentration. The sensitivities of PCR, ELISA, and BDG measurement for diagnosis of IPA were 79%, 58%, and 67%, respectively the specificities were 92%, 97%, and 84%. Positive findings on PCR preceded those of computed tomography by -0.3+/-6.6 days, those of BDG measurement by 6.5+/-4.9 days, and those of ELISA by 2.8+/-4.1 days. Real-time PCR was sensitive for IPA diagnosis, and quantitation was accurate.",2001,11588697,no
Diagnosis and treatment of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is an underdiagnosed pulmonary disorder in asthmatic patients and patients with cystic fibrosis. Its clinical and diagnostic manifestations arise from an allergic response to multiple antigens expressed by fungi, most commonly Aspergillus fumigatus, colonizing the bronchial mucus. The clinical course is one of recurrent exacerbations characterized by chest infiltrates evident on chest x-ray films and associated with cough, wheeze, and sputum production that usually respond to oral corticosteroid treatment. Specific immunologic and radiologic markers of disease include elevation of the total serum IgE levels, presence of aspergillus IgE antibodies, and the occurrence of central bronchiectasis. Long-term treatment with corticosteroids is often required for effective management. The adverse effects of chronic corticosteroid use have led to attempts at treatment with antifungal agents such as itraconazole. Itraconazole has been reported anecdotally to be effective, and evidence for its effectiveness in randomized trials is still accruing. Consideration should be given to its use as a corticosteroid-sparing agent or for treatment of patients in whom corticosteroid response is poor. The natural history and prognosis of ABPA are not well characterized but may be complicated by progression to bronchiectasis and pulmonary fibrosis. If ABPA is diagnosed and treated before the development of bronchiectasis and fibrosis, these complications may be prevented.",2001,11560305,no
Role of early diagnosis and aggressive surgery in the management of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in neutropenic patients.,"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) occurs mostly in immunocompromised hosts and especially in neutropenic patients. Improved prognosis for IPA requires early diagnosis. We report our experience in the management of IPA in patients with hematological malignancies. In prolonged neutropenia (> 10 days), thoracic CT scanning seems to be the best choice for the diagnosis of IPA (with CT halo or air-crescent signs). Its systematic use allows a dramatic reduction in the time to achieve the diagnosis, if there is evidence of a halo sign. The systematic screening for the detection of Aspergillus antigenemia with an ELISA test is helpful for early diagnosis. The detection of Aspergillus antigen (with the less sensitive latex agglutination test) on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid may also be as useful. The treatment of IPA relies on amphotericin B (or its lipid formulations) or on azole antifungal agents. Pulmonary surgical resection should be considered either as an emergency procedure (despite persistent neutropenia) to avoid massive hemoptysis, or as an elective or diagnostic procedure. This global strategy for the management of IPA is associated with a 75-80% success rate in hematological patients. Nevertheless, the control of underlying malignancy remains a major prognostic factor.",2001,11525219,no
Critical assessment of issues in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.,"Invasive aspergillosis remains a devastating disease, which is partly because of the inability to identify infected patients at an early stage of the disease. Recently, new diagnostic tests and procedures have been developed to help in identifying high-risk patients. High-resolution computed tomography has been shown to be a potent tool for detecting pulmonary abnormalities in neutropenic patients. Assays for the detection of circulating markers such as fungal antigens or Aspergillus DNA have been developed and show that markers can be detected in the blood at an early stage of infection. Also, the markers correlate with the fungal burden in the tissue, which allows monitoring of response to antifungal therapy. The tests and procedures that are now available need to be incorporated into management strategies for at-risk patients and evaluated in clinical trials. Although we now have markers that allow the early detection of fungal products, many questions remain unanswered with respect to the kinetics of the markers in different patient groups, the optimal management strategy and the effect of prophylaxis and treatment on the markers. Nevertheless, the implementation of new approaches for the management of invasive aspergillosis offers opportunities to improve outcome of patients.",2001,11525216,no
"Fungal extracellular polysaccharides, beta (1-->3)-glucans and culturable fungi in repeated sampling of house dust.","Fungal exposure inside homes has been associated with adverse respiratory symptoms in children and adults. While fungal assessment has traditionally relied upon questionnaires, fungal growth on culture plates and spore counts, new immunoassays for extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) and beta (1-->3)-glucans have enabled quantitation of fungal agents in house dust in a more timely and cost-effective manner, possibly providing a better measure of fungal exposure. We investigated associations among measurements of EPS, beta (1-->3)-glucans and culturable fungi obtained from 23 Dutch homes. From each home, dust samples were vacuumed from the living room floor twice during the Fall, Winter and Spring seasons for a total of six collections (every 6 weeks from October 1997 to May 1998). Samples were sieved and fine dust was analyzed for EPS from Aspergillus and Penicillium spp. combined, beta (1-->3)-glucans and culturable fungi. EPS was positively associated with glucan an increase from the 25th to the 75th percentile of glucan concentration was associated with a 1.6-fold increase in EPS concentration (95% CI = 1.3 to 2.0",2001,11521501,no
Production of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) in Aspergillus niger.,"A protease-deficient strain of Aspergillus niger has been used as a host for the production of human tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). In defined medium, up to 0.07 mg t-PA (g biomass)(-1) was produced in batch and fed-batch cultures and production was increased two- to threefold in two-phase batch cultures in which additional glucose was provided as a single pulse at the end of the first batch growth phase. Production was increased [up to 1.9 mg t-PA (g biomass)(-1)] by the addition of soy peptone to the defined medium. The rate of t-PA production in batch cultures supplemented with soy peptone (0.2 to 0.6 mg t-PA L(-1) h(-1)) was comparable to rates observed previously in high-producing mammalian or insect cell cultures. In glucose-limited chemostat culture supplemented with soy peptone, t-PA was produced at a rate of 0.7 mg t-PA L(-1) h(-1). Expression of t-PA in A. niger resulted in increased expression of genes (bipA, pdiA, and cypB) involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR). However, when cypB was overexpressed in a t-PA-producing strain, t-PA production was not increased. The t-PA produced in A. niger was cleaved into two chains of similar molecular weight to two-chain human melanoma t-PA. The two chains appeared to be stable for at least 16 h in culture supernatant of the host strain. However, in general, <1% of the t-PA produced in A. niger was active, and active t-PA disappeared from the culture supernatant during the stationary phase of batch cultures, suggesting that the two-chain t-PA may have been incorrectly processed or that initial proteolytic cleavage occurred within the proteolytic domain of the protein. Total t-PA (detected by enzyme-linked immunoassay) also eventually disappeared from culture supernatants, confirming significant extracellular proteolytic activity, even though the host strain was protease-deficient.",2001,11505386,no
The use of an in-house biotin-avidin linked immunosorbent assay to detect Aspergillus antigens in sera of immunocompromised patients.,A biotin-avidin-linked immunosorbent assay was developed to detect Aspergillus antigens in sera of immunocompromised patients. The assay was based on a double antibody sandwich ELISA using polyclonal antibodies raised against water-soluble antigens of Aspergillus fumigatus. Aspergillus antigens were positive in sera of 9 of 16 (56%) patients who were studied prospectively and in 13 of 73 (19%) patients studied retrospectively. The 9 prospectively studied patients who were antigen positive were febrile neutropenic hematological malignancy patients who exhibited a high risk of acquiring invasive aspergillosis.,2001,11503293,no
Isolation of aflatoxigenic strains of Aspergillus and detection of aflatoxin B1 from feeds in India.,"In a preliminary study, 256 feed samples collected from different parts of Northern India were examined for the presence of aflatoxigenic strains of Aspergillus favus/parasiticus and for detection of Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). Out of 198 A. flavus and 15 A. parasiticus strains isolated, 76% and 86% respectively, were found to be toxigenic. Aflatoxin B1 content of these feeds, as estimated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were very high (average 0.412+/-0.154 ppm) in comparison to the permissible Indian regulation level (0.03 ppm). Seasonal variation of incidence and level of toxin in feed was recorded and it was high during monsoon/post monsoon period.",2001,11502060,no
Adenoviral infection after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT): report on 130 patients from a single SCT unit involved in a prospective multi center surveillance study.,"The incidence of adenovirus (AV) infections following SCT was determined in a prospective multicenter trial. Over 1 year, 130 consecutive patients undergoing allogeneic SCT at Essen University Hospital were included and followed for 6 months. Source of stem cells was blood in 68 cases. Fifty-eight patients had HLA-identical sibling donors. Throat swabs, urine and stool samples were screened weekly for AV antigen and DNA by ELISA and nested PCR, respectively. In 35 cases adenovirus infection was detected. There was no seasonal variation. Throat swabs were positive in 24, urine in 12, and stool in 11 cases, resulting in a cumulative risk of infection of 29%. The incidences of AV infection of the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urinary tract were 19%, 10%, and 9%, respectively, and infections were diagnosed after a median (range) interval of 44 (-2-179), 37 (-2-168), and 53 (17-153) days after transplantation. On multivariate analysis, presence of AV antibody in the donor and acute graft-versus-host disease grade IV were found to be independent risk factors for AV infection. Eleven patients had AV isolated from more than one site and five patients had probable AV disease. We were not able to identify patients in whom AV infection was the leading cause of death. The majority of patients infected with AV suffered from severe acute graft-versus-host disease often accompanied by other opportunistic infections, such as aspergillosis or CMV reactivation. Nineteen out of 36 patients who died during the observation period had AV infection. In summary, AV infection after allogeneic SCT was observed in a substantial number of patients. In addition to well-known risk factors for viral infection after SCT we were able to demonstrate that a positive AV antibody test in the donor is an important risk factor for AV infection. Further studies are needed, however, before final conclusions on the clinical sequelae of AV infection can be made and the role of preventive and therapeutic strategies toward AV infection after allogeneic SCT can be defined.",2001,11498744,no
Galactofuranoic-oligomannose N-linked glycans of alpha-galactosidase A from Aspergillus niger.,"Extracellular alpha-galactosidase A was purified from the culture filtrate of an over-producing strain of Aspergillus niger containing multiple copies of the encoding aglA gene under the control of the glucoamylase (glaA) promoter. Endoglycosidase digestion followed by SDS/PAGE, lectin and immunoblotting suggested that glycosylation accounted for approximately 25% of the molecular size of the purified protein. Monosaccharide analysis showed that this was composed of N-acetyl glucosamine, mannose and galactose. Mild acid hydrolysis, mild methanolysis, immunoblotting and exoglycosidase digestion indicated that the majority of the galactosyl component was in the furanoic conformation (beta-D-galactofuranose, Galf). At least 20 different N-linked oligosaccharides were fractionated by high-pH anion-exchange chromatography following release from the polypeptide by peptide-N-glycosidase F. The structures of these were subsequently determined by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry to be a linear series of Hex(7-26)HexHA(c2). Indicating that oligosaccharides from GlcNA(c2)Man(7), increasing in molecular size up to GlcNA(c2)Man(24) were present. Each of these were additionally substituted with up to three beta-Galf residues. Linkage analysis confirmed the presence of mild acid labile terminal hexofuranose residues. These results show that filamentous fungi are capable of producing a heterogeneous mixture of high molecular-size N-linked glycans substituted with galactofuranoic residues, on a secreted glycoprotein.",2001,11488905,no
"A single gene produces mitochondrial, cytoplasmic, and peroxisomal NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase in Aspergillus nidulans.","NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes catalyze the decarboxylation of isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate accompanied by the production of NADPH. In mammals two different genes encode mitochondrial and cytoplasmic/peroxisomal located enzymes, whereas in Saccharomyces cerevisiae three separate genes specify compartment specific enzymes. We have identified a single gene, idpA, in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans that specifies a protein with a high degree of identity to mammalian and S. cerevisiae enzymes. Northern blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed the presence of two idpA transcripts and two transcription start points were identified by sequencing cDNA clones and by 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The shorter transcript was found to be inducible by acetate and by fatty acids while the longer transcript was present in higher amounts during growth in glucose containing media. The longer transcript is predicted to encode a polypeptide containing an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence as well as a C-terminal tripeptide (ARL) as a potential peroxisomal targeting signal. The shorter transcript is predicted to encode a polypeptide lacking the mitochondrial targeting signal but retaining the C-terminal sequence. Immunoblotting using antibody raised against S. cerevisiae Idp1p detected two polypeptides consistent with these predictions. The functions of the predicted targeting sequences were confirmed by microscopic analysis of transformants containing fluorescent protein fusion constructs. Using anti-Idp1p antibodies, protein localization to mitochondria and peroxisomes was observed during growth on glucose whereas cytoplasmic and peroxisomal localization was found upon acetate or fatty acid induction. Therefore, we have established that by the use of two transcription start points a single gene is sufficient to specify localization of NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase to three different cellular compartments in A. nidulans.",2001,11483612,no
Fine needle aspiration cytology in lymphadenopathy of HIV-positive cases.,"To evaluate the role of fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) material in 25 HIV-positive cases with lymphadenopathy.We selected 25 cases for the present study who were enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay positive for HIV (HIV-1). FNAB was performed as a routine, outdoor procedure with informed consent of the patient. For each case, along with routine May-Grünwald-Giemsa and hematoxylin and eosin staining, Ziehl-Neelsen staining for acid-fast bacilli and periodic acid-Schiff staining for fungi were performed wherever necessary.A total of 28 sites were aspirated from 25 HIV patients. All these patients were heterosexual, and none had a history of drug abuse. FNAB was performed under ultrasound guidance in all four cases of a retroperitoneal group of lymph nodes. The most common FNAB diagnosis was reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (10), followed by tuberculosis (8). There were three cases diagnosed as fungal infection (two, Cryptococcus one, histoplasmosis). FNAB of a case of lymph node was suggestive of tuberculosis. There was one case each diagnosed as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and squamous cell carcinoma (metastatic). One case of a small axillary lymph node did not yield representative material.FNAB is a relatively inexpensive initial investigative technique in the diagnosis and management of HIV-positive patients. It can obviate the need for surgical excision and enable immediate treatment of specific infections.",2001,11480723,no
Real-time monitoring of enzymatic hydrolysis of galactomannans.,"Enzymatic hydrolysis was monitored in real-time using time dependent static light scattering (TDSLS) for a variety of galactomannans from native Brazilian flora. alpha-Galactosidase, which strips only the (1-6)alpha-D galactose side groups, and beta-mannanase, which hydrolyses only the (1-4)beta-D mannan main chain into oligosaccharides were investigated separately and in combination. The time-dependent signatures matched those describing side-chain stripping for galactosidase, whereas those resulting from the action of mannanase followed the signature typical of random backbone cleavage. Use of both enzymes together required that the TDSLS theory of polymer degradation be extended to the case where random backbone cleavage sites appear as side chains are stripped by the first enzyme. Whereas galactosidase allowed mannanase to access more backbone cleavage sites as time passes, leading to a higher degree of hydrolysis, there was no increase in rate constants. The distribution of random fragments in the case of mannanase digestion alone followed reasonably well the predictions for random cleavage of a single-strand polymer with a restricted number of cleavage sites. The fragment distributions were evaluated by size exclusion chromatography.",2001,11473348,no
Aspergillus fumigatus-induced allergic airway inflammation alters surfactant homeostasis and lung function in BALB/c mice.,"The differential regulation of pulmonary surfactant proteins (SPs) is demonstrated in a murine model of Aspergillus fumigatus (Af )-induced allergic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. BALB/c mice were sensitized intraperitoneally and challenged intranasally with Af extract. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis of serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels in these mice showed markedly increased total IgE and Af-specific IgE and IgG1. This was associated with peribronchial/perivascular tissue inflammation, airway eosinophilia, and secretion of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5 into the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Functional analysis revealed that in comparison with nonsensitized mice, allergic sensitization and challenge resulted in significant increases in acetylcholine responsiveness. To analyze levels of SPs, the cell-free supernate of the BALF was further fractionated by high-speed (20,000 x g) centrifugation. After sensitization and challenges, the pellet (large-aggregate fraction) showed a selective downregulation of hydrophobic SPs SP-B and SP-C by 50%. This reduction was reflected by commensurate decreases in SP-B and SP-C messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of the lung tissue of these animals. In contrast, there was a 9-fold increase in SP-D protein levels in the 20,000 x g supernate without changes in SP-D mRNA. The increased levels of SP-D showed a significant positive correlation with serum IgE (r = 0.85, P < 0.001). Tissue mRNA and protein levels of SP-A in either the large- or the small-aggregate fractions were unaffected. Our data indicate that allergic airway inflammation induces selective inhibition of hydrophobic SP synthesis accompanied by marked increases in the lung collectin SP-D protein content of BALF. These changes may contribute significantly to the pathophysiology of Af-induced allergic airway hyperresponsiveness.",2001,11472974,no
The Aspergillus nidulans carnitine carrier encoded by the acuH gene is exclusively located in the mitochondria.,"The location of the Aspergillus nidulans carnitine/acyl-carnitine carrier (ACUH) was studied. ACUH with a His-tag at its N-terminus was over-expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by Ni(2+) affinity chromatography. The purified protein was utilised to raise polyclonal antibodies which were characterised by Western blotting. For localisation studies A. nidulans T1 strain, that contains the acuH gene under control of the strong promoter alcA(p), was derived. Results obtained demonstrate the exclusively mitochondrial localisation of ACUH and therefore exclude the targeting of the acuH gene product to the peroxisomal membrane.",2001,11470361,no
"Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of a cytomegalovirus-specific monoclonal antibody (MSL-109) for prevention of cytomegalovirus infection after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","MSL-109 is a monoclonal antibody specific to the cytomegalovirus (CMV) glycoprotein H with high neutralizing capacity. In a prospective, randomized, double-blind study, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients with positive donor and/or recipient serology for CMV before transplantation received either 60 mg/kg MSL-109 (n = 59), 15 mg/kg MSL-109 (n = 60), or placebo (n = 60) intravenously every 2 weeks from day -1 until day 84 after transplantation. CMV pp65 antigenemia, CMV-DNA load in plasma, and viremia by culture were tested weekly. Primary end points were development of pp65 antigenemia at any level and/or viremia for which ganciclovir was given. There was no statistically significant difference in CMV pp65 antigenemia or viremia among patients in the 60-mg group (pp65 antigenemia, 47% viremia, 15%), the 15-mg group (52%",2001,11464977,no
The IsdA gene is necessary for sexual development inhibition by a salt in Aspergillus nidulans.,"Using one of 17 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) previously identified as specific to the late sexual developmental (LSD) stage of Aspergillus nidulans, a gene for the subject EST was isolated. The determined DNA sequences revealed an open reading frame encoding a 356 amino acid polypeptide which does not share a sequence similarity to previously identified genes or proteins. The isolated gene was named lsdA (late sexual development), since it was expressed abundantly at the LSD stage. The lsdA gene expression began earlier than at the LSD stage. Disruption of the lsdA gene in the veA+ background strongly induced sexual development under conditions where sexual development in wild-type strains is almost completely inhibited. In contrast, in the veA1 background, an lsdA null mutant failed to show any phenotypic difference in sexual development under the various conditions tested. These results indicate that the lsdA gene may be responsible for inhibiting the sexual development of veA+ strains by a high concentration of a salt.",2001,11453253,no
Central nervous system infections in the compromised host: a diagnostic approach.,"The diagnostic approach to the compromised host with CNS infection depends on an analysis of the patient's clinical manifestations of CNS disease, the acuteness or subacuteness of the clinical presentation, and an analysis of the type of immune defect compromising the patient's host defenses. Most patients with CNS infections may be grouped into those with meningeal signs, or those with mass lesions. Other common manifestations of CNS infection include encephalopathy, seizures, or a stroke-like presentation. Most pathogens have a predictable clinical presentation that differs from that of the normal host. CNS Aspergillus infections present either as mass lesions (e.g., brain abscess), or as cerebral infarcts, but rarely as meningitis. Cryptococcus neoformans, in contrast, usually presents as a meningitis but not as a cerebral mass lesion even when cryptococcal elements are present. Aspergillus and Cryptococcus CNS infections are manifestations of impaired host defenses, and rarely occur in immunocompetent hosts. In contrast, the clinical presentation of Nocardia infections in the CNS is the same in normal and compromised hosts, although more frequent in compromised hosts. The acuteness of the clinical presentation coupled with the CNS symptomatology further adds to limit differential diagnostic possibilities. Excluding stroke-like presentations, CNS mass lesions tend to present subacutely or chronically. Meningitis and encephalitis tend to present more acutely, which is of some assistance in limiting differential diagnostic possibilities. The analysis of the type of immune defect predicts the range of possible pathogens likely to be responsible for the patient's CNS signs and symptoms. Patients with diseases and disorders that decrease B-lymphocyte function are particularly susceptible to meningitis caused by encapsulated bacterial pathogens. The presentation of bacterial meningitis is essentially the same in normal and compromised hosts with impaired B-lymphocyte immunity. Compromised hosts with impaired T-lymphocyte or macrophage function are prone to develop CNS infections caused by intracellular pathogens. The most common intracellular pathogens are the fungi, particularly Aspergillus, other bacteria (e.g., Nocardia), viruses (i.e., HSV, JC, CMV, HHV-6), and parasites (e.g., T. gondii). The clinical syndromic approach is most accurate when combining the rapidity of clinical presentation and the expression of CNS infection with the defect in host defenses. The presence of extra-CNS sites of involvement also may be helpful in the diagnosis. A patient with impaired cellular immunity with mass lesions in the lungs and brain that have appeared subacutely or chronically should suggest Nocardia or Aspergillus rather than cryptococcosis or toxoplasmosis. Patients with T-lymphocyte defects presenting with meningitis generally have meningitis caused by Listeria or Cryptococcus rather than toxoplasmosis or CMV infection. The disorders that impair host defenses, and the therapeutic modalities used to treat these disorders, may have CNS manifestations that mimic infections of the CNS clinically. Clinicians must be ever vigilant to rule out the mimics of CNS infections caused by noninfectious etiologies. Although the syndromic approach is useful in limiting diagnostic possibilities, a specific diagnosis still is essential in compromised hosts in order to describe effective therapy. Bacterial meningitis, cryptococcal meningitis, and tuberculosis easily are diagnosed accurately from stain, culture, or serology of the CSF. In contrast, patients with CNS mass lesions usually require a tissue biopsy to arrive at a specific etiologic diagnosis. In a compromised host with impaired cellular immunity in which the differential diagnosis of a CNS mass lesion is between TB, lymphoma, and toxoplasmosis, a trial of empiric therapy is warranted. Antitoxoplasmosis therapy may be initiated empirically and usually results in clinical improvement after 2 to 3 weeks of therapy. The nonresponse to antitoxoplasmosis therapy in such a patient would warrant an empiric trial of antituberculous therapy. Lack of response to anti-Toxoplasma and antituberculous therapy should suggest a noninfectious etiology (e.g., CNS lymphoma). Fortunately, most infections in compromised hosts are similar in their clinical presentation to those in the normal host, particularly in the case of meningitis. The compromised host is different than the normal host in the distribution of pathogens, which is determined by the nature of the host defense defect. In compromised hosts, differential diagnostic possibilities are more extensive and the likelihood of noninfectious explanations for CNS symptomatology is greater.

Bioaerosol lung damage in a worker with repeated exposure to fungi in a water-damaged building.,"There has been increased concern over health effects related to potential exposure of building occupants to bioaerosols. We report the case of a worker with a respiratory illness related to bioaerosol exposure in a water-damaged building with extensive fungal contamination. We performed environmental tests to evaluate potential exposure to fungi, and we used mycotoxin-specific IgG antibody in serologic studies in the attempt to evaluate exposure to mycotoxins. Extensive fungal contamination was documented in many areas of the building. Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Stachybotrys species were the most predominant fungi found in air sampling. Our serologic test was not useful in differentiating workers who were probably occupationally exposed to mycotoxins from those who were not however, it did yield evidence that individuals may make specific IgG antibodies to macrocyclic tricothecene mycotoxins. Further research is needed concerning health effects related to bioaerosol exposures, particularly regarding markers of exposure to specific fungi that may produce mycotoxins. In the absence of clinical tools specific for evaluation of mycotoxin-related illness, a systematic clinical approach for evaluating persons with suspected building-related respiratory illness is warranted.",2001,11445520,no
Beta-galactofuranoside glycoconjugates on conidia and conidiophores of Aspergillus niger.,"Galactose in the furanoic conformation appears to be limited to bacteria and lower eukaryotes. Galactofuranoic (Galf)-containing glycoconjugates that occur in organisms pathogenic or allergenic to man are frequently antigenic and immunodominant. We have used an immunochemical approach, employing a monoclonal antibody that recognises Galf epitopes, to investigate the presence of Galf-containing glycoconjugates within conidia and conidiophores of Aspergillus niger. ELISA and immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that specific and saturable binding sites were found on both. Inhibition studies confirmed that this binding was to Galf-containing glycoconjugates. Interestingly, the conidiophore heads were particularly rich in these glycoconjugates. Western blotting identified a Galf glycoprotein of 150-200 kDa from disrupted conidia.",2001,11445162,no
Identification of a Hevea brasiliensis latex manganese superoxide dismutase (Hev b 10) as a cross-reactive allergen.,"Cross-reactive allergens play an increasingly important role in latex allergy in complicating both the diagnosis and time course of allergic symptoms. Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), a ubiquitous protein of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, was described as a cross-reactive allergen in Aspergillus fumigatus. Little information is available on the importance of this pan-allergen in Hevea brasiliensis latex. The aim of this study was to clone and express MnSOD from H. brasiliensis latex, and to obtain the soluble and immunologically active recombinant allergen for diagnosis of latex allergy and to investigate possible cross-reactivities with the structurally related A. fumigatus and human MnSODs.A complementary DNA coding for Hevea latex MnSOD was amplified by PCR. The recombinant protein was produced in Escherichia coli with an N-terminal hexahistidyl tag. Enzymatic activity of the recombinant protein was determined using an enzyme assay for SODs. IgE immunoblotting and IgE inhibition assays were performed to characterize the recombinant allergen and its cross-reactivity.A Hevea latex MnSOD consisting of 206 amino acid residues was cloned and expressed in E. coli. The allergen was designated Hev b 10. The recombinant protein was enzymatically active, indicating the correct folding of the protein. In immunoblots, latex- as well as A. fumigatus-allergic patients revealed IgE binding to recombinant (r)Hev b 10. Cross-reactivity to Asp f 6, the MnSOD from A. fumigatus, and human MnSOD was determined by inhibition of IgE binding to these MnSODs by rHev b 10.Hev b 10 is a new cross-reactive allergen of H. brasiliensis which belongs to the 'latex-mold' group of latex allergens. Furthermore, it is a candidate for primary sensitization in patients allergic to the pan-allergen MnSOD.",2001,11435728,no
Pneumonia in febrile neutropenic patients: radiologic diagnosis.,"Pneumonia in febrile neutropenic cancer patients should be diagnosed as early as possible, because prompt institution of targeted therapeutic measures might be essential for their prognosis. Conventional chest radiographs frequently fail to detect lung infiltrates at an early stage, meaning that a normal chest radiograph finding must be interpreted with caution. Thoracic computed tomograph scans provide a much higher yield and are therefore recommended in patients at risk for a complicated pulmonary infection. Lung infiltrates documented by computed tomograph scans (eg, nodular infiltrates with or without a halo, ground-glass opacities, or cavitations with or without air crescent signs) open up a wide range of differential diagnoses, such as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, other types of pneumonia, hemorrhage, infiltration by the underlying malignancy, drug toxicity, alveolar proteinosis, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. High-resolution techniques or magnetic resonance imaging may provide further details to help distinguish inflammatory processes from processes that may not require an antimicrobial intervention. Sequential nonculture-based monitoring for invasive fungal infections, using Aspergillus antigen sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and panfungal or Aspergillus-specific polymerase chain reaction, may add important tools in the early identification of patients who may benefit from systemic antifungal treatment.",2001,11429479,no
Antigen detection in the diagnosis and management of a patient with probable cerebral aspergillosis treated with voriconazole.,"This report describes the diagnosis and management of a 16-year-old boy who developed neurological signs and symptoms suggestive of cerebral aspergillosis following a haploidentical bone marrow transplant. A new sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of Aspergillus galactomannan circulating antigens (Platelia Aspergillus, Sanofi Diagnostic Pasteur, France) was used on serum and cerebrospinal fluid to obtain a presumptive diagnosis and to monitor the course of the disease. Having failed conventional therapy with amphotericin B, the patient received compassionate treatment with voriconazole for a period of 37 days. High levels of voriconazole were observed in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with a trend toward accumulation. After 7 days a marked improvement in the patient's neurological symptoms was noted, and ELISA data indicated a corresponding decrease in Aspergillus galactomannan levels in both serum and CSF. Voriconazole was well tolerated, with only transient increases in ALT/AST recorded during therapy. Although the patient survived the acute Aspergillus infection, he subsequently died of an unrelated infection.",2001,11429025,no
Microbiological diagnosis of invasive fungal infections in transplant recipients.,"Invasive fungal infections remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant recipients. Since conventional diagnostic tools such as culture lack sensitivity and specificity, alternative diagnostic assays have been developed. Among the most promising techniques are the detection of fungal DNA and serology. Fungal DNA can be detected with high sensitivity and specificity when performed with specimens from sterile sites such as blood. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays can be used to detect a broad range of fungal pathogens and combined with species identification. Multicenter diagnostic studies are needed to establish the diagnostic value of PCR but lack of standardization hampers such studies. The serodiagnosis of invasive fungal infections has become an important tool in the management of invasive fungal infections. Especially the detection of circulating galactomannan has been shown to be a sensitive marker for invasive aspergillosis. Both serology and PCR can be used to monitor the response to antifungal therapy. The optimal use of non-culture-based methods is in prospective screening of patients at high risk. Since the incidence of disease greatly influences the positive predictive value, screening should take place only in those patients at very high risk for invasive fungal disease.",2001,11429016,no
Approaches to fungal diagnosis in transplantation.,"The diagnosis of invasive fungal infection in patients undergoing solid organ or bone marrow transplantation remains a significant clinical challenge. Consideration of the epidemiology of these infections and host risk factors may be an important clue to a specific fungal diagnosis. Despite extensive investigation on methods such as serologic techniques to improve the rapid diagnosis of these infections, the diagnosis of invasive mycoses remains largely dependent on clinical presentation. For example, the signs and symptoms that result from angioinvasion of fungal organisms include pleuritic chest pain or hemoptysis. In a high-risk patient these findings can be important clues to invasive fungal infection. Cultures of opportunistic fungi in certain settings, such as Aspergillus in respiratory samples from immunosuppressed patients, may be associated with infection. Radiographic findings can also be useful to establish a diagnosis of infection. In patients with invasive aspergillosis as well as other angioinvasive moulds, chest CT scans may demonstrate lesions that are not visible on plain radiographs. Serodiagnosis of these infections remains largely investigational. Microbiological antifungal resistance has increasingly been reported, but in patients at high risk for serious fungal infection, including patients undergoing bone marrow and organ transplantation, antifungal resistance remains uncommon, particularly in Candida albicans. Higher doses of azoles should be used to treat patients with infections due to less susceptible yeasts and those with more serious infection. Prompt recognition of fungal infection combined with intensive antifungal therapy is needed for successful therapy.",2001,11428997,no
Cloning and expression of Aspergillus fumigatus allergen Asp f 16 mediating both humoral and cell-mediated immunity in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA).,"Aspergillus fumigatus, a ubiquitous fungus, is responsible for a number of lung disorders in atopic and non-atopic individuals. Standardized, pure, and relevant allergens are desirable for reliable immunodiagnosis of the disease and to understand the structural and functional properties of these allergens and the role they play in causing ABPA.Molecular cloning and characterization of a relevant allergen from A. fumigatus cDNA library.A cDNA library was constructed from 96 h old mycelium of A. fumigatus using lambda ZAP expression vector. A novel gene encoding an A. fumigatus allergen was identified by screening the library with sera from ABPA patients. The gene was cloned and the allergen over-expressed in Escherichia coli. This recombinant allergen, Asp f 16, was evaluated in ELISA and Western blots using sera from patients and normal subjects and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for antigen-induced stimulation.Seventy percent of the patients with ABPA demonstrated high levels of serum IgE antibodies to Asp f 16, a 43-kDa protein, whereas patients with allergic asthma, Aspergillus skin test-positive asthmatics without clinical evidence of ABPA, and normal controls failed to show Asp f 16-specific IgE binding by ELISA. The deduced amino acid sequences of Asp f 16 showed extensive sequence homology to 30.6-kDa Asp f 9 at the N-terminal region of the protein. PBMC from the majority of patients with ABPA exhibited significant proliferation with the recombinant Asp f 16 allergen.Specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses of Af-sensitized patients against Asp f 16 suggest its usefulness in the immunodiagnosis of hypersensitivity diseases due to Af and understanding the pathophysiology of ABPA.",2001,11422136,no
Grid-immunoblotting: a fast and simple technique to test multiple allergens with small amounts of antibody for cross-reactivity.,"Grid-immunoblotting is a procedure that allows the simultaneous testing of up to 20 different antibodies such as monoclonal antibody-containing hybridoma supernatants or human sera for specific antibodies to up to 20 different antigens or allergens on a single sheet of nitrocellulose membrane. Since only 150 to 200 microl of antibody-containing solution are required this technique is uniquely suited to test growing hybridomas and small amounts of sera (e.g. mouse and children's sera). Compared to a standard ELISA, approximately ten times less antibody is needed to obtain the same information.",2001,11419706,no
Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of reference strains of the genus Aspergillus.,"Twenty-five culture collection strains from four Aspergillus species (A. fumigatus n = 8, A. flavus n = 8, A. niger n = 4, A. nidulans n = 5) were characterized by four methods: (i) determination of patterns in an assimilation assay (ii) protein pattern of whole mycelial cell lysates in the sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)",2001,11413925,no
Allergy test results of a rural and small-city population compared with those of an urban population.,"The frequency of sensitization to environmental antigens changes in different regions. As such, the pattern of sensitivity to common allergens was studied at multiple sites across central Pennsylvania, an area composed of small cities and rural communities, to determine uniqueness of allergies in populations from this area in contrast to allergies as determined by skin testing in large urban centers. The study reported was undertaken to determine allergen variation from an urban population compared with a rural population of a Northeastern state so that environmental avoidance and immunotherapy can be more precisely prescribed. Patient charts were retrospectively reviewed to determine sensitivity to house dust mites (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae), cockroach, Penicillium, Aspergillus spp, dog, cat, timothy grass, ragweed, oak, and Alternaria tenuis at five sites in Pennsylvania. All of these sites were classified as ""small city"" or ""rural"" for the study. One hundred patient records were examined at each site for the results of allergy testing by the prick puncture, radioallergosorbent test (RAST), or intradermal methods. These small-city and rural data were pooled and compared with that of the National Cooperative Inner-City Asthma Study (NCI-CAS), which included 1286 patients from urban environments. The prevalence of allergy to both species of dust mites, dog, timothy grass, and ragweed was significantly greater in the pooled rural group than in the NCICAS inner-city patients (P < .05). In contrast, sensitivity to cockroach antigens and Alternaria was significantly greater in the NCICAS urban population than in the pooled rural group (P < .05). No statistically significant difference was found between the NCICAS and the pooled rural patients in reference to Penicillium, cat, and oak (P > .05).",2001,11409261,no
[Pneumonia in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Study of 30 episodes].,"To analyse the etiology, diagnostic methods and response to therapy in 30 episodes of pneumonia diagnosed in 17 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) between 1995 and 2000.In each episode of pneumonia the following data were analysed: age, gender, treatment of CLL, antiinfectious prophylaxis, granulocytopenia, CD4/CD8 lymphocytes ratio, hipogammaglobulinemia, origin of pneumonia (nosocomial or community-acquired), localisation, respiratory insufficiency, need for mechanical ventilation, antimicrobial therapy and response. Diagnostic methods included blood and sputum cultures, fiberoptic bronchoscopy and search for antigens in urine (Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, galactomannan, and Streptococcus pneumoniae).Median age of the series was 60 yr. (range 50-86) and 12 patients were male. Chlorambucil and prednisone were used in 13 cases and fludarabine in 8. Granulocytopenia was present in 14 episodes, hypogammaglobulinemia was seen in 22 and CD4/CD8 ratio was lower than 1 in 8 out of 14 evaluable cases. Etiology of pneumonia was established in 16 episodes (53%). Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was the most useful technique (83% of positive diagnoses) followed by blood cultures (38%). Two patients were diagnosed of aspergillosis at autopsy. Pneumococcus was the most frequent agent (5 cases) followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Pneumocystis carinii (2) and Aspergillus fumigatus (2). One out of the two patients with P. carinii pneumonia had received fludarabin and the remaining was treated with prednisone for long time. Ten patients (30%) had died: P. aeruginosa (3 cases), P. carinii (2), A. fumigatus (2), Mycobacterium xenopi (1), and unknown microorganism (2).In this series of CLL patients the frequency of etiologic diagnosis of pneumonias was good. Pneumococcus was the most frequent microorganism. Pneumonias caused by opportunistic microorganisms were associated to the treatment with fludarabin or prednisone and were associated to a high mortality rate.",2001,11412696,no
Production and properties of beta-mannanase by free and immobilized cells of Aspergillus oryzae NRRL 3488.,"Seven fungi were tested for production of mannanases. The highest mannanase activities were produced by Aspergillus oryzae NRRL 3488 after 7 days in static cultures. Mannanases were induced by gum locust bean (1.0%). The highest mannanase activity was produced when a mixture of peptone, urea and ammonium sulphate was used as nitrogen source. Zn2+ or Co2+ favoured enzyme production. The immobilized cells on Ca-alginate and agar were able to produce beta-mannanase for four runs with a slight decrease in the activity. The optimum temperature for enzyme reaction was 50-55 degrees C at pH 6.0. In the absence of substrate the enzyme was thermostable retaining 75% activity for 1 h at 50 degrees C, and 68% activity for 1 h at 60 degrees C.",2001,11393772,no
Allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis in patients with asthma: period prevalence at a university hospital in Saudi Arabia.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPM) is a known complication of asthma and can result in progressive lung damage, respiratory failure and death. Asthma is a common disease in Saudi Arabia and until now the prevalence of ABPM has not been investigated. The aim of this study was to estimate the period prevalence of ABPM due to Aspergillus and Candida in patients with asthma. The setting was an outpatient pulmonary clinic at a university hospital in the central region of Saudi Arabia. Two hundred and sixty-four consecutive patients with asthma (150 or 57% females) were evaluated. All patients were screened for ABPM with skin prick test (SPT) using a panel of fungal antigens. Those with positive skin reactions had further clinical, immunological, respiratory and radiological assessment. ABPM was diagnosed by the presence of a minimum of five of the major criteria suggested by Rosenberg in 1977. Of the 264 patients, 62 (23%) had a positive SPT for at least one fungal allergen, of whom 44 (71%) were females (P=0.01). Seven patients (six females) were diagnosed with ABPM due to Aspergillus and (or) Candida species. Therefore, we estimate the period prevalence of ABPM to be 2.7% (95% confidence interval 1.3-5.4%). A. niger was the commonest fungal species isolated in our group. In conclusion, ABPM is not uncommon in Saudi Arabia and females seem to be more at risk. Because asthma is common, physicians need to have high index of suspicion for this disease and pursue the diagnosis with the appropriate tests.",2001,11392574,no
[Present situation and problems in allergy testing in vitro].,"The present situation and problems related to in vitro assays for measurement of specific immunoglobulin E(IgE) are described. A comparison of four commercially available assay kits(CAP, AlaSTAT, MAST and QAS) revealed that of the allergens studied, common ragweed, mugwort and fungus(aspergillus, candida and alternaria) showed low correlation coefficients. The precise reason for this discordance is not clear, however, we speculated that difference in the origin and extraction method of allergens may affect the correlation results. Random between-the-lot-difference was noted: the results for egg white and milk in QAS showed differences of two classes, although the total imprecision expressed in CV(%) was less than 12% when only a single lot was tested. These results suggest that the specific IgE assay may need an improvement in reagents(approval of standard materials and establishment of standard procedures for allergen extraction) and careful daily quality control by the user.",2001,11391953,no
Molecular cloning and characterization of the fructooligosaccharide-producing beta-fructofuranosidase gene from Aspergillus niger ATCC 20611.,"The fopA gene encoding a fructooligosaccharide-producing beta-fructofuranosidase was isolated from Aspergillus niger ATCC 20611. The primary structure deduced from the nucleotide sequence showed considerable similarity to those of two other beta-fructofuranosidases from A. niger, but the fopA gene product had several amino acid insertions and an extra C-terminal polypeptide consisting of 38 amino acids that could not be found in the two others. We could successfully express the fopA gene in S. cerevisiae and the fopA gene product obtained from the culture supernatant of the S. cerevisiae transformant had similar characteristics to the beta-fructofuranosidase purified from A. niger ATCC 20611. However, we could not detect any beta-fructofuranosidase activity in either the culture supernatant or cell lysate when the C-terminal truncated fopA gene product by 38 amino acids was used to transform S. cerevisiae. In western analysis of those samples, there was no protein product that is cross-reacted with anti-beta-fructofuranosidase antibody. These results suggested that the C-terminal region of the fopA gene product consisting of 38 amino acids was essential for the enzyme production.",2001,11388451,no
Purification and characterisation of a galactoglucomannan from kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa).,"A galactoglucomannan (GGM) has been purified from the primary cell walls of ripe kiwifruit. A combination of barium hydroxide precipitation, anion exchange- and gel-permeation chromatography gave a chemically homogeneous polymer with a 1:2:2 galactose-glucose-mannose ratio and a molecular weight range of 16-42 kDa. Complete hydrolysis of the polymer with endo-1,4-beta-mannanase (EC 3.2.1.78) from Aspergillus niger gave a mixture of oligosaccharides, three of which (II, III, IV) accounted for more than 80% of the GGM. Structural characterisation of these oligosaccharides and the original polysaccharide was achieved by linkage analysis, 1D and 2D NMR spectrometry and enzymatic hydrolysis. Oligosaccharide II beta-D-Glcp-(1-->4)-beta-D-Manp-(1-->, III beta-D-Glcp-(1-->4)-[alpha-D-Galp-(1-->6)]-beta-D-Manp-(1-->, and IV beta-D-Glcp-(1-->4)-[beta-D-Galp-(1-->2)-alpha-D-Galp-(1-->6)]-beta-D-Manp-(1-->4)-beta-D-Glcp-(1-->4)-beta-D-Manp-(1-->, appeared in the molar ratio of 2:1:1. A trace amount of mannobiose (I) was detected, indicating that some of the mannosyl residues were contiguous. It is concluded that the predominant structural feature of kiwifruit GGM is a backbone of alternating beta-(1-->4)-linked D-glucopyranosyl and D-mannopyranosyl residues, with approximately one third of the latter carrying side-chains at 0-6 of single alpha-D-Galp-(1--> residues (50% of the branches) or the disaccharide beta-D-Galp-(1-->2)-alpha-D-Galp-(1--> (50% of the branches), the substituted residues being separated by three or five unsubstituted monosaccharide units.",2001,11383899,no
Production of beta-mannanase and beta-mannosidase from Aspergillus awamori K4 and their properties.,"beta-Mannanase and beta-mannosidase from Aspergillus awamori K4 was produced by solid culture with coffee waste and wheat bran. The optimum composition for enzyme production was 40% coffee waste-60% wheat bran. Two enzymes were partially purified. Optimum pH was about 5 for both enzymes, and optimum temperature was around 80 degrees C for beta-mannanase and 60-70 degrees C for beta-mannosidase. These enzymes produced some oligosaccharides from glucomannan and galactomannan by their hydrolyzing and transferring activities. beta-Mannanase hydrolyzed konjak and locust bean gum 39.1% and 15.8%, respectively. Oligosaccharides of various molecular size were released from glucomannan of konjak, but on the addition of cellulase, mannobiose was released selectively. In locust bean gum, tetra-, tri-, and disaccharides (mannobiose) were mainly released by K4 beta-mannanase. Tetra- and trisaccharides were heterooligosaccharides consisting of galactose and mannose residues. K4 beta-mannosidase had a transglycosylation action, transferring mannose residue to alcohols and sugars like fructose.",2001,11381326,no
Allergenic materials in the house dust of allergy clinic patients.,"Environmental agents including animal, fungal, tree, and weed antigens are known to cause allergic rhinitis and asthma. The following study was performed to measure the antigen concentration of several of these in house dust of children seen in an allergy clinic. Comparisons are made between household allergen levels of children seen for asthma and children seen for other reasons.Dust samples were solicited from patients in a pediatric allergy specialty clinic and other individuals associated with the clinic. Persons submitting dust were asked to complete a questionnaire describing their house. Samples were extracted, centrifuged, and filtered for sterility. Samples were stored in 50% glycerol at -20 degrees C. Specific antigens for Alternaria, Cladosporium, Aspergillus, Candida, Dermatophagoides farinae, cat, dog, oak, fescue, ragweed, plantain, and cockroach were measured using inhibition assays developed with whole antigen extract. Allergens Der p1, Der f 1, Alt a 1, and Alt a 70 kD were measured using double monoclonal antibody assays.Significant concentrations of whole antigen from cat, dog, oak, Alternaria, and Cladosporium were detected. Between 0.1 and 18 microg of Der f1 and Der p1 per gram of dust were also measured. Alt a 1 and Alt a 70 kD levels varied between 3.0 and 1000 U/g of dust. Significant positive correlations were observed in levels of dust mite and Alternaria allergen for patients with an evaluation of asthma.We found measurable levels of fungal antigens (Alternaria, Cladosporium), mite antigens, and animal antigens (dog and cat) in the majority of dust samples in this self-selected set of allergy clinic patients. Specific allergens Alt a 1, Alt a 70kD, and Der p 1 were significantly higher in the homes of asthmatic patients when compared with patients seen for reasons other than asthma. These studies support the hypothesis that fungal allergen exposure is an important component in the pathogenesis of the clinical condition known as asthma.",2001,11379802,no
Serologic evidence for Cryptococcus neoformans infection in early childhood.,"Cryptococcus neoformans is an important cause of central nervous system infection in adults with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) but an unusual cause of disease in children with AIDS. The basis for this age-related difference in incidence is not known but may be caused by differences in exposure or immune response. The objective of this study was to determine whether the low prevalence of cryptococcal disease among children is related to a lack of exposure to C neoformans.Sera were obtained from 185 immunocompetent individuals ranging in age from 1 week to 21 years who were being evaluated in an urban emergency department. Sera were analyzed for antibodies to C neoformans and Candida albicans proteins by immunoblotting. Immunoblot patterns were compared with those obtained from sera of patients with cryptococcosis (n = 10) and workers in a laboratory devoted to the study of C neoformans. The specificity of our results was confirmed by several approaches, including antibody absorption and blocking studies. Sera were also analyzed for the presence of cryptococcal polysaccharide by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and latex agglutination assays.Sera from children 1.1 to 2 years old demonstrated minimal reactivity to C neoformans proteins. In contrast, the majority of sera from children >2 years old recognized many (>/=6) C neoformans proteins. For children between 2.1 and 5 years old, 56% of sera (n = 25) reacted with many proteins, whereas for children >5 years old (n = 120), 70% of samples reacted with many proteins. Reactivity was decreased by absorbing sera with C neoformans extracts or by preincubating blots with sera from experimentally infected but not from control rats. Reactivity to C neoformans proteins did not correlate with reactivity to C albicans proteins, which was common in sera from children between the ages of 1.1 and 2 years. Cryptococcal polysaccharide was detected at a titer of 1:16 (~10 ng/mL) in the sera of 1 child, a 5.6-year-old boy who presented to the emergency department with vomiting.Our findings provide both indirect and direct evidence of C neoformans infection in immunocompetent children. Our results indicate that C neoformans infects a majority of children living in the Bronx after 2 years old. These results are consistent with several observations: the ubiquitous nature of C neoformans in the environment, including its association with pigeon excreta the large number of pigeons in urban areas",2001,11331716,no
Cloning and characterization of Aspergillus niger genes encoding an alpha-galactosidase and a beta-mannosidase involved in galactomannan degradation.,"Alpha-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.22) and beta-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.25) participate in the hydrolysis of complex plant saccharides such as galacto(gluco)mannans. Here we report on the cloning and characterization of genes encoding an alpha-galactosidase (AglC) and a beta-mannosidase (MndA) from Aspergillus niger. The aglC and mndA genes code for 747 and 931 amino acids, respectively, including the eukaryotic signal sequences. The predicted isoelectric points of AglC and MndA are 4.56 and 5.17, and the calculated molecular masses are 79.674 and 102.335 kDa, respectively. Both AglC and MndA contain several putative N-glycosylation sites. AglC was assigned to family 36 of the glycosyl hydrolases and MndA was assigned to family 2. The expression patterns of aglC and mndA and two other genes encoding A. niger alpha-galactosidases (aglA and aglB) during cultivation on galactomannan were studied by Northern analysis. A comparison of gene expression on monosaccharides in the A. niger wild-type and a CreA mutant strain showed that the carbon catabolite repressor protein CreA has a strong influence on aglA, but not on aglB, aglC or mndA. AglC and MndA were purified from constructed overexpression strains of A. niger, and the combined action of these enzymes degraded a galactomanno-oligosaccharide into galactose and mannose. The possible roles of AglC and MndA in galactomannan hydrolysis is discussed.",2001,11358516,no
[Role of computed tomography in pulmonary aspergillosis. 20 cases].,"Aspergilloma is the most common form of pulmonary aspergillosis. The purpose of this work was to compare computed tomographic findings with features observed on standard radiographs.We retrospectively reviewed 20 cases of pulmonary aspergilloma. These patients (mean age 36 years) were followed after cure of pulmonary tuberculosis and consulted for hemoptysis. All underwent computed tomography (CT) and standard radiographic explorations. Serology was positive for Aspergillus in 16 cases and clinical and radiographic findings led to the diagnosis in the 4 others. Both supine and prone positions were used for thoracic CT. Slice thickness was 5 mm without contrast injection.In many cases, standard films evidenced the typical mycetoma seen as a rounded mass of soft tissue density filling a portion of a preexisting cavity or as an air crescent sign, but atypical alveolar opacities, aeric images without aspergillosis colonization and parenchymal destruction predominated in certain cases. The CT-scan demonstrated these features even better revealing the typical cavity in 80% of the cases or an air crescent in 20%. Mobility of the fungus ball was demonstrated by comparison of the prone and supine images. The characteristic CT features allowed certain diagnosis of aspergilloma in 6 patients with atypical radiographic or serologic results.Computed tomography is highly contributive to the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis, particularly in case of small cavities that may be missed on the standard films. Recognition of the mobility of the fungal ball enables differentiation from a tumor or infectious lesion. CT is also helpful for guiding transparietal treatment.A computed tomography series should be obtained in former tuberculosis patients consulting for hemoptisis.",2001,11346899,no
Bizarre epithelial atypia of the sinonasal tract after chemotherapy.,"Certain chemotherapeutic agents can induce bizarre epithelial atypia. The lower respiratory tract is a frequently targeted site, but similar changes have not been described adequately in the sinonasal tract. Unfamiliarity with these changes could potentially cause confusion with an infectious or neoplastic process. All biopsies of the sinonasal tract at The Johns Hopkins Hospital were reviewed prospectively over a 54-month period. Eleven cases with bizarre atypia of the respiratory epithelium formed the basis of this study. The medical records of these patients were reviewed. The specimens were from 11 patients who had previously undergone chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation for acute myelocytic leukemia (n = 5), multiple myeloma (n = 3), acute lymphocytic leukemia (n = 2), and chronic myelocytic leukemia (n = 1). Although the chemotherapy regimens were highly variable, all included one or more of the alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, n = 11 busulfan, n = 5",2001,11342778,no
Use of recombinant mitogillin for improved serodiagnosis of Aspergillus fumigatus-associated diseases.,"During human infection, Aspergillus fumigatus secretes a 18-kDa protein that can be detected as an immunodominant antigen in the urine of infected patients. Recently, this protein was shown to be mitogillin, a ribotoxin that cleaves a single phosphodiester bond of the 29S rRNA of eukaryotic ribosomes. We proved the immunogenic capacity of mitogillin in a rabbit animal model, indicating its usefulness as an antigen for serological diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. The mitogillin gene from A. fumigatus was transferred from plasmid pMIT+ to expression vector pQE30 and expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein. Purified recombinant mitogillin was recognized by serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) of polyclonal rabbit sera that were obtained by immunization with purified native mitogillin. Consequently, we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies to recombinant mitogillin.

Detection of moulds producing aflatoxins in maize and peanuts by an immunoassay.,"An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to detect moulds producing aflatoxins in maize and peanuts by an antibody produced to extracellular antigen from Aspergillus parasiticus. This antibody recognized species with phenotypic similarities to A. parasiticus, A. flavus and the domesticated species A. sojae and A. oryzae. For maize samples that were naturally contaminated with aflatoxins, low and high levels of aflatoxin corresponded with low and high ELISA readings for mould antigens, respectively. Maize and peanuts inoculated with 10(2) spores ml(-1) of A. parasiticus and incubated at 15 degrees C for 18 days or 21 degrees C for 7 days were analyzed for mould antigens and aflatoxin levels. At 15 degrees C, mould antigens were detected by day 4 in maize when 0.16 ng g(-1) of aflatoxin was detected by ELISA but not by thin layer chromatography (TLC). Antigens were detected in peanuts by day 4 before aflatoxin was found. Likewise, at 21 degrees C, antigens were detected by day 4 in maize when less than 1 ng g(-1) of aflatoxin was detected by ELISA but not by TLC, but by day 2 in peanuts when no aflatoxin was detected. A. parasiticus could be detected before it could produce aflatoxins. Therefore, this ELISA shows potential as an early detection method for moulds that produce aflatoxins.",2001,11322698,no
Induction of cytotoxicity and production of inflammatory mediators in raw264.7 macrophages by spores grown on six different plasterboards.,"Dampness and microbial growth in buildings are associated with respiratory symptoms in the occupants, but details of the phenomenon are not sufficiently understood. The current study examined the effects of growth conditions provided by six plasterboards on cytotoxicity and inflammatory potential of the spores of Streptomyces californicus, Penicillium spinulosum, Aspergillus versicolor, and Stachybotrys chartarum. The microbes were isolated from mold problem buildings and thereafter grown on six different plasterboards. The spores were harvested, applied to RAW264.7 macrophages (10(4), 10(5), 10(6) spores/10(6) cells), and evaluated 24 h after exposure for the ability to cause cytotoxicity and to stimulate production of nitric oxide (NO), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The data indicate clear differences between spores of different microbes in their ability to induce the production of these inflammatory mediators and to cause cell death in macrophages. Also, for each microbe, the induction ability specifically depended on the brand of plasterboard. The spores of Streptomyces californicus collected from all plasterboards were the most potent at inducing NO and cytokine production. Cytotoxicity caused by P. spinulosum and Streptomyces californicus spores was consistent with NO, IL-1beta and IL-6 production induced by those microbes. However, the production of these inflammatory mediators by the spores of Stachybotrys chartarum was not parallel to their ability to cause cell death. The low productions of NO and cytokines were associated with high cytotoxicity caused by the spores of the A. versicolor. These data suggest that growth condition of microbes on different plasterboards affect the ability of microbial spores to induce inflammatory responses and cytotoxicity in macrophages.",2001,11295859,no
"Quantitation of the major fungal allergens, Alt a 1 and Asp f 1, in commercial allergenic products.","Alternaria is one of the most important fungi associated with allergic disease, whereas Aspergillus fumigatus is involved in a broad spectrum of pulmonary diseases. Currently, fungal extracts used for diagnosis in the United States are unstandardized, and their allergenic content cannot be compared directly.The goal of this study was to compare the variability of major allergen levels among US allergenic products derived from fungi: specifically, Alt a 1 levels in Alternaria alternata extracts, and Asp f 1 levels in A fumigatus extracts.A novel 2-site monoclonal antibody ELISA was used for measuring Alt a 1 using recombinant Alt a 1 as a standard. Asp f 1 was also measured by ELISA. Allergenic products produced by 8 US manufacturers over a 2-year period were compared, as were multiple lots produced by a single company.Alt a 1 levels in Alternaria extracts from 8 companies produced in 1998 and 1999 ranged from less than 0.01 to 6.09 microg/mL (mean 1.4 +/- 1.6 microg/mL, n = 15). In general, Alt a 1 levels were consistent within and between companies (1.4 +/- 1.1 microg/mL, n = 27), with 21 of 32 (66%) of all extracts tested containing 0.7 to 2 microg/mL Alt a 1. Aspergillus extracts showed much greater variability in Asp f 1 levels, with extracts from 8 companies containing from less than 0.1 to 64 microg/mL Asp f 1 (mean 16.3 +/- 23.9 microg/mL, n = 15). Overall variability was greater for Aspergillus products within and between manufacturers (22 +/- 22 microg/mL Asp f 1, n = 20).ELISA-based assays for specific allergens showed greater consistency among allergenic products derived from Alternaria than from Aspergillus. These assays should facilitate improved quality control and standardization of fungal allergen extracts and lead to the development of more consistent products for clinical use.",2001,11295652,no
Pathogenic yeasts Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans produce immunomodulatory prostaglandins.,"Enhanced prostaglandin production during fungal infection could be an important factor in promoting fungal colonization and chronic infection. Host cells are one source of prostaglandins however, another potential source of prostaglandins is the fungal pathogen itself. Our objective was to determine if the pathogenic yeasts Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans produce prostaglandins and, if so, to begin to define the role of these bioactive lipids in yeast biology and disease pathogenesis. C. neoformans and C. albicans both secreted prostaglandins de novo or via conversion of exogenous arachidonic acid. Treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors dramatically reduced the viability of the yeast and the production of prostaglandins, suggesting that an essential cyclooxygenase like enzyme may be responsible for fungal prostaglandin production. A PGE series lipid was purified from both C. albicans and C. neoformans and was biologically active on both fungal and mammalian cells. Fungal PGE(x) and synthetic PGE(2) enhanced the yeast-to-hypha transition in C. albicans. Furthermore, in mammalian cells, fungal PGE(x) down-modulated chemokine production, tumor necrosis factor alpha production, and splenocyte proliferation while up-regulating interleukin 10 production. These are all activities previously documented for mammalian PGE(2). Thus, eicosanoids are produced by pathogenic fungi, are critical for growth of the fungi, and can modulate host immune functions. The discovery that pathogenic fungi produce and respond to immunomodulatory eicosanoids reveals a virulence mechanism that has potentially great implications for understanding the mechanisms of chronic fungal infection, immune deviation, and fungi as disease cofactors.",2001,11292712,no
Identification of continuous B-cell epitopes on the protein moiety of the 58-kiloDalton cell wall mannoprotein of Candida albicans belonging to a family of immunodominant fungal antigens.,"The 58-kiloDalton mannoprotein (mp58) on the surface of Candida albicans is highly immunogenic, is expressed by all C. albicans isolates tested, and elicits strong antibody responses during candidiasis. It belongs to a family of immunodominant fungal antigens with representatives also in different species of Aspergillus. The amino acid sequence of the protein portion of mp58 as deduced from the DNA sequence of its encoding gene (FBP1/PRA1) was used to synthesize a complete set of overlapping dodecapeptides (overlap, 7 offset, 5) covalently attached to the surface of derivatized polyethylene pins. The pin-coupled peptides were used in a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to identify continuous epitopes recognized by a number of antiserum preparations containing anti-mp58 antibodies. This comprehensive epitope-scanning study revealed the presence of multiple immunoreactive continuous B-cell epitopes within the protein sequence. Regions of increased reactivity included both the amino and carboxy termini of the mature protein (encompassing amino acid residues 16 to 50 and 286 to 299, respectively) and four internal regions spanning amino acids at positions 66 to 92, 121 to 142, 148 to 192, and 211 to 232. Further delineation of epitopic regions and identification of the boundaries of the antigenic sites was performed upon ELISA testing with a second Pepset consisting of completely overlapping 8-mer peptides spanning these reactive regions in the protein moiety of mp58. The highly reactive epitopic region at the C terminus of the protein was further evaluated using both window net and replacement net analyses. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the last 10 amino acid residues at the C terminus of the protein was immunogenic when injected into mice after being coupled to a carrier protein. Moreover, antibodies in the resulting sera specifically recognized the homologous mp58 in ELISAs and immunoblot assays. Delineation of the antibody responses to mp58 could provide the basis for the development of novel immunity-based prophylactic, therapeutic, and diagnostic techniques for the management of candidiasis.",2001,11292706,no
High-level secretory production of phospholipase A1 by Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus oryzae.,"Phospholipase A1 (PLA1) is a hydrolytic enzyme that catalyzes the removal of the acyl group from position 1 of lecithin to form lysolecithin. The PLA1 gene, which had been cloned from Aspergillus oryzae, was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and A. oryzae. Through the modification of the medium composition and the feeding conditions of substrate, the production level of PLA1 by S. cerevisiae was increased to a level fivefold higher than that indicated in a previous report. In the case of A. oryzae, introduction of multicopies of PLA1 expression units, and the morphological change from the pellet form to the filamentous form were effective for the enhancement of PLA1 production. We succeeded in producing 3,500 U/ml of PLA1 using an industrial-scale fermentor.",2001,11272851,no
The Drosophila caspase Dredd is required to resist gram-negative bacterial infection.,"The Drosophila innate immune system discriminates between pathogens and responds by inducing the expression of specific antimicrobial peptide-encoding genes through distinct signaling cascades. Fungal infection activates NF-kappaB-like transcription factors via the Toll pathway, which also regulates innate immune responses in mammals. The pathways that mediate antibacterial defenses, however, are less defined. We have isolated loss-of-function mutations in the caspase encoding gene dredd, which block the expression of all genes that code for peptides with antibacterial activity. These mutations also render flies highly susceptible to infection by gram-negative bacteria. Our results demonstrate that Dredd regulates antibacterial peptide gene expression, and we propose that Dredd, Immune Deficiency and the P105-like rel protein Relish define a pathway that is required to resist gram-negative bacterial infections.",2001,11269502,no
Identification of vacuolar serine proteinase as a major allergen of Aspergillus fumigatus by immunoblotting and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis.,"Aspergillus species are common airborne fungi that have been identified as causative agents of extrinsic bronchial asthma. More than 10 allergens from A. fumigatus have been recently characterized by cDNA cloning. The objective of this study is to identify A. fumigatus allergens through immunoblot analysis using sera from asthmatic patients. IgE-binding components of A. fumigatus and IgE cross-reactivity among allergens of different prevalent airborne fungal species were analysed by immunoblot and immunoblot inhibition, respectively, using sera from asthmatic patients. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of major allergens identified were determined by Edman degradation. Among two batches (70 and 41 sera) of asthmatic sera tested, 19 (27%) and 14 (34%), respectively, have IgE immunoblot reactivity towards components of A. fumigatus. A 34-kDa protein that reacts with IgE antibodies in 15 (79%) and 11 (79%) of the 19 and 14 positive samples, respectively, may be considered a major allergen of A. fumigatus. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the 34 kDa major allergen and the 30.5 and 30 kDa IgE-binding components of A. fumigatus showed sequence identity to that of the vacuolar serine proteinase from A. fumigatus. The results from immunoblot inhibition show IgE cross-reactivity among major allergens of A. fumigatus, P. notatum and P. oxalicum. Results obtained suggest that the 34 kDa major allergen of A. fumigatus may be a vacuolar serine proteinase. There is IgE cross-reactivity among serine proteinase allergens of A. fumigatus, P. notatum and P. oxalicum.",2001,11251631,no
The antioxidant system beta-D(+) glucose-glucose oxidase-catalase: tests for pyrogenicity and antigenicity.,"beta-D(+) glucose-glucose oxidase (E.C.# 1.1.3.4)-catalase (E.C.# 1.11.1.6) (GO-CAT) is being investigated as a new antioxidant system for use in pharmaceutical solutions. This study reports the results of tests for pyrogenicity and antigenicity of GO-CAT derived from Aspergillus niger when used parenterally in autoclaved preparations.The Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) method was used to test the pyrogenicity of native GO-CAT. Pyrogenicity/antigenicity was evaluated in vivo by injecting autoclaved GO-CAT into New Zealand white rabbits. Antigenicity was also evaluated by Ouchterlony and Western blotting.None of the native GO-CAT concentrations tested (up to 30.83 u/ml) produced a positive gel clot in the LAL test, thereby suggesting its non-pyrogenicity. The rabbits, which received seven injections of autoclaved GO-CAT over a period of eleven weeks, remained healthy during and after the GO-CAT injections. All Ouchterlony and Western blot assays using sera from rabbits injected with autoclaved GO-CAT were negative. Furthermore, autoclaved GO-CAT could not be detected in Ouchterlony assays using a mouse monoclonal antibody (GO40 mAb) to native A. niger glucose oxidase. Control samples containing native GO-CAT produced an antigen-antibody complex reaction in Ouchterlony assays against the GO40 mAb. Antigen-antibody complexes could be detected by non-denaturing PAGE in samples containing native GO-CAT/GO40 and boiled GO-CAT/GO40, but not in samples containing autoclaved GO-CAT/GO40. These results indicate autoclaved GO-CAT is neither pyrogenic nor antigenic.Based on these results, there is potential for the use of beta-D(+) glucose-glucose oxidase-catalase as an antioxidant system in pharmaceutical solutions, particularly in terminally autoclaved aqueous formulations for parenteral use.",2001,11247273,no
Ambient pH signaling regulates nuclear localization of the Aspergillus nidulans PacC transcription factor.,"The Aspergillus nidulans zinc finger transcription factor PacC is activated by proteolytic processing in response to ambient alkaline pH. The pH-regulated step is the transition of full-length PacC from a closed to an open, protease-accessible conformation. Here we show that in the absence of ambient pH signaling, the C-terminal negative-acting domain prevents the nuclear localization of full-length closed PacC. In contrast, the processed PacC form is almost exclusively nuclear at any ambient pH. In the presence of ambient pH signaling, the fraction of PacC that is in the open conformation but has not yet been processed localizes to the nucleus. Therefore, ambient alkaline pH leads to an increase in nuclear PacC by promoting the proteolytic elimination of the negative-acting domain to yield the processed form and by increasing the proportion of full-length protein that is in the open conformation. These findings explain why mutations resulting in commitment of PacC to processing irrespective of ambient pH lead to permanent PacC activation and alkalinity mimicry. A nuclear import signal that targets Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase to the nucleus has been located to the PacC zinc finger region. A mutation abolishing DNA binding does not prevent nuclear localization of the processed form, showing that PacC processing does not lead to nuclear localization by passive diffusion of the protein made possible by the reduction in size, followed by retention in the nucleus after DNA binding.",2001,11238906,no
Screening for circulating galactomannan as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for invasive aspergillosis in prolonged neutropenic patients and stem cell transplantation recipients: a prospective validation.,"The diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in patients with hematologic disorders is not straightforward lack of sensitive and specific noninvasive diagnostic tests remains a major obstacle for establishing a precise diagnosis. In a series of 362 consecutive high-risk treatment episodes that were stratified according to the probability of IA based on recently accepted case definition sets, the potential for diagnosis of serial screening for circulating galactomannan (GM), a major aspergillar cell wall constituent was validated. After incorporating postmortem findings to allow a more accurate final analysis, this approach proved to have a sensitivity of 89.7% and a specificity of 98.1%. The positive and negative predictive values equaled 87.5% and 98.4%, respectively. False-positive reactions occurred at a rate of 14%, although this figure might be overestimated due to diagnostic uncertainty. More or less stringent criteria of estimation could highly influence sensitivity, which ranged from 100% to 42%",2001,11238098,no
"NudE-L, a novel Lis1-interacting protein, belongs to a family of vertebrate coiled-coil proteins.","The LIS1-encoded protein (Lis1) plays a role in brain development because a hemizygous deletion or mutation of the human gene causes neuronal migration disorders, such as Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS) or isolated lissencephaly sequence (ILS). Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have isolated a novel protein that interacts with mouse Lis1 (mLis1) which is termed mouse NudE-like protein (mNudE-L) because of its 49% amino acid conservation with NudE, a protein involved in nuclear migration in Aspergillus nidulans. GST pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation of fusion proteins expressed in mammalian cells confirmed the interaction of mLis1 and mNudE-L. mNudE-L gives rise to a approximately 2.3 kb mRNA and encodes an ORF corresponding to approximately 38 kDa protein. The overall amino acid sequence of mNudE-L is 49-95% identical to proteins found in a variety of organisms, thus establishing mNudE-L as a new member of a protein family. The hallmark of this family is an N-terminal region predicted to form a coiled-coil domain. We show that mNudE-L and mLis1 are coexpressed in the postnatal and adult cerebral cortices and in the Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum. In contrast to mLis1, mNudE-L transcripts are absent in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb and in the inward migrating granular neurons of the developing cerebellum. Mutant mLis1 proteins modelling mutations found in human lissencephaly patients fail to interact with mNudE-L, raising the possibility that phenotypic changes result, in part, from the inability of mutant Lis1 proteins to interact with the human NudE-L polypeptide.",2001,11231056,no
An overview of fungal infections.,"The incidence of fungal infections is increasing at an alarming rate, presenting an enormous challenge to healthcare professionals. This increase is directly related to the growing population of immunocompromised individuals, resulting from changes in medical practice such as the use of intensive chemotherapy and immunosuppressive drugs. HIV and other diseases which cause immunosuppression have also contributed to this problem. Superficial and subcutaneous fungal infections affect the skin, keratinous tissues and mucous membranes. Included in this class are some of the most frequently occurring skin diseases, affecting millions of people worldwide. Although rarely life threatening, they can have debilitating effects on a person's quality of life and may in some circumstances spread to other individuals or become invasive. Most superficial and subcutaneous fungal infections are easily diagnosed and readily amenable to treatment. Systemic fungal infections may be caused by either an opportunistic organism that infects an at-risk host, or may be associated with a more invasive organism that is endemic to a specific geographical area. Systemic infections can be life threatening and are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Because diagnosis is difficult and the causative agent is often confirmed only at autopsy, the exact incidence of systemic infections is difficult to determine. The most frequently encountered pathogens are Candida albicans and Aspergillus spp. but other fungi such as non-albicans Candida spp. are increasingly important.",2001,11219546,no
[Assay for determination of the serum procalcitonin level: biochemical and clinical evaluation].,"In patients with inflammatory conditions such as infection, cytokines induce the production of C-reactive protein(CRP) and serum amyloid A protein(SAA) in hepatic cells. It has been reported that upon viral infection, the serum SAA level increases by a greater degree than the serum CRP level. Procalcitonin (PCT), the precursor of calcitonin, is a new type of inflammatory marker that is specifically induced by bacterial infection, sepsis and lethal multiple organ failure, but not by viral infection, autoimmune diseases, tumors or surgical stress. To evaluate the immunoluminometric assay(LUMI test PCT Brahms Diagnostics, Berlin, Germany) procedure for determining the PCT level and to study the clinical significance of the serum PCT level, we determined the serum levels of PCT, CRP and SAA in patients with various inflammatory diseases and normal subjects. The serum PCT level in the normal subjects was < 0.3 ng/ml. Among the patients with inflammatory disease who had a high CRP level(CRP > 20000 micrograms/dl), the PCT level was elevated only in those patients with severe bacterial infection. These results suggest that determining the PCT level may be useful in the differential diagnosis of severe bacterial infection. The patients who had a low CRP level(CRP < 150 micrograms/dl), had a PCT level within the normal range. The patients with autoimmune disease, viral infection, and fungal infection did not have an elevated PCT level.",2001,11215485,no
Aspergillus antigenemia sandwich-enzyme immunoassay test as a serodiagnostic method for invasive aspergillosis in liver transplant recipients.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is an important cause of mortality in liver transplant patients. Clinical and microbiological diagnosis is difficult, and it is frequently achieved only after autopsy. Early diagnosis and antifungal therapy could improve the survival of these patients.A retrospective case-control study of IA in liver transplant recipients (OLT) was performed to determine the value of the detection of galactomannan Aspergillus antigen in serum using a sandwich-ELISA test (Platelia, Sanofi Diagnostic Pasteur). Stored frozen serum specimens obtained during the posttransplantation period were used.Fourteen cases of IA were diagnosed in 240 OLT recipients (IA incidence: 5.8%) during 5 years with 13 deaths (mortality: 93%). Nine case patients and 33 control patients met the criteria required for being considered ""valid"" for antigenemia analysis. In five of the nine case patients, a serum sample was positive for Aspergillus antigenemia detection. The median value was 5.7 ng/ml (range: 1.6-6.6). Sensitivity of the test was 55.6%, specificity was 93.9%, the positive predictive value was 71.4%, and the negative predictive value was 88.6%. The likelihood ratio of a positive test was 9.2.Galactomannan detection in serum could be useful for an early diagnosis of IA in OLT recipients.",2001,11211181,no
Exploring infection of wheat and carbohydrate metabolism in Mycosphaerella graminicola transformants with differentially regulated green fluorescent protein expression.,"A Mycosphaerella graminicola strain transformed with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) downstream of either a carbon source-repressed promoter or a constitutive promoter was used to investigate in situ carbohydrate uptake during penetration of the fungus in wheat leaves. The promoter region of the acu-3 gene from Neurospora crassa encoding isocitrate lyase was used as a carbon source-repressed promoter. The promoter region of the Aspergillus nidulans gpdA gene encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a constitutive promoter. Fluorometric measurement of GFP gene expression in liquid cultures of acu-3-regulated transformants indicated that the N. crassa acu-3 promoter functions in M. graminicola as it does in N. crassa, i.e., acetate induced and carbon source repressed. Glucose, fructose, and saccharose triggered the repression, whereas mannitol, xylose, and cell wall polysaccharides did not. Monitoring the GFP level during fungal infection of wheat leaves revealed that acu-3 promoter repression occurred after penetration until sporulation, when newly differentiated pycnidiospores fluoresced. The use of GFP transformants also allowed clear visualization of M. graminicola pathogenesis. No appressoria were formed, but penetration at cell junctions was observed. These results give new insight into the biotrophic status of M. graminicola.",2001,11204778,no
Invasive aspergillosis.,"Acute invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a devastating disease. Early diagnosis allowing an early treatment may improve the prognosis. However, this goal remains difficult to achieve. When diagnosis is confirmed it is often already too late. Galactomannan antigen detection and DNA detection are under clinical evaluation to improve early diagnosis and management of treatment. Despite antifungal treatment mortality rate is still high. Clinical resistance is more often due to the intensity of immunodepression than to high minimum inhibitory concentrations to antifungal agents however, resistance to itraconazole may occur in rare instances. Beside acute IA, a chronic form of this infection may be seen as chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis or chronic invasive sinusitis. Other sites of infection have been described. The patients are immunocompetent or present minor alteration of their immunity or of anatomic structure of the infected site. Among patients with solid organ transplantation, lung and liver transplant patients are at the highest risk of developing IA. A high degree of awareness and efforts for an early diagnosis may participate to improve the poor prognosis.",2001,11204148,no
Non-culture based diagnostic tests for mycotic infections.,"Non-culture methods being developed and evaluated for mycotic infections include polymerase chain reaction (PCR), galactomannan (GM) antigenemia, Western blot (WB) to detect antibodies, and detection of the fungal metabolites D-arabinitol and (1,3)-beta-D-glucan. Sample preparation for PCR from blood specimens depends on fractionation of peripheral blood, its pre-incubation in blood culture broth, or a total DNA method, which does not rely on fractionation, or pre-incubation. Targets for PCR of fungi in the 18S or ITS2 subunits of the ribosomal RNA genes facilitated the design of Aspergillus and Candida genus and species probes. Amplicons were identified using PCR-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or reverse line-blot formats. A pilot study indicated that PCR tests on blood specimens were positive at least once in patients with confirmed invasive aspergillosis (IA). When serum-PCR and serum-GM tests were compared in IA patients, antigenemia was more often positive. PCR detected Aspergillus DNA in bronchoalveolar lavage specimens from patients at risk even when cultures were negative. D-Arabinitol can be detected as a marker of candidiasis with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or enzyme dependent-fluorometry. Each method can differentiate the microbial D- and host L-enantiomers. (1,3)-beta-D-Glucan is produced by most genera of pathogenic fungi and can be detected in plasma by the 'G-test'. In patients with febrile neutropenia the efficacy of azole therapy correlated with plasma (1,3)-beta-D-glucan concentrations of > or = 10 pg ml(-1). The diagnosis of early acute pulmonary histoplasmosis can be improved by a WB test utilizing deglycosylated M antigen, a 94-kDa glycoprotein. The identity of M antigen as a catalase was deduced from the sequence of the cloned gene. PCR identification of Histoplasma capsulatum cultures was accomplished with primer pairs selected from H and M antigen gene sequences.",2001,11204140,no

Value of antigen detection using an enzyme immunoassay in the diagnosis and prediction of invasive aspergillosis in two adult and pediatric hematology units during a 4-year prospective study.,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a well recognized, life-threatening infection in neutropenic patients and stem cell transplantation recipients. Early diagnosis is important to achieve the best outcome for these patients however, definite proof often is difficult to obtain due to counterindicated invasive procedures.This study evaluated the specificity and sensitivity of the detection of galactomannan (GM) for the diagnostic and prediction of IA in 347 children from the Pediatric Hematology Service and 450 patients from the Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit at the Hôpital Saint-Louis in Paris. Serial screening of Aspergillus GM circulating antigen was evaluated using a double sandwich ELISA assay (Platelia Aspergillus) on 6209 sera. Among the patients studied, 53 presented with confirmed IA (n = 27 patients) or probable IA (n = 26 patients).Antigen was detected on at least two sequential sera in 48 of 53 patients, with a sensitivity of 90.6%. GM antigenemia was detected before the onset of radiologic signs in 31 of 48 patients (64.6%), with a mean of -8.4 days, and before clinical symptoms in 18 of 48 patients (39.6%), with a mean of -6.9 days. In patients without IA, 44 of 744 had positive antigenemia, resulting in a specificity of 94%. False positive results could not be related to the presence of a concurrent mucositis.This large, prospective study allowed the authors to define better the conditions for the use of GM immunocapture ELISA in surveying patients who are at high risk for IA. The presence of antigen has a good diagnostic value mainly when there is an increase in the titer on two consecutive sera samples. A repeated negative result is a strong argument against the diagnosis of IA however, an awareness of the possibility of unexplained false negative results is important.",2001,11180076,no
Relationships of immunoglobulins E and G sensitization to respiratory function in dairy farmers.,"An impairment of respiratory function has been demonstrated in dairy farmers. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship of allergy to respiratory function in dairy farmers in a longitudinal study conducted in the Doubs (France). A cohort of male dairy farmers constituted in 1990 was re-evalued in 1995. Subjects completed a medical and occupational questionnaire, and a spirometry test in both 1990 and 1995, in 1995 they were also subjected to immunological tests. Relationships between immunological variables and respiratory function were studied by a multiple linear regression model adjusted for age, smoking status, respiratory symptoms, altitude and occupational exposure. Amongst the 394 subjects of the initial cohort, 330 were included in the longitudinal study and 320 had immunological tests. Log immunoglobulin (Ig) E was negatively correlated with the 1995 respiratory function parameters (p<0.05 for forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and FEV1/vital capacity (VC). Immunoglobulin (Ig) G response to Aspergillus fumigatus detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was negatively correlated to 1995 respiratory function parameters (VC: p<0.01 FEV1: p<0.001",2001,11153588,no
Pds5 cooperates with cohesin in maintaining sister chromatid cohesion.,"Sister chromatid cohesion depends on a complex called cohesin, which contains at least four subunits: Smc1, Smc3, Scc1 and Scc3. Cohesion is established during DNA replication, is partially dismantled in many, but not all, organisms during prophase, and is finally destroyed at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. A quite separate protein called Spo76 is required for sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis in the ascomycete Sordaria. Spo76-like proteins are highly conserved amongst eukaryotes and a homologue in Aspergillus nidulans, called BimD, is required for the completion of mitosis. The isolation of the cohesin subunit Smc3 as a suppressor of BimD mutations suggests that Spo76/BimD might function in the same process as cohesin.We show here that the yeast homologue of Spo76, called Pds5, is essential for establishing sister chromatid cohesion and maintaining it during metaphase. We also show that Pds5 co-localizes with cohesin on chromosomes, that the chromosomal association of Pds5 and cohesin is interdependent, that Scc1 recruits Pds5 to chromosomes in G1 and that its cleavage causes dissociation of Pds5 from chromosomes at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition.Our data show that Pds5 functions as part of the same process as cohesin. Sequence similarities and secondary structure predictions indicate that Pds5 consists of tandemly repeated HEAT repeats, and might therefore function as a protein-protein interaction scaffold, possibly in the cohesin-DNA complex assembly.",2001,11137006,no
The human homologue of the Aspergillus nuclear migration gene nudC is preferentially expressed in dividing cells and ciliated epithelia.,"We recently identified a novel human gene, HnudC, homologous to an Aspergillus nidulans gene coding for a protein crucial to nuclear migration, cell wall morphogenesis, and cell growth. While mRNA for this gene is expressed in most tissues, HNUDC protein expression is highly regulated. To provide insight into the function of this protein, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of the distribution of HNUDC in 19 different human tissues. Intense immunolabeling was observed in proliferating cells, including spermatocytes at all stages, early hematopoietic cells, cortical thymocytes, immunoblasts, and basal colonic and esophageal mucosa. Within a given tissue, cells with different proliferative capacities demonstrated different levels of HNUDC expression. HNUDC was also highly expressed in ciliated epithelia including those found in ependyma, bronchial mucosa, and fallopian tubes. Immunolabeling was moderate in several non-proliferating tissues, but little or no labeling was observed in most other tissues examined. We also demonstrated by western blotting that most cell lines express extremely high levels of HNUDC compared to their normal counterparts. While this supports a role for HnudC in cell proliferation, these data indicate that cell lines are not a reliable measure of HNUDC protein expression in normal tissues. We conclude that HNUDC is highly expressed in cell lines and the proliferating cells of normal tissues, consistent with our hypothesis that HNUDC is conserved throughout evolution for a crucial function in cell division. In addition, the high level in ciliated cells suggests an important role in ciliary motility or assembly, analogous to its role in A. nidulans nuclear movement.",2000,11131094,no
On the galactosyl distribution of commercial galactomannans.,"A simple method was developed that enabled the enzymatic determination of the galactose distribution in galactomannans. endo-Mannanase of Aspergillus niger was used to degrade the galactomannan polymers and the degradation products were determined with high-performance anion-exchange chromatography. A whole range of commercial high-to-low substituted galactomannans was analyzed in this way. It was found that differences in the anion-exchange chromatograms reflected dissimilarities in the distribution of galactose and could be used directly to discern these dissimilarities. The differences among the various elution profiles were used to construct a similarity distance tree. In addition to this approach, the absolute amount of non-substituted mannose released by the enzyme was found to be a good discriminating factor. In this way, galactomannans with regular, blockwise, and randomly distributed galactose could be discerned. All guars and the highly substituted gum of Prosopis juliflora were found to have a blockwise distribution of galactose. For different batches of tara gum both random and blockwise distributions were found. Among batches of locust bean gum the greatest variation was observed: both random, blockwise, and ordered galactose distributions were present. Cassia gum was found to have a highly regular distribution of galactose.",2000,11128589,no
Fungal atopy in adult cystic fibrosis.,"This study set out to estimate the prevalence of atopy to a variety of common ubiquitous fungi, including A. fumigatus, in cystic fibrosis (CF), and to evaluate the investigations by which the diagnosis was made. Particular attention was paid to the usefulness of skin testing and immunoassays in detecting which patients had simple fungal atopy, and which patients were at high risk of developing allergic bronchopulmonary mycoses. This cross-sectional study included 21 adult CF patients and 20 matched controls. Serum samples were taken for the measurement of total serum IgE and specific serum IgE to nine common fungi. Immediate hypersensitivity skin prick testing to each of the fungi was also performed. Simple fungal atopy was described in subjects fulfilling the following criteria: total serum IgE > 100 KU l(-1) with specific radioimmunoassay > or = grade 1 to at least one fungus and a positive skin prick test (SPT) > or = 3 mm to the same fungus. 'High risk' for developing allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPM) was described in subjects fulfilling the following criteria: total serum IgE > 200 KU l(-1) with specific radioimmunoassay > or = grade 2 to at least one fungus and a positive skin prick test (SPT) > or = 6 mm to the same fungus. The adult CF group had a significantly higher total SPT score (P=0.005) and mean total serum IgE (P<0.05) than controls. Forty-three percent of CF patients fulfilled the criteria for fungal atopy to at least a single fungus. Over half this group had an atopic tendency to more than one fungus. Nineteen percent of the CF group were at least 'high risk' of developing ABPM. Skin prick testing is a better marker of fungal atopy and a better predictor of those adult CF patients at higher risk of developing ABPM than specific radioimmunoassay serum testing. There is a high prevalence of fungal atopy in the adult CF population. Total serum IgE and skin prick testing are good predictors of fungal atopy and help predict those at risk of developing ABPM in CF.",2000,11127497,no
Anti-nidatory effect of vaginally administered fumagillin in the rhesus monkey.,"In the present study, fumagillin, which is an antibiotic with potent angiostatic activity secreted from Aspergillus fumigatus was administered intravaginally during peri-implantation stage in the rhesus monkey and its effects on ovarian function, blastocyst implantation and pregnancy outcome in the rhesus monkey were investigated. Female monkeys (n = 18) showing normal menstrual cycles were vaginally inserted with tampons containing fumagillin (0 mg/animal in group 1 1 mg/animal in group 2",2000,11124364,no
Cutaneous and paranasal aspergillosis in an immunocompetent patient.,"A 26-year-old Libyan woman presented with asymptomatic nodulo-ulcerative skin lesions present for 1 year. Three years prior to presentation, she had experienced a nasal discharge followed by the development of a nodule in the nasal cavity and a plaque on the hard palate. These lesions had gradually increased in size and ulcerated, resulting in perforation of the nasal septum and palate. Two years later, the patient noticed the appearance of skin lesions: a nodule on the right thumb and numerous nodulo-ulcerative lesions on the extremities. General physical examination was normal with no significant lymphadenopathy. Examination of the oral cavity revealed perforation of the distal nasal septum, with a perforated nodular plaque involving the entire palate, associated with subluxation of the upper incisors (Fig. 1a). On skin examination, multiple firm nodules and nodulo-ulcerative lesions with a central eschar and raised margins were observed. The lesions ranged in size from 0.5 to 5 cm and were distributed on the right hand and fingers, left upper arm (Fig. 1b), left calf, and right thigh. Routine laboratory investigations (liver function tests, serum calcium, electrolytes, lipid profile, urine and stool culture studies) were normal. Immunoelectrophoresis disclosed normal levels of immunoglobulins IgG, IgA, and IgM. Serologic studies for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and syphilis, and a tuberculin test, were all negative. A Giemsa-stained tissue smear was negative for Leishmania tropica organisms. Radiological studies disclosed a slight haziness of the maxillary sinuses with perforation of the nasal septum. A chest X-ray was normal. Histopathologic examination of biopsies taken from both the palate and from ulcerated and nonulcerated skin lesions was performed, and all showed similar findings. The biopsy of a nonulcerated skin lesion showed pseudoepitheliomatous epidermal hyperplasia with neutrophilic microabscesses (Fig. 2a). A dermal diffuse and nodular granulomatous mixed infiltrate of lymphocytes, histiocytes, giant cells, numerous eosinophils, and neutrophilic microabscesses was seen in all tissues examined. Septate hyphae were present both within giant cells and free in the dermis (Fig. 2b). The hyphae were branching at a 45 degrees angle and were positive on periodic acid-Schiff and Grocott methenamine silver stains (Fig. 2c). Fungal culture studies of material taken from an ulcerated skin lesion grew Aspergillus flavus. Blood cultures were negative for Aspergillus sp. or other microorganisms. The patient was treated with intravenous amphotericin B, but the medication was discontinued due to her intolerance to the drug. She was subsequently lost to follow-up.",2000,11123449,no
Multiple forms of the serine protease Alp of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Alkaline proteases were produced by a virulent strain of Aspergillus fumigatus during growth on media containing glucose and proteins or peptides. After isoelectric focusing, six bands of proteolytic activity were detected with synthetic substrates after blotting on nitrocellulose membranes. The main protease (pI = 8.6) corresponded to the known subtilisin-like protease Alp of A. fumigatus and five minor components had lower isoelectric points (8.1 to 5.2). All proteases were produced on different media and in various phases of growth with only small quantitative variations. They also had identical pH optima, were denatured above 45 degrees C and stabilized by Ca2+ ions, were affected by the inhibitors of serine proteases only and had nearly identical substrate specificity against 13 synthetic substrates. On gel chromatography the three most acidic components had higher molecular weights than the main enzyme Alp. It remains to be determined if the enzymes under study arise through posttranslational processing of the main protease or are true isoenzymes, products of a gene family.",2000,11105537,no
Development of surface plasmon resonance-based immunoassay for aflatoxin B(1).,"Aflatoxins are a group of highly toxic fungal secondary metabolites that occur in Aspergillus species and may contaminate foodstuffs and feeds. Two different anti-aflatoxin B(1) antibodies were examined to develop a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based immunoassay to aflatoxin B(1). A conjugate consisting of aflatoxin B(1)-bovine serum albumin (BSA) was immobilized on the dextran gel surface. Competition between immobilized aflatoxin B(1) conjugate and free aflatoxin B(1) in solution for binding to antibody injected over the surface formed the basis for the assay. Regeneration of the antibody from the immobilized conjugate surface is essential for the development of such an inhibitive immunoassay. Problems were encountered with the regeneration of the sensor surface, due to the high-affinity binding of the antibodies. Conventional regeneration solutions consisting of low concentrations of NaOH and HCl worked to a degree, but regeneration was at the expense of the integrity of the immobilized conjugate. A polyclonal anti-aflatoxin B(1) antibody was produced and was found to be regenerable using an organic solution consisting of 1 M ethanolamine with 20% (v/v) acetonitrile, pH 12.0. This combined high ionic strength and extreme pH, as well as chaotrophic properties and allowed the development of an inhibitive immunoassay. The assay had a linear range of 3.0-98.0 ng mL(-1) with good reproducibility.",2000,11087443,no
Characterization of chicken antisera raised against Aspergillus spp. by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.,"Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays of three Aspergillus species have been developed. Laying hens were immunized with the exoantigens from Asp. flavus, Asp. ochreaus and Asp. versicolor. All test chickens except for one produced antisera raised against the exoantigens. The antisera production process and ELISA titer were analysed. Fourteen days after the first injection, the antisera began to produce largely, on the 35th day reached to the peak, and maintained a stable level until the 42nd day. The maximum ELISA titer of the antisera to the exoantigens from Asp. flavus, Asp. ochreaus and Asp. versicolor was 1:8,000, 1:10,000 and 1:10,000, respectively. The cross-reactivities of antisera were determined with seventeen species of Aspergillus, ten species of fungi from other genera and the buffer-extracts of grain. The antisera did not cross-react with the exoantigens from other genera and the buffer-extracts of grain. The antiserum to exoantigen from Asp. ochreaus was species-specific, whereas the antisera against Asp. flavus and Asp. versicolor tended to cross-react with other Aspergillus species to varying degrees. The results suggest that exoantigens immunoassays can be developed to indentify and detect Aspergillus genus in grains.",2000,11075373,no
Production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies to serine proteinase allergens in Penicillium and Aspergillus species.,"Alkaline and/or vacuolar serine proteinases are major allergens in prevalent airborne Penicillium and Aspergillus species.The object of this study is to generate and characterize monoclonal antibodies against these serine proteinase allergens.BALB/c mice were immunized individually with the Penicillium citrinum culture medium or the crude extract and culture medium preparations of Aspergillus fumigatus. Hybridoma cells that secrete monoclonal antibodies against serine proteinase allergens were selected by immunoblotting. Antigens in three different Penicillium (P. citrinum, P. notatum and P. oxalicum) and two different Aspergillus species (A. fumigatus, and A. flavus) recognized by these monoclonal antibodies were analysed by sodium dodecyl sulphate and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis immunoblotting and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis.Four (PCM8, PCM10, PCM16 and PCM39) and one (FUM20) monoclonal antibodies against serine proteinase allergens were generated after fusion of NS-1 cells with spleen cells obtained from BALB/c mice immunized with antigens from P. citrinum and A. fumigatus, respectively. Immunoblotting results showed that PCM8 reacted with an alkaline serine proteinase allergen in P. citrinum and P. notatum. PCM10 and PCM39 reacted with the alkaline serine proteinase in two Penicillium (P. citrinum, P. notatum) and two Aspergillus species (A. fumigatus, and A. flavus) tested. PCM16 reacted with the alkaline serine proteinase allergen in P. citrinum, A. fumigatus and A. flavus but not with that in P. notatum. MoAb FUM20 reacted with the alkaline serine proteinase allergen in two Aspergillus species (A. fumigatus and A. flavus) but not with that in two different Penicillium species (P. citrinum, P. notatum) tested. Among these five monoclonal antibodies generated, only PCM39 and FUM20 can react with the vacuolar serine proteinase allergen in P. notatum, P. oxalicum and in A. fumigatus. The 35 kDa P. citrinum component that reacted with FUM20 has an N-terminal amino acid sequence of DSPSVEKNAP.Five monoclonal antibodies against different epitopes of the serine proteinase major allergens in prevalent Penicillium and Aspergillus species were generated in the present study. Antibodies obtained may be useful in the characterization and standardization of serine proteinase allergens in crude fungal extracts.",2000,11069576,no
"Aspergillus antigen in serum, urine and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens of neutropenic patients in relation to clinical outcome.","We have used a new, commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, Platelia Aspergillus) to detect Aspergillus antigen in serum, urine and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples of 105 haematological patients who received empirical amphotericin B treatment for suspected fungal infection. 14% (60/419) of serum and 5% (18/373) of urine samples were positive. Ten-fold concentration of urine increased the number of positive samples to 31 (8%). The antigen was detected in 5 of 20 BAL samples, but fungal culture was negative in all of them. 22 patients had positive antigen test. Serum was positive in 17, urine in 7 and concentrated urine in 12 patients. Six patients had confirmed invasive aspergillosis. In all these patients, antigen was detected in serum, but urine was positive in only 2 patients. Patients whose antigen test turned negative during the amphotericin B treatment had significantly lower mortality than patients with persistently positive antigen test (2/10 vs. 8/8, p = 0.002). We conclude that Aspergillus galactomannan can be detected by ELISA in serum, urine and BAL samples of haematological patients, but the higher sensitivity of serum testing makes it preferable for screening. Disappearance of the antigen during antifungal therapy seems to correlate with good, and persistence with poor, clinical outcome.",2000,11055651,no
Febrile neutropenia: antifungal prophylaxis.,"Despite being widely practised there is little or no evidence to support the use of antifungal prophylaxis in febrile nuetropenic patients. With the greater recognition of risk factor, the increasing readiness to use imaging techniques such as the high-resolution CT scan and new methods for detecting fungi such as Aspergillus galactomannan on the one hand and the widening choice of drugs on the other hand, it may be possible to move away from prophylaxis towards preemptive treatment when the prevalence of fungal disease is low. However, the case still has to be proven convincingly by conducting formal clinical trials.",2000,11053793,no
Primary pulmonary mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma with associated fungal ball in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus infection.,"We describe a case of primary mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma of the lung in a 44-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus.

The gross, histologic, and molecular features of this unusual case are described.",2000,11035584,no
Isolation and serological analyses of fungal melanins.,"Melanins are notoriously difficult to work with because of their unique physical and chemical properties. The study of melanins is hampered by the scarcity of melanin-specific reagents and serological techniques. In this study we describe modifications to the standard method for the isolation of melanins from in vitro-melanized fungal cells and detail the optimization of serological techniques for the study of melanin compounds. The isolation procedure involves the digestion of melanized cells with a combination of proteolytic and glycolytic enzymes, denaturant, organic extractions, and boiling in 6.0 M HCl. Elemental quantitative analyses suggest that this procedure does not significantly affect the relative elemental composition of melanins. For the serological assays, our goal was to achieve a homogenous distribution of melanin particles on a solid support to maximize their recognition by melanin-binding antibodies. The results from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) demonstrate that melanins, in general, disperse more efficiently on, and adhere better to, medium-binding polystyrene surfaces, especially in the presence of trace amounts of salt. Blocking the melanin-coated ELISA plates with the commercially available SuperBlock((R)) Blocking Buffer for 4 h was more efficient at reducing non-specific binding of a negative control monoclonal antibody (mAb) compared to blocking with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 5% milk. Increasing the ionic strength of the antibody solutions reduced binding to the melanins, indicating that binding is in part mediated by electrostatic interactions. These conditions were also applied to immunofluorescence (IF) analyses of melanins, and the results were consistent with those obtained by ELISA.",2000,11033020,no
[Chronic septic granulomatosis in a young girl manifesting as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and flaccid paraplegia].,"The invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis (IPA) is the principal cause of death in patients with chronic granulomatosis disease (CGD).

Marker antigens to assess exposure to molds and their allergens. I. Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Exposure to molds and mold products in the indoor environment may lead to allergies, asthma, or respiratory complaints in general. Enumeration of viable parts of molds in the environment is insufficient to estimate exposure. Therefore, other methods have to be developed.Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) was grown under various circumstances (22 degrees C and 30 degrees C, high and low water activity) in the laboratory. At various moments during culture, extracts were taken, and antigen and allergen content was examined by acrylamide electrophoresis and immunoblot.In extracts of the culture filtrate, two antigens were found to be produced under all studied growth conditions (common antigens). In the extracts of the water-soluble portion of the mycelium, one common antigen was found.The three common antigens may serve as marker antigens for exposure to Af and its products. In view of the simultaneous presence of two of these common antigens with Af allergens, these two marker antigens may be used to estimate exposure to allergens of Af.",2000,11003449,no
A glucoamylase::GFP gene fusion to study protein secretion by individual hyphae of Aspergillus niger.,"Although Aspergillus niger is used as a host for heterologous protein production, yields are generally lower than those obtained for homologous proteins. Mechanisms of protein secretion and the secretory pathway in filamentous fungi are poorly characterised, although there is evidence to suggest that secretion occurs by a mechanism similar to that in other eukaryotes, but with proteins destined for secretion being directed to the hyphal tip. We report on a method using a glucoamylase: GFP gene fusion which allows us for the first time to monitor, in vivo, protein secretion in A. niger at the single hyphal level. A synthetic green fluorescent protein (sGFP(S65T)) was fused to truncated A. niger glucoamylase (GLA:499). Southern blot analysis of transformants confirmed that the gene fusion had successfully integrated into the A. niger genome. Confocal and fluorescence microscopy revealed that the GLA::GFP fusion protein is fluorescent in A. niger and appears to be directed to the hyphal tip. In young mycelia, hyphal cell wall fluorescence is apparent and immunogold labelling of GFP confirmed that GFP was partially localised within the hyphal cell wall. Using Western blotting, extracellular GLA::GFP was detected only in culture filtrates of young mycelia grown in a soya milk medium. The actin inhibitor latrunculin B was used to disrupt the secretion process, and its effects on the distribution of GLA::GFP were monitored.",2000,11000429,no
Coccidioidomycosis as imported atypical pneumonia in Sweden.,"Coccidioidomycosis, an endemic fungal infection of the western hemisphere causes serious disease in immunocompromised individuals.

[Chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis and ankylosing spondylarthritis].,"Fibro-bullous disease is a late complication of ankylosing spondylarthritis. Its radiologic features frequently mimics tuberculosis or excavated neoplasm. About 50 to 65% of patients with ankylosing spondylarthritis have chronic aspergillus colonization of their airways. Pulmonary aspergillosis infection occurs in 10 to 30% during evolution. We report two cases of patients with spondylarthritis who developed chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis. Diagnosis was based on serology, mycologic examination of expectoration and in one case on histology obtain by transbronchial biopsies. Pulmonary complications due to aspergillus species frequently reveal an associated fibro-bullous disease in patients with ankylosing spondylarthritis. This can be reported to diminished chest wall movements in such patients. Treatment is based on administration of anti-fungal drugs. In case of medical treatment failure, thoracic surgery may be indicated.",2000,10951964,no
Identification of copper ligands in Aspergillus oryzae tyrosinase by site-directed mutagenesis.,"Copper ligands of the recombinant tyrosinase from the fungus Aspergillus oryzae expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Escherichia coli were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. The recombinant protyrosinases expressed in S. cerevisiae were assayed for catalytic activities of mono-oxygenase and L-dopa oxidase at pH 5.5 after acid shock at pH 3.0. Replacements of His-63, His-84, His-93, His-290, His-294, His-332 or His-333 with asparagine resulted in mutant enzymes exhibiting no activities. The site-directed mutant Cys82Ala showed that Cys-82 was also an essential residue for the activity. We obtained homogeneous preparations of activated tyrosinases from mutated thioredoxin fusion gene products expressed in E. coli by acid shock. The copper contents of engineered mutants and wild-type enzyme expressed in E. coli were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The wild-type enzyme contained 2 g-atoms of copper/mol of the subunit. The His63Asn, His84Asn, His93Asn, His290Asn, His294Asn, His332Asn, His333Asn or Cys82Ala substitution decreased copper binding by approx. 50%, indicating that the mutants contain only approx. 1 g-atom of copper/mol of the subunit. The five mutants His63Asn, His93Asn, His290Asn, His294Asn and Cys82Ala contain only one copper ion, which is fully detectable by EPR. From the correlation of g( parallel) and (Cu)A( parallel), we deduced that the nitrogen or sulphur donors in the copper ligands should be in a square or a distorted tetrahedral geometric environment. In further atomic absorption spectrophotometry experiments, no copper atom was observed in the seven double mutants His63Asn/His290Asn, His63Asn/His294Asn, His63Asn/His332Asn, His63Asn/His333Asn, Cys82Ala/His290Asn, His84Asn/His333Asn and His93Asn/His290Asn. We propose a new structure of active sites of tyrosinase from A. oryzae: the most likely binding sites of tyrosinase for Cu(A) are His-63, His-84 and His-93, with the remaining conserved Cys-82 providing the fourth ligand. Cu(B) liganded by four histidine residues, His-290, His-294, His-332 and His-333, is identified as new binding motif of Cu(B).",2000,10947969,no
New type of starch-binding domain: the direct repeat motif in the C-terminal region of Bacillus sp. no. 195 alpha-amylase contributes to starch binding and raw starch degrading.,"The alpha-amylase from Bacillus sp. no. 195 (BAA) consists of two domains: one is the catalytic domain similar to alpha-amylases from animals and Streptomyces in the N-terminal region the other is the functionally unknown domain composed of an approx. 90-residue direct repeat in the C-terminal region. The gene coding for BAA was expressed in Streptomyces lividans TK24. Three active forms of the gene products were found. The pH and thermal profiles of BAAs, and their catalytic activities for p-nitrophenyl maltopentaoside and soluble starch, showed almost the same behaviours. The largest, 69 kDa, form (BAA-alpha) was of the same molecular mass as that of the mature protein estimated from the nucleotide sequence, and had raw-starch-binding and -degrading abilities. The second largest, 60 kDa, form (BAA-beta), whose molecular mass was the same as that of the natural enzyme from Bacillus sp. no. 195, was generated by proteolytic processing between the two repeat sequences in the C-terminal region, and had lower activities for raw starch binding and degrading than those of BAA-alpha. The smallest, 50 kDa, form (BAA-gamma) contained only the N-terminal catalytic domain as a result of removal of the C-terminal repeat sequence, which led to loss of binding and degradation of insoluble starches. Thus the starch adsorption capacity and raw-starch-degrading activity of BAAs depends on the existence of the repeat sequence in the C-terminal region. BAA-alpha was specifically adsorbed on starch or dextran (alpha-1,4 or alpha-1,6 glucan), and specifically desorbed with maltose or beta-cyclodextrin. These observations indicated that the repeat sequence of the enzyme was functional in the starch-binding domain (SBD). We propose the designation of the homologues to the SBD of glucoamylase from Aspergillus niger as family I SBDs, the homologues to that of glucoamylase from Rhizopus oryzae as family II, and the homologues of this repeat sequence of BAA as family III.",2000,10947962,no
[The role of fungal allergy in bronchial asthma].,"Fungus is known to be one of the causative allergens inducing bronchial asthma as are housedustmites, pollen and pet dander. Outdoor airborne fungi such as Cladosporium, Alternaria, Penicillium and Aspergillus are important inducing IgE antibody formation. In addition to these common fungi, the indoor fungi Aspergillus restrictus, Neurospora and Eurotium are important allergenic fungi which have recently been identified. The yeast Candida albicans, is a common commensal of the human oral and vaginal mucosae and gastrointestinal tract and part of the normal flora, is known as one of the main allergens causing bronchial asthma. We examined the allergenicity of mannan (Mn) as a cell-wall constituent and acid protease (CAAP) as a secreted enzyme of C. albicans. We previously reported cases of atopic asthma caused by CAAP and stressed the role of CAAP as an important allergen in mucosal allergy to C. albicans 9). The levels of the antibodies to these antigens in the sera of asthmatic patients who showed positive immediate intradermal response to crude C. albicans (n=86) were measured. Anti-Mn IgE and IgG antibody levels were measured by liquid-phase assay (AlaSTAT). Anti-CAAP and anti-crude C. albicans IgE and IgG antibody levels were measured by RAST and AlaSTAT. Anti-Mn A and anti-Mn B IgE antibody titers were strongly correlated (r=0.87), while anti-Mn A and anti-CAAP IgE titers were not correlated. However, all of the anti-Mn A IgE positive sera and all of the anti-CAAP IgE positive sera were positive for IgE to crude-C. albicans. This indicates that both Mn and CAAP are C. albicans-related allergens. Titers of IgG antibodies to Mn A and crude C. albicans were highly correlated (r=0. 90). Results of inhibition assays performed using other fungal antigens as inhibitors showed that Mn is a cross reactive allergen among different fungi and that CAAP is a C. albicans specific allergen causing human mucosal allergic reaction.",2000,10938515,no
Expression of glucose oxidase by using recombinant yeast.,"The glucose oxidase gene (GO) of Aspergillus niger was cloned into the yeast shuttle vector YEp352 with combinations of various promoters and terminators, and then used to transform Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Expressed GO was successfully secreted into culture medium due to the presence of the intrinsic signal peptide of GO. Four different promoters fused to GO were tested: bidirectional galactose dehydrogenase 1 and 10 (GAL1, GAL10) promoters, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) promoter and an yeast hybrid ADH2-GPD promoter consisting of alcohol dehydrogenase II (ADH2) and GPD promoter. The intrinsic terminator of GO as well as the GAL7 terminator were also compared for better production of GO. Deletion of most of the terminating region from GO yielded only a slight amount of GO while the presence of either terminator greatly increased GO production. The GAL10 promoter produced the least amount of GO, GAL1 and GPD promoters were moderate, and the ADH2-GPD hybrid promoter was the best among all tested. However, the hybrid promoter was tightly regulated by the presence of an excess amount of either glucose or ethanol, and it appeared that 2% glucose and 1. 5% ethanol supplement was the best concentration for GO production. It was possible to produce 260 IU ml(-1) of GO, an equivalent of 5 g l(-1), under the presence of 2% glucose and 1.5% ethanol. UV mutagenesis of a recombinant S. cerevisiae was also applied and it further increased the yield of GO to 460 IU ml(-1) under the presence of 2% glucose and 1.5% ethanol without any changes in cell growth. Corn steep liquor which is commonly used in bioindustry is a good alternative substrate for high priced glucose for the hybrid promoter and suggests a cost effective means for commercial mass production of GO using recombinant yeast.",2000,10936658,no
Simple and rapid detection of Candida albicans DNA in serum by PCR for diagnosis of invasive candidiasis.,"A rapid and sensitive PCR assay for the detection of Candida albicans DNA in serum was established. DNA from human serum samples was purified using the QIAamp blood kit, which proved to be a fast and simple method for isolating minute amounts of Candida DNA from clinical specimens for diagnosis of invasive candidiasis. Universal primer sequences used in the PCR assay are derived from the internal transcribed spacer rRNA gene of fungi, whereas the biotinylated hybridization probe used in a DNA enzyme immunoassay (DEIA) binds specifically to C. albicans DNA. The sensitivity of this PCR-DEIA method is very high the detection limit for genomic Candida DNA is one C. albicans genome per assay. Blood from uninfected and infected persons, ranging from healthy volunteers, patients with mucocutaneous infections, and patients at risk to develop a systemic Candida infection to patients with an established systemic candidiasis, was analyzed for the presence of C. albicans to diagnose fungal infection. Candida DNA could not be detected in sera of 16 culture-negative controls and from 11 nonsystemic candidal infections by PCR or DEIA. Blood cultures from patients at risk were all negative for Candida, whereas all blood cultures from systemic candidiasis patients were positive. However, Candida DNA could be detected by PCR and DEIA in the serum from three out of nine patients who were at risk for a systemic infection and in the serum of all seven patients who had already developed an invasive Candida infection. PCR is more sensitive than blood culture, since some of the patients at risk for invasive yeast infection, whose blood cultures were all negative for Candida, tested positive in the PCR amplification. These results indicate the potential value of PCR for detecting C. albicans in serum samples and for identifying patients at risk for invasive candidiasis.",2000,10921970,no
Molecular biology and immunology of fungal allergens.,"Fungi are non-chlorophyllus microorganisms, which constitutes the main source of outdoor and indoor allergens. The antigens present in the spores and fragments of hyphae induce allergic responses in sensitized patients. The frequently recognized fungi associated with asthma include Alternaria, Cladosporium, Aspergillus, and Penicillium. With the advent of molecular biology techniques a number of fungal genes encoding relevant allergens have been cloned and the expressed allergens purified and characterized. In this review, we have presented the recent developments, where recombinant allergens have been used in the precise diagnosis of fungal allergy. We have also discussed the role played by these allergens and the T- and B-cell epitopes in the immune mechanism in fungal allergy.",2000,23105266,no
Ultrasonication of pyrogenic microorganisms improves the detection of pyrogens in the Mono Mac 6 assay.,"The monocytic cell line Mono Mac 6 is sensitive to pyrogens. When exposed to pyrogens secretion of interleukin-6 is induced. However, some eukaryotic pyrogenic microorganisms are not detectable. The aim of this study is to introduce a pretreatment of samples to expand the detection range of the assay. The interleukin-6 inducing capacity of a broad spectrum of UV-killed and ultrasonicated microorganisms is examined in Mono Mac 6 cells. The interleukin-6 secretion is determined in a sandwich immunoassay (DELFIA). The Mono Mac 6 assay is able to detect UV-killed Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhimurium, but neither Candida albicans nor Aspergillus niger. After ultrasonication of the microorganisms it is possible to detect C. albicans and A. niger. The interleukin-6 inducing ability of the examined microorganisms is in no case reduced after ultrasonic treatment. However, ultrasonication of S. aureus results in a 100-fold increase in the interleukin-6 response. Even after ultrasonication Streptococcus faecalis can not be detected. Ultrasonication is an easy and simple method for expanding the detection range in the Mono Mac 6 assay.",2000,10913753,no
SPECT thallium-201 combined with Toxoplasma serology for the presumptive diagnosis of focal central nervous system mass lesions in patients with AIDS.,"To determine the utility of brain thallium-201 single photon emission computerized tomography (Tl-201 SPECT) combined with Toxoplasma serology for the diagnosis of focal CNS lesions in patients with AIDS.Sixty-one consecutive HIV-infected patients with focal CNS lesion(s) on head computed tomography (CT) or MRI scan who underwent brain Tl-201 SPECT and serum Toxoplasma serology were evaluated, retrospectively. Thallium-201 uptake ratios were calculated by comparing lesion activity to contralateral scalp activity. Diagnoses were made by a combination of histology, serology, PCR, and empirical response to therapy. Toxoplasma serologies (IgG IFA) were compared in the patients with central nervous system (CNS) toxoplasmosis and those without CNS toxoplasmosis.Fifty-six patients were evaluable and a definitive diagnosis was made in 38 patients: toxoplasmosis (17), lymphoma (14), PML (three), Aspergillus (one), tuberculoma (one), Cryptococcus (one), varicella-zoster virus (one). Patients with lymphoma had significantly higher lesion/contralateral scalp ratios compared to patients without lymphoma: 1.03 vs. 0.67, P < 0.05. Using a cut-off of 0.90 for the lesion/scalp uptake ratios (based on analysis of ROC curves) the sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of lymphoma were 86% and 83%, respectively. Serum Toxoplasma IgG titres were significantly higher in patients diagnosed with toxoplasmosis compared to those with a diagnosis other than toxoplasmosis, 1:5444 vs. 1:15, P < 0.05. Only one patient with confirmed toxoplasmosis had a Toxoplasma serology < 1:256, while no patients without toxoplasmosis (including all lymphoma patients) had serologies > 1:256.In a series of HIV-infected patients, Tl-201 SPECT was able to accurately differentiate primary brain lymphoma from other causes of focal CNS lesions in most patients however, both false positive and false negative results occurred. By combining Tl-201 SPECT with serum Toxoplasma IgG, diagnostic accuracy was improved.",2000,10908023,no
Aspergillus antigen testing in bone marrow transplant recipients.,"To assess the clinical usefulness of a commercial aspergillus antigen enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in bone marrow transplant recipients, and to compare it with a commercial latex agglutination (LA) test.In total, 2026 serum samples from 104 bone marrow transplant recipients were tested. These comprised 67 sera from seven patients who had died with confirmed IA, 268 sera from nine patients who had died with suspected IA, and 1691 sera from 88 patients with no clinical, radiological, or microbiological signs of IA.The ELISA was more sensitive than the LA test. All patients who were ELISA positive were also LA positive, and a positive LA result never preceded a positive ELISA. Twelve of 16 patients with confirmed or suspected IA were ELISA positive on two or more occasions, compared with 10 of 15 who were LA positive. ELISA was positive before LA in five patients (range, 2-14 days), and became positive on the same day in the remainder. Aspergillus antigen was detected by ELISA a median of 15 days before death (range, 4-233). Clinical and/or radiological evidence of IA was noted in all patients, and a positive ELISA was never the sole criterion for introduction of antifungal treatment. Two samples (one from each of two patients without IA) gave false positive results.The aspergillus ELISA is a specific indicator of invasive aspergillosis if the criterion of two positive samples is required to confirm the diagnosis. However, the test is insufficiently sensitive to diagnose aspergillosis before other symptoms or signs are apparent, and hence is unlikely to lead to earlier initiation of antifungal treatment. It is therefore unsuitable for screening of asymptomatic patients at risk of invasive aspergillosis, but does have a useful role in confirming the diagnosis in symptomatic patients.",2000,10889818,yes
Cell-specific and conditional expression of caffeoyl-coenzyme A-3-O-methyltransferase in poplar.,"Caffeoyl coenzyme A-3-O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT) plays an important role in lignin biosynthesis and is encoded by two genes in poplar (Populus trichocarpa). Here, we describe the expression pattern conferred by the two CCoAOMT promoters when fused to the gus-coding sequence in transgenic poplar (Populus tremula x Populus alba). Both genes were expressed similarly in xylem and differentially in phloem. In xylem, expression was preferentially observed in vessels and contact rays, whereas expression was barely detectable in storage rays and fibers, suggesting different routes to monolignol biosynthesis in the different xylem types. Furthermore, after wounding, fungal infection, and bending, the expression of both genes was induced concomitantly with de novo lignin deposition. Importantly, upon bending and leaning of the stem, the cell-specific expression pattern was lost, and both genes were expressed in all cell types of the xylem. CCoAOMT promoter activity correlated well with the presence of the CCoAOMT protein, as shown by immunolocalization. These expression data may explain, at least in part, the heterogeneity in lignin composition that is observed between cell types and upon different environmental conditions.",2000,10889235,no
Studies on the production of fungal peroxidases in Aspergillus niger.,"To get insight into the limiting factors existing for the efficient production of fungal peroxidase in filamentous fungi, the expression of the Phanerochaete chrysosporium lignin peroxidase H8 (lipA) and manganese peroxidase (MnP) H4 (mnp1) genes in Aspergillus niger has been studied. For this purpose, a protease-deficient A. niger strain and different expression cassettes have been used. Northern blotting experiments indicated high steady-state mRNA levels for the recombinant genes. Manganese peroxidase was secreted into the culture medium as an active protein. The recombinant protein showed specific activity and a spectrum profile similar to those of the native enzyme, was correctly processed at its N terminus, and had a slightly lower mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Recombinant MnP production could be increased up to 100 mg/liter upon hemoglobin supplementation of the culture medium. Lignin peroxidase was also secreted into the extracellular medium, although the protein was not active, presumably due to incorrect processing of the secreted enzyme. Expression of the lipA and mnp1 genes fused to the A. niger glucoamylase gene did not result in improved production yields.",2000,10877800,no
Molecular organization of the alkali-insoluble fraction of Aspergillus fumigatus cell wall.,"Physical and biological properties of the fungal cell wall are determined by the composition and arrangement of the structural polysaccharides. Cell wall polymers of fungi are classically divided into two groups depending on their solubility in hot alkali. We have analyzed the alkali-insoluble fraction of the Aspergillus fumigatus cell wall, which is the fraction believed to be responsible for fungal cell wall rigidity. Using enzymatic digestions with recombinant endo-beta-1,3-glucanase and chitinase, fractionation by gel filtration, affinity chromatography with immobilized lectins, and high performance liquid chromatography, several fractions that contained specific interpolysaccharide covalent linkages were isolated. Unique features of the A. fumigatus cell wall are (i) the absence of beta-1,6-glucan and (ii) the presence of a linear beta-1, 3/1,4-glucan, never previously described in fungi. Galactomannan, chitin, and beta-1,3-glucan were also found in the alkali-insoluble fraction. The beta-1,3-glucan is a branched polymer with 4% of beta-1,6 branch points. Chitin, galactomannan, and the linear beta-1, 3/1,4-glucan were covalently linked to the nonreducing end of beta-1, 3-glucan side chains. As in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, chitin was linked via a beta-1,4 linkage to beta-1,3-glucan. The data obtained suggested that the branching of beta-1,3-glucan is an early event in the construction of the cell wall, resulting in an increase of potential acceptor sites for chitin, galactomannan, and the linear beta-1,3/1,4-glucan.",2000,10869365,no
Disseminated Penicillium marneffei infection in an HIV-positive female from Thailand in Germany.,"We report the case of a 33 year old Thai female, who was married in Germany for eight years and used to travel to Thailand every year for several weeks. She presented with abdominal and back pain, prolonged fever, generalized lymphadenopathy, and a recent history of oral thrush. She was diagnosed HIV positive with initial CD4 counts of 18/microliter and an HI virus load of 59,000 copies/ml. Antiviral therapy was installed with zidovudin, lamivudin, and efavirenz. Abdominal CT scans revealed greatly enlarged abdominal lymph nodes. Fine needle aspirates of cervical and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, sputum samples, blood samples, and a bone marrow biopsy were microscopically positive for Penicillium marneffei and grew P. marneffei. The isolates were sensitive to amphotericin B, flucytosine, itraconazole, and fluconazole. Both universal and specific fungal polymerase chain reaction assays were positive in various samples. Serum Aspergillus galactomannan antigen, which is known to crossreact with P. marneffei, was elevated and subsequently used for monitoring of therapy. With antifungal treatment (intravenous amphotericin B 0.6 mg/kg/d for two weeks, oral itraconazole 400 mg/d for 10 weeks and 200 mg/d as maintenance therapy), the fever declined in 6 days, the size of the enlarged lymph nodes gradually decreased in the CT scans, and the initial abdominal and back pain vanished.",2000,10865899,no
Characterization of two novel defense peptides from pea (Pisum sativum) seeds.,"A fraction that possesses antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger has been isolated from seeds of the pea (Pisum sativum) by ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-75. On further purification by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, two small cysteine-rich polypeptides were obtained (Psd1 and Psd2). They are localized primarily in vascular bundles and epidermis tissues of pea pods and exhibit high antifungal activity toward several fungi, displaying IC(50) values ranging from 0.04 to 22 microg/ml. This inhibitory activity decreases when A. niger growth medium is supplemented with cations such as Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Na(+), and K(+). Although the primary sequence of both Psd1 and Psd2 shows homology with other plant defensins, they cannot easily be assigned to any established group.",2000,10860545,no
[Establishment and evaluation of microdilution assays for the in vitro sensitivity testing of Aspergillus fumigatus].,"For the in vitro sensitivity assessment of moulds different methods of micro- and macro-dilution assays as well as agar diffusion assays in different media formulations have been described so far. Until now, no standardized method has been preferred. The aim of the present study is to establish and to evaluate a microdilution assay for the in vitro chemosensitivity testing of Aspergillus fumigatus. This method should show a late onset of superficial growth and sporulation as well as a relative independency of the test inoculum. As reference substances, amphotericin B (CAS 1397-89-3) and 5-fluorocytosine (CAS 2022-85-7), which are both used for therapy of systemic mycoses, have been tested. Both substances show an excellent water solubility in liquid media. Fifty clinical isolates of A. fumigatus were used for the testings. The strains showed a better growth in Isosensitest (ISO)-medium than in Yeast-Nitrogen-Glucose (YNG)-medium. Growth was submers++ during the observation time, adherent to the bottom of the microtiter plate. Superficial growth with sporulation only occurred in a late stage of growth. Only a weak inoculum effect could be observed and the MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) values determined macroscopically as well as using an ELISA reader showed to be almost comparable with a clearly defined breakpoint for the MIC discrimination. For amphotericin B, lower MIC values were observed in ISO-medium (0.25-2 micrograms/ml median M = 1 microgram/ml) than in YNG-medium (0.25 microgram/ml",2000,10858878,no
Selected recombinant Aspergillus fumigatus allergens bind specifically to IgE in ABPA.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a hypersensitivity lung disease resulting from exposure to Aspergillus fumigatus allergens. Patients with ABPA show elevated Aspergillus-specific serum IgE, a major criterion used in the diagnosis of the disease. Crude culture filtrate and mycelial antigens have been used widely to demonstrate IgE antibody to Aspergillus in the sera of patients. While these antigens have been useful in the diagnosis of ABPA, occasionally they present inconsistency in their reactivity and lack of specificity. Although in recent years, a number of purified A. fumigatus allergens have been produced by molecular cloning, no attempt was made to evaluate them systematically.To evaluate the recombinant proteins from A. fumigatus for their IgE antibody binding, we studied sera from ABPA patients and controls by antigen specific enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Recombinant Aspergillus allergens Asp f 1, f 2, f 3, f 4, and f 6 were studied for their specific binding to IgE in the sera of ABPA patients, A. fumigatus skin prick test positive asthmatics, and normal controls from the USA and Switzerland. The sera were blinded and studied by ELISA in two different laboratories.All the recombinant allergens showed IgE antibody binding with sera from patients with ABPA, whereas only fewer asthmatics and normal sera showed significant binding. The three selected recombinant allergens together reacted with all the ABPA patients studied.The results demonstrate that Asp f 2, f 4, and f 6 can be used in the serodiagnosis of ABPA, while IgE antibody binding to Asp f 1 and f 3 was not specific.",2000,10848921,no
"High-level production of recombinant fungal endo-beta-1,4-xylanase in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris.","Efficient production of recombinant Aspergillus niger family 11 1, 4-beta-xylanase was achieved in Pichia pastoris. The cDNA-encoding XylA fused to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae invertase signal peptide was placed under the control of the P. pastoris AOX1 promoter. Secretion yields up to 60 mg/liter were obtained in synthetic medium. The recombinant XylA was purified to homogeneity using a one-step purification protocol and found to be identical to the enzyme overexpressed in A. niger with respect to size, pI, and immunoreactivity. N-terminal sequence analysis of the recombinant protein indicated that the S. cerevisiae signal peptide was correctly processed in P. pastoris. The purified protein has a molecular weight of 19,893 Da, in excellent agreement with the calculated mass, and appears as one single band on isoelectric focusing with pI value around 3.5. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of one major isoform produced by P. pastoris and the absence of glycosylation. The recombinant enzyme was further characterized in terms of specific activity, pH profile, kinetic parameters, and thermostability toward birchwood xylan as substrate and compared with the xylanase purified from A. niger. Both enzymes exhibit a pH optimum at 3.5 and maximal activity at 50 degrees C. The enzyme activity follows normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics with K(m) and V(max) values similar for both enzymes. P. pastoris produced recombinant xylanase in high yields that can be obtained readily as a single form. A. niger xylanase is the first microbial xylanase efficiently secreted and correctly processed by P. pastoris.",2000,10833405,no
IgE-mediated sensitization to mould allergens among patients with allergic respiratory diseases in a desert environment.,"The importance of fungal allergens in the development of allergic diseases in a desert environment is uncertain. This study evaluated the prevalence of IgE sensitization to moulds among patients with allergic respiratory diseases in Kuwait - a desert country.A total of 810 patients (male:female ratio 1.4) with a mean age of 32.3 years (range 2-76 years) with extrinsic asthma or allergic rhinitis were studied. Sera from the patients were tested by the CAP-RAST method for specific IgE to 6 fungi (Penicillium, Cladosporium, Aspergillus, Candida, Alternaria and Helminthosporium). For comparison house dust mite and Bermuda grass were also assessed.The overall positivity to at least one mould was 20.9%. Among 120 matched control subjects, the value was 5. 8%. The value was much higher among patients with asthma alone (45. 8%) or both asthma and rhinitis (28.3%) than those with rhinitis alone (11.8% p < 0.001). Asthmatic children had the highest sensitization rate (66.0% in the 7- to 12-year age group), which declined sharply with age. Among asthmatics, Candida and Aspergillus had the highest sensitization rates (23.1 and 21.3%, respectively), followed by Helminthosporium (18.8%), Cladosporium (15.9%), Alternaria (14.6%) and Penicillium (13.9%). The values for mite and Bermuda grass were 41.2 and 54.6%, respectively. Among asthmatic children, severe asthma was significantly more frequent among mould-positive (51.6%) than mould-negative patients (17.5%Even in this desert environment, sensitization to moulds is quite common among patients with allergic respiratory diseases, with a striking preponderance among children with asthma. Mould allergy could also be an important factor determining asthma severity in this environment.",2000,10828720,no
"A spindle pole body-associated protein, SNAD, affects septation and conidiation in Aspergillus nidulans.","The nudA1 mutation in the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain gene inhibits nuclear migration, colony growth and asexual sporulation (conidiation) in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. It also alters the location of the first cell division event (septation) and prevents nucleation of tip cells. We showed previously that a suppressor of nudA1, snaD290, partially reversed the nuclear migration defect and partially restored colony growth. We have now demonstrated that the snaD290 mutation also delays septation and restores the septum to its normal position, allowing tip cells to be nucleated. Although snaD290 does not affect nuclear migration or vegetative hyphal growth, it almost completely inhibits conidiation. We propose that the SNAD protein participates in septation, and is essential for asexual spore formation. SnaD encodes a novel 76-kDa coiled-coil protein (SNAD) that is located at the spindle pole body throughout the cell cycle. Therefore, our results suggest that proteins at the spindle pole body are likely to be involved in temporal regulation of septation in A. nidulans.",2000,10821171,no
"Interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha and their soluble receptors in the blood serum of patients with denture stomatitis and fungal infection.","Determinations of the blood serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and their soluble receptors (sIL-6R, sTNFR) in denture stomatitis patients (DS) were performed. Serum levels of interleukins and their soluble receptors were measured using the ELISA method. In all examined patients mycological diagnostics were conducted using API 20C AUX stripe tests and an automatic ATB machine. Results were compared with those of healthy denture wearers (D), and controls (C). In DS patients, yeasts were isolated in 90.9%, in D in 66.7% of cases. The most often isolated species in both groups was Candida albicans. Mean concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-alpha were statistically significantly higher in DS and D groups compared to controls. Mean concentrations of sIL-6R were similar in all groups however, concentrations of sTNFR in both DS and D groups were significantly lower compared to controls. There were no correlations found between values of IL-6 and TNF-alpha nor between examined interleukins and their soluble receptors.",2000,10807050,no
"Enhancement of IL-8 production from human monocytic and granulocytic cell lines, THP-1 and HL-60, stimulated with Malassezia furfur.","Previously, we reported that Malassezia furfur, causing systemic fungal infection, was taken up into human monocytic cell line, THP-1, in a concentration-dependent manner. This fact suggested that M. furfur could activate phagocytes, such as monocyte and polymorphonuclear leukocyte. Thus we examined cytokine mRNA expression from human monocytic and granulocytic cell line, THP-1 and HL-60, stimulated with M. furfur by using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and ELISA. We chose IL-1alpha, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 and TNF-alpha as primers for THP-1, and IL-1alpha, IL-6 and IL-8 for HL-60. M. furfur induced the expression of IL-8 mRNA from THP-1 and HL-60 following incubation for 3 h, and also induced IL-1alpha mRNA from HL-60, although this induction was weaker than that of IL-8 mRNA. Furthermore, opsonized M. furfur induced stronger expression of IL-8 mRNA in comparison with intact M. furfur. IL-8 production from THP-1 and HL-60 was enhanced in a concentration- and incubation time-dependent manner. These facts strongly suggested that M. furfur could activate phagocytes, and could induce inflammatory responses in systemic infection.",2000,10799807,no
Comparison of commercial latex agglutination and sandwich enzyme immunoassays with a competitive binding inhibition enzyme immunoassay for detection of antigenemia and antigenuria in a rabbit model of invasive aspergillosis.,"A commercial latex agglutination assay (LA) and a sandwich enzyme immunoassay (SEIA) (Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur, Marnes-la-Coquette, France) were compared with a competitive binding inhibition assay (enzyme immunoassay [EIA]) to determine the potential uses and limitations of these antigen detection tests for the sensitive, specific, and rapid diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA). Toward this end, well-characterized serum and urine specimens were obtained by using a rabbit model of IA. Serially collected serum or urine specimens were obtained daily from control rabbits or from rabbits immunosuppressed and infected systemically with Aspergillus fumigatus. By 4 days after infection, EIA, LA, and SEIA detected antigen in the sera of 93, 93, and 100% of A. fumigatus-infected rabbits, respectively, whereas antigen was detected in the urine of 93, 100, and 100% of the rabbits, respectively. False-positive results for non-A. fumigatus-infected rabbits for EIA, LA, and SEIA were as follows: for serum, 14, 11, and 23%, respectively for urine, 14, 84, and 90%, respectively. Therefore, although the sensitivities of all three tests were similar, the specificity was generally greater for EIA than for LA or SEIA. Infection was also detected earlier by EIA, by which the serum of 53% of A. fumigatus-infected rabbits was positive as early as 1 day after infection, whereas the serum of only 27% of the rabbits tested by LA was positive. Although the serum of 92% of A. fumigatus-infected rabbits was positive by SEIA as early as 1 day after infection, the serum of a high percentage (50%) was false positive before infection. The urine of 21% of A. fumigatus-infected rabbits was positive by EIA as early as 1 day after infection, and the urine of none of the rabbits was false positive before infection. When EIA results for urine specimens were combined with those for serum, sensitivity was improved (i.e., 67% of rabbits were positive by 1 day after infection and only one rabbit gave a false-positive result). A total of 93% of A. fumigatus-infected rabbits were positive for antigen in urine as early as 1 day after infection and the urine of 100% of the rabbits was positive by SEIA. However, before infection, 79% of A. fumigatus-infected rabbits were false positive for antigen in urine by LA and 90% were false positive for antigen in urine by SEIA. These data indicate that the EIA has the potential to be used to diagnose IA with both serum and urine specimens and to detect a greater number of infections earlier with greater specificity than the specificities achieved with the commercial tests.",2000,10799464,no
"The Lupinus albus class-III chitinase gene, IF3, is constitutively expressed in vegetative organs and developing seeds.","A cDNA fragment encoding a Lupinus albus. L. class-III chitinase, IF3, was isolated, using a cDNA probe from Cucumis sativus L., by in-situ plaque hybridization from a cDNA library constructed in the Uni-ZAP XR vector, with mRNAs isolated from mature lupin leaves. The cDNA had a coding sequence of 293 amino acids including a 27-residue N-terminal signal peptide. A class-III chitinase gene was detected by Southern analysis in the L. albus genome. Western blotting experiments showed that the IF3 protein was constitutively present during seed development and in all the studied vegetative lupin organs (i.e., roots, hypocotyls and leaves) at two growth stages (7- and 20-d-old plants). Accumulation of both the IF3 mRNA and IF3 protein was triggered by salicylic acid treatment as well as by abiotic (UV-C light and wounding) and biotic stress conditions (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides infection). In necrotic leaves, IF3 chitinase mRNA was present at a higher level than that of another mRNA encoding a pathogenesis-related (PR) protein from L. albus (a PR-10) and that of the rRNAs. We suggest that one role of the IF3 chitinase could be in the defense of the plant against fungal infection, though our results do not exclude other functions for this protein.",2000,10787047,no
Aspergillosis in bone marrow transplant recipients.,"Invasive aspergillosis in bone marrow transplant recipient is associated with a high mortality. Diagnosis is often delayed because the inflammatory response is blunted by immunosuppression. The gold standard of tissue biopsy is often considered too in invasive as the procedure is often complicated by bleeding and secondary infection. Recent finding on non-invasive tests such as serial measurement of peripheral blood galactomannan antigen or DNA appears to be promising. However, the limited availability of such tests and requirement for expertise are still hampering their use in routine clinical management. More often than not, initiation of antifungal therapy is empirical and based on suggestive radiological changes. Amphotericin B remains the gold standard of therapy but liposconal preparation may prove to be less nephrotoxic and equally effective. Treatment outcome depends more on the acceleration of the recovery of the immune system and the reduction of anti-GVHD therapy than the antifungal agent followed by surgical resection. The efficacy of many reported anti-aspergillosis prophylactic regimen has not been proved in randomized control trials. Despite the absence of data, such policy should still be considered in transplant units with high incidence of aspergillus or undergoing renovation.",2000,10781748,no
Identification of the catalytic residues of the first family of beta(1-3)glucanosyltransferases identified in fungi.,"A new family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored beta(1-3)glucanosyltransferases (Gelp), recently identified and characterized in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, showed functional similarity to the Gas/Phr/Epd protein families, which are involved in yeast morphogenesis. Sequence comparisons and hydrophobic cluster analysis (HCA) showed that all the Gas/Phr/Epd/Gel proteins belong to a new family of glycosylhydrolases, family 72. We confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical analysis that the two conserved glutamate residues (the putative catalytic residues of this family, as determined by HCA) are involved in the active site of this family of glycosylhydrolases.",2000,10769178,no
Evidence that the glucoamylases and alpha-amylase secreted by Aspergillus niger are proteolytically processed products of a precursor enzyme.,"A 125-kDa starch hydrolysing enzyme of Aspergillus niger characterised by its ability to dextrinise and saccharify starch [Suresh et al. (1999) Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 51, 673-675] was also found to possess activity towards raw starch. Segregation of these activities in the 71-kDa glucoamylase and a 53-kDa alpha-amylase-like enzyme supported by antibody cross-reactivity studies and the isolation of mutants based on assay screens for the secretion of particular enzyme forms revealed the 125-kDa starch hydrolysing enzyme as their precursor. N-terminal sequence analysis further revealed that the 71-kDa glucoamylase was the N-terminal product of the precursor enzyme. Immunological cross reactivity of the 53-kDa amylase with antibodies raised against the precursor enzyme but not with the 71- and 61-kDa glucoamylase antibodies suggested that this enzyme activity is represented by the C-terminal fragment of the precursor. The N-terminal sequence of the 53-kDa protein showed similarity to the reported Taka amylase of Aspergillus oryzae. Antibody cross-reactivity to a 10-kDa non-enzymic peptide and a 61-kDa glucoamylase described these proteins as products of the 71-kDa glucoamylase. Identification of only the precursor starch hydrolysing enzyme in the protein extracts of fungal protoplasts suggested proteolytic processing in the cellular periplasmic space as the cause for the secretion of multiple forms of amylases by A. niger.",2000,10767433,no
Systemic infections with Candida sp. and Aspergillus sp. in immunocompromised patients with hematological malignancies: current serological and molecular diagnostic methods.,"Within recent years, novel serological and molecular methods have been developed to improve the early diagnosis of invasive fungal infections especially in patients with malignant hematological diseases being at highest risk of developing these life-threatening infections. Early diagnosis is essential for adequate therapeutic management, which, however, often remains difficult since the diagnostic tools clinically used either lack specificity or sensitivity, or both at worst.

Autoantibodies directed against bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein in patients with cystic fibrosis: association with microbial respiratory tract colonization.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is associated with the appearance of serum autoantibodies directed against bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI).To determine the age-specific seroprevalence rates of anti-BPI-IgG and IgA in a population of patients with CF and to correlate anti-BPI antibody concentrations with microbial respiratory tract colonization and pulmonary function variables at the time of serum sampling and 6 years thereafter.Determination of BPI antibodies of the IgG and IgA isotypes using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in sera of a CF serum bank of 1992 correlation of anti-BPI antibody concentrations with age, clinical score, pulmonary function variables in 1992 and 1998, total serum immunoglobulin isotype concentrations and respiratory tract colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aspergillus spp.Seventy-one patients (age in 1992, 14.1 +/- 7.5 years) were studied. Reactivities for anti-BPI-IgG and IgA were found in 28 (39%) and 26 (37%) patients, respectively. The seroprevalence of anti-BPI-IgA, but not IgG, increased significantly with age. P. aeruginosa colonization was associated with elevated concentrations of anti-BPI-IgG (P = 0.003) and IgA (P = 0.037). There were significant negative correlations between pulmonary function variables (vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 s) in 1992 and 1998, respectively, and concentrations of anti-BPI-IgG or IgA in a multiple regression analysis. Anti-BPI-IgG, but not IgA, remained significantly associated with P. aeruginosa colonization (P = 0.006) and with reduced vital capacity (P = 0.01) in 1998 after correction for total serum isotype concentration.Anti-BPI-IgG are strongly associated with concurrent P. aeruginosa colonization and with long term restrictive pulmonary function abnormalities.",2000,10749460,no
Feline asthma syndrome in African lions (Panthera leo).,"Feline asthma syndrome, previously recognized only in domestic cats, was diagnosed in three captive African lions (Panthera leo), one of which died as a result of the condition. Two of the lions displayed progressive signs for 7 yr, including severe bouts of coughing, wheezing, dyspnea, rhonchi, and tachypnea that were most severe during the spring and summer, and the third lion displayed acute signs only once. Scattered to diffuse increased interstitial markings, peribronchial cuffing, and focal atelectasis were visible in radiographs. At necropsy, multiple subpleural bullae, 2-3 cm in diameter, were scattered throughout the lung tissue. There were thick-walled bronchi and bronchioles filled with thick grayish mucus, and alveolar spaces were enlarged with severe, diffuse, banded multifocal areas of alveolar wall fibrosis. The lions had significantly elevated IgE type I immediate hypersensitivity responses to recognized aeroallergens. The captive management of lions should address the design and maintenance of allergen-free air supplies. Ventilation systems should be examined routinely and thoroughly cleaned of any residue. The frequency of examination should increase during the summer. Lions and other large cats should be routinely screened for IgE aeroallergen-specific titers, asthma cases should be treated promptly with prednisolone, and investigations of etiology should be initiated.",2000,10749445,no
Quantitative galactomannan detection is superior to PCR in diagnosing and monitoring invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in an experimental rat model.,"Two diagnostic tests, an Aspergillus-specific PCR and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the quantitative determination of galactomannan, were compared for diagnosing and monitoring invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Persistently neutropenic rats with left-sided invasive pulmonary aspergillosis were sacrificed at regular intervals after inoculation. Blood samples and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were cultured and tested by PCR as well as by ELISA. Disseminated fungal infection in extrapulmonary organs was determined. The sensitivity of the ELISA was higher than that of the PCR on all days of measurements, in both blood and BAL fluid. Positive PCR or ELISA results in blood were not significantly associated with disseminated fungal infection. Serial testing in a separate group of rats showed consistently increasing concentrations of circulating galactomannan during the course of disease, while a positive PCR could be followed by negative results. The concentration of galactomannan was highly predictive for the time of survival (P < 0.0001). It was concluded that, in this model, quantitative galactomannan detection is superior to PCR in diagnosing and monitoring invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.",2000,10747121,no
Aspergillus fumigatus isolated from blood samples of a patient with pulmonary aspergilloma after embolization.,"Aspergillus DNA was detected by PCR in the serum sample of a 78-year-old man and galactomannan antigen of Aspergillus by sandwich ELISA was found. However, the infiltrative hyphae were not detected by the histopathologic examination of the lung. He developed hemoptysis, which required embolization of bronchial arteries. Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated from blood samples after embolization by the lysis centrifugation method. To our knowledge, this is probably the first case in which Aspergillus spp. has been isolated from the systemic circulatory blood in a patient with pulmonary aspergilloma after embolization.",2000,10732844,no
Identification and expression of an allergen Asp f 13 from Aspergillus fumigatus and epitope mapping using human IgE antibodies and rabbit polyclonal antibodies.,"The Aspergillus genus of fungi is known to be one of the most prevalent aeroallergens. On two-dimensional immunoblotting using patients' sera containing IgE specific for Asp f 13, an allergen with a molecular mass of 33 kDa and a pI of 6.2 was identified. This allergen was also present in A. fumigatus culture filtrates. Furthermore, the sequence of the Asp f 13 cDNA was identical to that for alkaline protease isolated from A. fumigatus and showed 42-49% identity of amino acids with two proteases from P. cyclopium and T. album and with the Pen c 1 allergen from P. citrinum. Asp f 13 coding sequences were expressed in Escherichia coli as a [His](6)-tagged fusion protein which was purified by Ni(2+)-chelate affinity chromatography. Recombinant Asp f 13 was recognized by rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Asp f 13 and by IgE antibodies from subject allergic to A. fumigatus. To identify and characterize the linear epitopes of this allergen, a combination of chemical and enzymatic cleavage and immunoblotting techniques, with subsequent N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry, were performed. At least 13 different linear epitopes reacting with the rabbit anti-Asp f 13 antiserum were identified, located throughout the entire molecule. In contrast, IgE from A. fumigatus-sensitive patients bound to three immunodominant epitopes at the C-terminal of the protein.",2000,10677362,no
Trichophyton-specific IgE in patients with dermatophytosis is not associated with aeroallergen sensitivity.,"It has been proposed that Trichophyton infection is associated with atopy and allergy.Our purpose was (1) to confirm whether atopy predisposes to chronic dermatophytosis and (2) to investigate whether Trichophyton infection induces atopic disease.Patients attending dermatology clinics and suspected of having dermatomycosis underwent in a prospective manner fungal culture and Trichophyton and inhalant skin tests, and blood serum was collected for total IgE and Trichophyton radioallergosorbent testing. Personal and family history of atopic diseases was also investigated.According to mycologic culture, atopic history, and inhalant skin test results, patients were classified into 4 groups: (1) atopy plus mycosis (n = 28), (2) atopy (n = 26), (3) mycosis (n = 35), and (4) no atopy, no mycosis (n = 33). Patients with active mycosis (groups 1 and 3) demonstrated significantly increased positivity of Trichophyton skin tests compared with patients without fungal infection (groups 2 and 4), regardless of their atopic status, whereas atopic patients (those in groups 1 and 2) had significantly increased levels of total serum IgE compared with nonatopic subjects. Trichophytosis was not more prevalent in atopic than in nonatopic subjects, and atopic diseases were not more frequent in culture-positive than in culture-negative patients.Our results indicate that Trichophyton -specific IgE is observed in patients with trichophytosis regardless of atopy.",2000,10719306,no
Is fungal alpha-amylase in bread an allergen?,"The enzyme alpha-amylase from Aspergillus oryzae used in bakeries to improve the bread quality has been identified as an inhalative allergen in baker's asthma. It is doubtful whether this enzyme can induce allergic sensitization in regular bread consumers.To find out whether fungal alpha-amylase in bread and rolls retains its antibody-binding capacity and allergenicity after the baking procedure.Rabbit antibodies directed to fungal alpha-amylase were used for the development of a two-site enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This assay was used to analyse different fractions of bread and rolls baked with the usual amounts of alpha-amylase in comparison with control products without added enzyme. Competitive experiments between bakers' sera containing specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E to alpha-amylase and the rabbit antibodies were performed. Additionally, specific IgE binding to fungal alpha-amylase was inhibited by native or heated alpha-amylase.With the highly specific two-site ELISA for native alpha-amylase in the crust of bread bottom and sides, 2.3-7 ng antigenic alpha-amylase per gram crust were measured. No alpha-amylase could be detected in the crumb fractions. Rabbit antibodies to native alpha-amylase completely inhibited human IgE binding to alpha-amylase allergen disks.The results prove residual antibody-binding capacity of alpha-amylase in bread crusts and in the crust of some rolls. In comparison with the content of alpha-amylase in dough, between 0.1 and 20% of the antibody-binding capacity remained.",2000,10718854,no
Allergen-specific IgE levels against crude mould and storage mite extracts and recombinant mould allergens in sera from horses affected with chronic bronchitis.,"Immunoglobulin E antibody (IgE) levels against four recombinant (r) mould allergens (r-Aspergillus fumigatus [rAsp f] 7, 8 and 9 r-Alternaria alternata 1 [rAlta1]) and crude mould (Aspergillus fumigatus, Alternaria alternata, Penicillium notatum) and storage mite extracts were determined by ELISA in sera from 24 pulmonary sound control horses and 26 horses suffering from chronic bronchitis/bronchiolitis (CB), also called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Serum IgG and IgA titres were also determined against Aspergillus fumigatus extract and rAsp f 8.IgE against the crude extracts could be measured in all sera, but there was no significant difference between CB-affected and control horses. In contrast, only 8-30% of the horses, depending on the r-allergen tested, had detectable IgE levels in serum against the r-allergens. Horses with CB had significantly more often detectable IgE levels than controls against rAlt a 1 (10/26 and 3/24, respectively, p=0. 054), rAsp f 7 (13/26 and 2/24, respectively, p<0.01) and rAsp f 8 (11/26 and 1/24, respectively, p<0.01). Only four horses (three CB-affected and one healthy, p0.05) had detectable IgE levels against rAsp f 9. Furthermore, CB-affected horses were often sensitised against two or more r-allergens (13/26 of the CB-affected horses) while only one of the 24 healthy horses had positive IgE levels against more than one r-allergens. Similarly to IgE levels, no significant differences between CB-affected and healthy horses were found for IgG titres against the Aspergillus fumigatus extract. However, horses with CB had significantly higher serum IgG titres against rAsp f 8 than healthy controls (median=28 versus 10 relative ELISA units [REU], p<0.01). Additionally, horses with detectable IgE titres against rAsp f 8 had significantly higher IgG titres against this r-allergen than horses with undetectable IgE titres (median IgG titres=46 and 13 REU, respectively",2000,10713338,no
Glucoamylase::green fluorescent protein fusions to monitor protein secretion in Aspergillus niger.,"A glucoamylase::green fluorescent protein fusion (GLA::sGFP) was constructed which allows the green fluorescent protein to be used as an in vivo reporter of protein secretion in Aspergillus niger. Two secretory fusions were designed for secretion of GLA::sGFP which employed slightly different lengths of the glucoamylase protein (GLA499 and GLA514). Expression of GLA::sGFP revealed that fluorescence was localized in the hyphal cell walls and septa, and that fluorescence was most intense at hyphal apices. Extracellular GLA::sGFP was detectable by Western blotting only in the supernatant of young cultures grown in soya milk medium. In older cultures, acidification of the medium and induction of proteases were probably responsible for the loss of extracellular and cell wall fluorescence and the inability to detect GLA::sGFP by Western analysis. A strain containing the GLA::sGFP construct was subjected to UV mutagenesis and survivors screened for mutations in the general secretory pathway. Three mutants were isolated that were unable to form a halo on either starch or gelatin medium. All three mutants grew poorly compared to the parental strain. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that for two of the mutants, GLA::sGFP accumulated intracellularly with no evidence of wall fluorescence, whereas for the third mutant, wall fluorescence was observed with no evidence of intracellular accumulation. These results indicate that the GLA::sGFP fusion constructs can be used as convenient fluorescent markers to study the dynamics of protein secretion in vivo and as a tool in the isolation of mutants in the general secretory pathway.",2000,10708380,no
Immunochemical detection of molds: a review.,"Molds are widely distributed in nature and cause deterioration of foods and feeds. Their mycotoxins can adversely affect human and animal health. Suitable assays for molds, therefore, are required to implement control and regulatory strategies and to develop appropriate feeding regimens for mold-infested feeds. Many different types of mold assays have been used, most of which are not reproducible or accurate. However, the immunoassays, particularly enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), can be especially useful. Among these, assays that detect the water-soluble extracellular secretions of fungi, the exoantigens, are generally able to detect fungi at the genus or species level, whereas the heat-stable polysaccharides tend to be specific for one or more genus of fungi. Several species and genus (genera)-specific ELISAs have been developed using monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies against exoantigens and heat-stable polysaccharides from a wide range of fungi, including Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Fusarium species. Other assays have been developed that nonspecifically detect mold in food or feed, some using antibodies against a mixture of antigens from different fungi. These assays are highly sensitive, are easy to perform, and provide an index of the amount of mold present in the sample. Further refinement of these assays should facilitate their widespread use by food and feed processors, regulatory agencies, taxonomists, and research scientists.",2000,10678438,no
Histologic examination of bone marrow core biopsy specimens has limited value in the diagnosis of mycobacterial and fungal infections in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.,"Bone marrow cultures and biopsy specimens are commonly obtained to rule out disseminated infections, especially in persons with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and cytopenias. Using culture as the gold standard, we reviewed 130 consecutive bone marrow cores obtained from 114 AIDS patients along with results of concurrent blood and/or bone marrow aspirate cultures to determine the usefulness of histologic examination for diagnosis of mycobacterial and fungal infections. We also compared the ability of Ziehl-Neelsen, auramine-rhodamine (AR), polyclonal antibody to Mycobacterium bovis (Ab), and Gomori's methenamine silver staining to detect infections. Twenty-seven patients had mycobacterial infection (25 Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex cases and two Mycobacterium tuberculosis cases) detected by blood and/or bone marrow cultures. The maximum sensitivity of histology was 50% when the auramine-rhodamine stain and the polyclonal antibody to M bovis were used in combination. The single best stain was auramine-rhodamine, with a sensitivity of 44%, followed by the polyclonal antibody to M bovis (35%). Granulomas were observed in nine cases of mycobacterial infection and did not correlate with the presence of stainable organisms. Of seven patients with positive fungal cultures of bone marrow, four had granulomas and a positive Gomori's methenamine silver stain, one had only a positive stain, and two had neither granulomas nor a diagnostic stain. Overall, granulomas were not sensitive for the detection of infections when culture-proven mycobacterial and fungal cases were evaluated together. We conclude that bone marrow examination has a limited value in the routine evaluation of common opportunistic infections in AIDS patients and recommend that less-invasive tests, such as blood cultures, be obtained initially in most circumstances.",2000,10684373,no
Comparison of outdoor allergenic particles and allergen levels.,"Spore and pollen counts have been used traditionally to determine aeroallergen exposure. Using a liquid based collector and enzyme immunoassays, we have developed methods for measuring airborne allergen concentrations. In this work we test the hypothesis that airborne allergen concentrations are directly related to spore and pollen counts.Test samplers used included a high-volume cyclonic liquid impinger (SpinCon) and a standard spore trap (Burkard). Samples were collected on a weekly basis from May to October and were analyzed microscopically for spores and pollen grains. The liquid samples were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunoassay for the presence of allergens from Alternaria, Cladosporium, Aspergillus, oak, fescue, ragweed, and plantain. Specific Alternaria allergens Alt al and GP70 also were measured.Pollen counts for the SpinCon and Burkard collectors were similar, though spore counts were lower with the SpinCon. Detectable amounts of three of the seven allergenic species including fescue, ragweed, and Alternaria were present in air samples. Concentrations of pollens were seen in their respective seasons while fungal allergen levels varied throughout the period. Allergen levels generally agreed with particle counts, however peak allergen levels and peak particle counts for individual species did not correlate well.At flow rates of 236 L/min, the SpinCon is comparable to the Burkard for counting airborne pollen and spores. Samples collected by the SpinCon permit quantitative determination of allergen levels in outdoor air. The poor correlation between measured airborne allergen and related particles indicates the potential for significant allergen exposure in the absence of identifiable particles in air.",2000,10674565,no
Quantification of fungal DNA by using fluorescence resonance energy transfer and the light cycler system.,"The Light Cycler technique combines rapid in vitro amplification of DNA in glass capillaries with real-time species determination and quantification of DNA load. We have established a quantitative PCR protocol for two clinically important pathogens, Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. The sensitivity of the assay was comparable to those of previously described PCR protocols (5 CFU/ml). Specific detection of C. albicans and A. fumigatus could be achieved. The assay showed a high reproducibility of 96 to 99%. The assay was linear in a range between 10(1) and 10(4) Aspergillus conidia. As capillaries do not have to be reopened for post-PCR analysis, the risk of carryover contaminations could be minimized. The Light Cycler allowed quantification of the fungal loads in a limited number of clinical specimens from patients with hematological malignancies and histologically proven invasive fungal infections. Five of nine positive samples had fungal loads between 5 and 10 CFU/ml of blood, two of nine positive samples had fungal loads between 10 and 100 CFU/ml of blood, and two of nine samples had fungal loads of more than 100 CFU/ml of blood. All samples were also found to be PCR positive by PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis.",2000,10655350,no
Immunodetection of CD45 epitopes on the surface of Candida albicans cells in culture and infected human tissues.,"Candida albicans is a leading cause of disseminated fungal infection in immunocompromised patients. Candida-host cell interactions are mediated at the cell surface. Since blood-group I epitopes have been detected on the surface of C albicans cells, we investigated whether CD45, the molecule that carries the I antigen on human lymphocytes, is present on the C albicans cell surface, in culture and in human tissue specimens of human candidiasis. By using monoclonal antibodies to CD45, CD45RO, and CD45RA, we found a strong immunoreactivity at the cell surface of blastoconidia bearing germ tubes but weak or no immunostaining of the germ tubes themselves. In human tissues, immunostaining of C albicans yeast cells was detected, whereas pseudohyphae were mostly negative. CD45 epitopes on the surface of C albicans might have a role in tissue invasion and dissemination of the fungus. On the other hand, its detection may disturb quantitative non-morphology-based determinations of lymphoid cell populations in infected tissues.",2000,10631858,no
New developments in the diagnosis and management of invasive fungal infections.,"Invasive fungal infections in cancer patients are on the increase. Candidemia is now the fourth leading cause of bloodstream infections in many intensive care units (ICUs). Although a number of risk factors have been identified, antifungal therapy should not be started in non-neutropenic patients until a diagnosis of invasive candidiasis or candidemia is made or presumed in order to avoid the development of resistance. Even a single positive blood culture should be treated, and requires removal of intravascular lines. Fluconazole is the first line agent for treatment candidemia other than that caused by Candida glabrata or C. krusei. High-resolution CT scan pictures showing a halo sign or crescent air sign are helpful for establishing the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. Sandwich ELISA can be used to detect circulating galactomannan in serial serum samples. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of blood samples may also be used. There are only a few randomized studies of newly developed antifungal drugs compared to conventional amphotericin B (AmB). So far, both AmB colloidal dispersion and AmB lipid complex have failed to show more favorable efficacy or lesser toxicity rates, except for nephrotoxicity. Liposomal AmB, used during febrile neutropenia, did have a significantly lower toxicity rate. In neutropenic patients with invasive fungal infections liposomal AmB proved to be better than conventional AmB in terms of clinical efficacy, mortality and nephrotoxicity rates. The use of tests to achieve an earlier diagnosis combined with more potent treatment formulations such as liposomal AmB may be significant steps towards successful management of invasive fungal infections.",2000,10629598,no
ImmunoCAP and HY*TEC enzyme immunoassays in the detection of allergen-specific IgE compared with serial skin end-point titration by receiver operating characteristic analysis.,"In this study, we compared 2 different immunoassays, HY*TEC enzyme immunoassay (Hycor Biomedical Inc, Garden Grove, CA) and Pharmacia Upjohn ImmunoCAP (Pharmacia and Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI) using skin end-point titration as a gold standard by receiver operating characteristic analysis.One hundred patients were enrolled in this study and were tested with the above 3 modalities. The results were analyzed by receiver operating characteristic analysis, in which the curves give a decision criterion for any diagnostic test relative to its sensitivity and specificity against an accepted gold standard test. Only inhalant allergens (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farina, cat dander, giant ragweed, English plantain weed, timothy grass, Alternaria tenuis, Aspergillus fumigatus, meadow fescue, oak tree, white ash tree, and lamb's-quarter weed) were studied.The results obtained with both ImmunoCAP and HY*TEC showed a good correlation with skin end-point titration for D pteronyssinus, D farina, cat dander, giant ragweed, timothy grass, A tenuis, and meadow fescue, with sensitivities ranging from 71% to 88%. However, the sensitivity of both tests to English plantain weed, lamb's-quarter weed, oak tree, and white ash tree was lower (66% down to 39%). Additionally, HY*TEC results were not satisfactory for detecting specific IgE to A fumigatus (30% sensitivity). The overall sensitivity for each test was 65.67% for the HY*TEC and 71.25% for the ImmunoCAP.The 2 in vitro testing systems are comparable for most of the allergens, except for A fumigatus, English plantain, lamb's-quarter, and white ash tree ImmunoCAP and HY*TEC would benefit from improved technology for detecting these specific IgE antibodies. The HY*TEC assay did not give acceptable results for A fumigatus. The overall assay characteristics were good to excellent for each system tested.",2000,10629485,no
Evaluation of sandwich ELISA galactomannan test in samples of positive LA test and positive aspergillus antibody.,"The detection of circulating Aspergillus galactomannan antigen is a useful tool for serodiagnosis of aspergillosis. However, the latex agglutination test for the detection of galactomannan is not completely reliable due to it's low sensitivity. The sandwich ELISA was developed to achieve high sensitivity.The sandwich immunocapture ELISA was evaluated by testing 56 sero-positive and 56 sero-negative samples of circulating galactomannan detected by LA test retrospectively.Sixty of the samples were positive for galactomannan as measured by sandwich ELISA. Fifteen samples out of 56 samples negative by LA test were positive by ELISA and 4 samples out of 56 samples positive by LA test were negative by ELISA. Among 47 serum samples positive for anti-Aspergillus antibody, 14 samples were positive by ELISA.In conclusion, galactomannan may be detected in more samples of by the new sandwich ELISA than by LA test.",2000,10628932,no
Aspergillus Fumigatus antigen detection in sera from patients at risk for invasive aspergillosis.,"We have developed an inhibition enzyme immunoassay (inhibition-EIA) to monitor for the occurrence of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in sera from 45 immunocompromised (IC) patients. The test uses rabbit polyclonal antibodies and a mixture of components from Aspergillus fumigatus, containing three predominant antigens with molecular weights of 18,000, 33,000, and 56,000. Circulating antigens were found in five of seven proven cases of IA due to A. fumigatus. In two of the five positive cases, antigenemia was detected with inhibition-EIA earlier than with X ray or other biological methods. No antigens were detected in the sera from two patients with proven IA due to Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus terreus nor in the sera from four patients with probable IA. Circulating antigens were not detected in the control group, composed of 30 healthy adult blood donors. Four of the 32 at-risk patients examined, though they displayed no definite evidence of IA, gave a positive result in this test. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of inhibition-EIA were 71.4, 94.4, and 71.2%, respectively. The data were compared with those obtained by a latex agglutination assay of galactomannan (GM) that was positive in only one patient with probable IA. The higher sensitivity obtained by inhibition-EIA may well be due to its ability to detect circulating antigens other than GM in the sera of IC patients with IA. Detecting these antigens may improve the diagnosis of IA, as they may serve as markers of this infection.",2000,10618137,no
Characterization of the kexin-like maturase of Aspergillus niger.,"Secreted yields of foreign proteins may be enhanced in filamentous fungi through the use of translational fusions in which the target protein is fused to an endogenous secreted carrier protein. The fused proteins are usually separated in vivo by cleavage of an engineered Kex2 endoprotease recognition site at the fusion junction. We have cloned the kexin-encoding gene of Aspergillus niger (kexB). We constructed strains that either overexpressed KexB or lacked a functional kexB gene. Kexin-specific activity doubled in membrane-protein fractions of the strain overexpressing KexB. In contrast, no kexin-specific activity was detected in the similar protein fractions of the kexB disruptant. Expression in this loss-of-function strain of a glucoamylase human interleukin-6 fusion protein with an engineered Kex2 dibasic cleavage site at the fusion junction resulted in secretion of unprocessed fusion protein. The results show that KexB is the endoproteolytic proprotein processing enzyme responsible for the processing of (engineered) dibasic cleavage sites in target proteins that are transported through the secretion pathway of A. niger.",2000,10618249,no
Fungi associated with black tea and tea quality in the Sultanate of Oman.,"Forty-eight samples of four popular commercial brands of black tea (Camellia sinensis L.) were purchased from the local markets in Muscat area, Sultanate of Oman. Tea leaves were surveyed for mycoflora. Five fungal species were isolated with A. niger as the most dominant in all the brands having percentage contamination ranging between 0.66% and 30.34%. Other fungi isolated were Aspergillusflavus, Penicillium spp. and Pacelomyces spp. but having average percentages of 0.6%, 0.84% and 0.21% respectively. Significant differences were found among the batches contaminated by A. niger. None of the 25 A. flavus strains screened for aflatoxins were found aflatoxigenic. The total ash, water-soluble ash, and mineral concentration of the samples were within the British standards and were not affected by fungal contamination. The results showed that black tea is contaminated by fungi that might constitute health hazards for humans. The post harvest contamination of tea could be eliminated or reduced if processing is conducted under more hygienic conditions.",1999,10598069,no
Experimental paracoccidioidomycosis in hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus): gestational interactions.,"Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a dimorphic fungus presenting specific steroid hormone receptors, both in the yeast and mycelial forms and estrogen inhibits the transition from mycelium to yeast. In the acute phase, the disease occurs with equal frequency in both sexes but in adults, females are spared. Placental fungal infection has been reported, but references to fetal infection have not been confirmed. We used 78 Syrian female hamsters divided into 3 groups: GI consisted of 30 infected mated females, GII of 20 infected unmated females and GIII of 28 uninfected mated females. Animals of group I were mated 4 weeks after infection and half of them were submitted to cesarean section on day 15 after successful mating the other half was maintained and submitted to cesarean section and sacrificed 14 weeks after infection. Half of the animals of group II were sacrificed seven weeks and the other half 14 weeks after infection. Uninfected animals of group III were treated the same as the animals of group I. The animals were infected with strain 18 of P. brasiliensis by the intracardiac route. We evaluated the disease by the volume of granulomas in different organs, number of fungi in liver and spleen and the immunologic responses [ELISA, Double Immunodifusion (DID), Delayed Hypersensitivity Skin Test (DHT) and Macrophage Migration Inhibition (MMI)]. We studied the infection through the gestation by evaluation of the abortions, morphologic and clinic examinations of the fetuses. Our results showed that the infection did not transfer to the fetus through the placenta, but the number of abortions was larger among infected females. The newborns of GI females were smaller, weighed less and showed little vitality. The disease was more severe and disseminated in infected mated females, especially in the second sacrifice 14 weeks after inoculation, when the total volume of granulomas in them (56.3 mm) was much greater than in the infected unmated females (12 mm).",1999,10598068,no
Hydrolytic properties of a beta-mannosidase purified from Aspergillus niger.,"A beta-mannosidase was purified to homogeneity from the culture filtrate of Aspergillus niger. A specific activity of 500 nkat mg-1 and a 53-fold purification was achieved using ammonium sulfate precipitation, anion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. The isolated enzyme has an isoelectric point of 5.0 and appears to be a dimer composed of two 135-kDa subunits. It is a glycoprotein and contains 17% N-linked carbohydrate by weight. Maximal activity was observed at pH 2.4 5.0 and at 70 degrees C. The beta-mannosidase hydrolyzed beta-1,4-linked manno-oligosaccharides of degree of polymerization (DP) 2-6 and also released mannose from polymeric ivory nut mannan and galactomannan. The Km and Vmax values for p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-mannopyranoside were 0.30 mM and 500 nkat mg-1, respectively. Hydrolysis of D-galactose substituted manno-oligosaccharides showed that the beta-mannosidase was able to cleave up to, but not beyond, a side group. An internal peptide sequence of 15 amino acids was highly similar to that of an Aspergillus aculeatus beta-mannosidase belonging to family 2 of glycosyl hydrolases.",1999,10553664,no
A novel signal amplification technology for ELISA based on catalyzed reporter deposition. Demonstration of its applicability for measuring aflatoxin B(1).,"In an earlier communication we have described a novel signal amplification technology termed Super-CARD, which is able to significantly improve antigen detection sensitivity in conventional Dot-ELISA by approximately 10(5)-fold. The method utilizes hitherto unreported synthesized electron rich proteins containing multiple phenolic groups which, when immobilized over a solid phase as blocking agent, markedly increases the signal amplification capability of the existing CARD method (Bhattacharya, R., Bhattacharya, D., Dhar, T.K., 1999. A novel signal amplification technology based on catalyzed reporter deposition and its application in a Dot-ELISA with ultra high sensitivity. J. Immunol. Methods 227, 31.). In this paper we describe the utilization of this Super-CARD amplification technique in ELISA and its applicability for the rapid determination of aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)) in infected seeds. Using this method under identical conditions, the increase in absorbance over the CARD method was approximately 400%. The limit of detection of AFB(1) by this method was 0.1 pg/well, the sensitivity enhancement being 5-fold over the optimized CARD ELISA. Furthermore, the total incubation time was reduced to 16 min compared to 50 min for the CARD method. Assay specificity was not adversely affected and the amount of AFB(1) measured in seed extracts correlated well with the values obtained by conventional ELISA.",1999,10594355,no
Detection by ELISA of the humoral immune response in rabbits naturally infected with Trichophyton mentagrophytes.,"An indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed and its diagnostic potential evaluated for rabbits infected by Trichophyton mentagrophytes. Within-run and between-run coefficient of variance varied from 2.3 to 7.7% and from 5.9 to 8.5%, respectively, indicating satisfactory reproducibility of the ELISA. There was no significant cross-reaction with antigens of Microsporum canis, Malassezia pachydermatis and Aspergillus fumigatus. The level of specific IgG to Trichophyton mentagrophytes was measured in sera of 25 11-week-old and 12 younger infected rabbits. There was no significant difference in the IgG level between 12 5-week-old infected rabbits and controls (p = 0.38). The antibody response was higher in 12 7-week-old rabbits compared with controls (p = 0.001). The IgG level in 25 11-week-old rabbits differed from the controls very significantly (p < 0.0001). Increased specific IgG in 11-week-old rabbits exhibited 96% sensitivity and 94% specificity. Predictive values of a positive and a negative test were 96 and 94%, respectively. Western immunoblotting associated three protein bands (21.5, 31, 44 kDa) with Trichophyton mentagrophytes infection.",1999,10591499,no
Sensitization to Aspergillus species in the congenital neutrophil disorders chronic granulomatous disease and hyper-IgE syndrome.,"Hyper-IgE syndrome (HIE) and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) are congenital immunodeficiency diseases with increased susceptibility to bacterial and fungal infections. Both carry significant morbidity and mortality rates because of invasive infections by Aspergillus species. We encountered 2 patients, one with HIE and one with CGD, in whom detection of sensitization to Aspergillus species preceded the diagnosis of immunodeficiency. With high-dose systemic corticosteroids for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), an inflammatory disorder caused by sensitization to Aspergillus species, pulmonary abscesses developed in the patient with HIE, and the patient with CGD succumbed to an overwhelming Aspergillus species-induced pneumonia.We sought to assess the prevalence of sensitization to Aspergillus fumigatus and the presence of diagnostic criteria for ABPA in patients with CGD and HIE.We measured A fumigatus-specific serum IgE, IgG, and precipitating antibodies as indicators for A fumigatus sensitization in the sera of 18 patients with neutrophil disorders (7 with HIE and 11 with CGD). Hospital records were reviewed for the presence of other diagnostic criteria for ABPA (asthma, elevated total serum IgE concentration, and radiographic abnormalities).Twelve (67%) of 18 patients were sensitized to A fumigatus, as evidenced by precipitating A fumigatus-specific antibodies. Six (33%) of 18 patients had serologic evidence of ABPA. Five of those 6 patients had radiologic abnormalities consistent with a diagnosis of ABPA. One patient with HIE also had asthma, thus fulfilling minimal essential criteria for concurrent ABPA.Patients with HIE syndrome and CGD have a high incidence of sensitization to Aspergillus species. A clinical picture indistinguishable from ABPA may coexist or emerge in patients with CGD or HIE and create a major management dilemma because systemic corticosteroids may accelerate tissue damage and invasive fungal infections. It is important to distinguish individuals with congenital neutrophil disorders from uncomplicated classic ABPA.",1999,10589011,no
Antifungal type 1 responses are upregulated in IL-10-deficient mice.,"C57BL/6 mice are highly resistant to infections caused by Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. To elucidate the role of IL-10 produced by C57BL/6 mice during these infections, parameters of infection and immunity to it were evaluated in IL-10-deficient and wild-type mice with disseminated or gastrointestinal candidiasis or invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Unlike parasitic protozoan infection, C. albicans or A. fumigatus infection did not induce significant acute toxicity in IL-10-deficient mice, who, instead, showed reduced fungal burden and fungal-associated inflammatory responses. The increased resistance to infections as compared to wild-type mice was associated with upregulation of innate and acquired antifungal Th1 responses, such as a dramatically higher production of IL-12, nitric oxide (NO) and TNF-alpha as well as IFN-gamma by CD4+ T cells. Pharmacological inhibition of NO production greatly reduced resistance to gastrointestinal candidiasis, thus pointing to the importance of IL-10-dependent NO regulation at mucosal sites in fungal infections. These results are reminiscent of those obtained in genetically susceptible mice, in which IL-10 administration increased, and IL-10 neutralization decreased, susceptibility to C. albicans and A. fumigatus infections. Collectively, these observations indicate that the absence of IL-10 augments innate and acquired antifungal immunity by upregulating type 1 cytokine responses. The resulting protective Th1 responses lead to a prompt reduction of fungal growth, thus preventing tissue destruction and lethal levels of proinflammatory cytokines.",1999,10580272,no
Nasal zygomycosis and pulmonary aspergillosis in an American bison.,"Concomitant nasal zygomycosis and pulmonary aspergillosis was diagnosed in a 3-mo-old female American bison calf (Bison bison) in Pennsylvania (USA). Etiologic diagnosis was made by immunohistochemistry using a panel of monoclonal antibodies and heterologously absorbed polyclonal antibodies. In the lungs fungal infection was accompanied by hemorrhage, fibrin exudation, and infiltration with neutrophils. Fungi were observed to penetrate apparently normal epithelial lining of the nasal turbinates, and there was hemorrhage, edema, and invasion of blood vessels in the submucosa. In vessels fungi were typically associated with thrombosis. The calf may have been infected due to a high level of exposure to mouldy feed and litter in the environment in combination with a collapse of it's natural defence mechanisms.",1999,10574543,no
New perspectives in the diagnosis of systemic fungal infections.,"Profound and prolonged neutropenia following chemotherapy is a major risk factor for systemic fungal infections. Mortality associated with disseminated fungal infection is high, and treatment with conventional amphotericin B is complicated by renal toxicity. Candida and Aspergillus are among the major pathogens in these patients. Many patients remaining neutropenic over a prolonged period of time will receive empirical antifungal therapy. The clinical and laboratory diagnoses of these infections are neither sensitive nor specific and are generally limited in the early detection of invasive fungal infection. However, several new approaches to diagnosis are being developed, which should be translated into routine practice, based on a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of systemic fungal infection and virulence determinants of fungal pathogens. These include antigen detection and polymerase chain reaction. Patients with presumed fungal infection require more intense and accurate monitoring for signs of disseminated infection. Early diagnosis may guide appropriate treatment and prevent mortality. Continued development of commercial tests should help achieve the objective of definitive diagnostic tests for systemic fungal infections.",1999,10574505,no
The use of an in-house modified double antibody sandwich ELISA to detect Aspergillus antigens in sera of immunosuppressed patients.,"The purpose of this study was to retrospectively detect Aspergillus antigens in sera obtained from immunocompromised host using an in-house modified double antibody sandwich ELISA.The ELISA employed the use of polyclonal antibodies raised against a water-soluble (WS) mycelial component of a clinical isolate of Aspergillus fumigatus. Rabbit and guinea-pig anti-WS antibodies were used as the capture and detector antibodies respectively. This was followed by the addition of anti-guinea pig antibodies conjugated to horse radish peroxidase and orthophenylenediamine.Of 143 specimens obtained from 140 patients, only 5 (3.5%) specimens demonstrated the presence of antigen. The 5 antigen-positive sera were from three patients. One was a confirmed case of paranasal aspergillosis and the other two were probable cases of invasive aspergillosis.The clinical validity of the ELISA should be determined by prospective detection of Aspergillus antigens in multiple serum samples collected from proven cases of invasive aspergillosis.",1999,10572490,no
"A comparative study of Mono Mac 6 cells, isolated mononuclear cells and Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay in pyrogen testing.","Pyrogen induced secretion of interleukin 6 (IL-6) in Mono Mac 6 (MM6) cells was measured. The ability of the MM6 cell culture to detect pyrogens was compared to the Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) test and isolated mononuclear cells (MNC). The detection limit of MM6 for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Staphylococcus aureus was comparable to that of MNC. Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans induced IL-6 in isolated MNC, but not in MM6. The detection limit for Salmonella typhimurium in the MM6 assay was comparable to that of the LAL assay. As expected, S. aureus and C. albicans did not show any LAL activity. A. niger and Influenza virus showed some activity in the LAL test, but could not be detected by MM6 cells. In conclusion, the MM6 assay is a good supplement to the current pyrogen assays for detection of LPS, S. aureus and S. typhimurium, but the MM6 assay could not detect A. niger, C. albicans and Influenza virus.",1999,10564840,no
A polymerase chain reaction enzyme immunoassay for diagnosing infection caused by Aspergillus fumigatus.,"To develop a polymerase chain reaction enzyme immunoassay (PCR-EIA) to measure levels of circulating aspergillus DNA in invasive aspergillosis caused by Aspergillus fumigatus.The PCR reaction was based on primers from the 18s rRNA gene. Binding of the product to a streptavidin coated microtitration plate was mediated by a biotinylated capture probe. The product was digoxigenylated during PCR and this was the tag to which antibody was bound in the subsequent EIA.The optical density (OD) endpoint was < 0.1 in 10 sera from neutropenic patients with no evidence of invasive aspergillosis, and in 10 sera from nonneutropenic patients with bacterial pneumonia (group 1). The OD from five of 12 patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) (group 2), three with an aspergilloma (group 3), and five with possible invasive aspergillosis (group 4) was > or = 0.1. In 63 sera from 33 cases of proven invasive aspergillosis (group 5) an OD > or = 0.1 was achieved in 48 sera from 30 patients. The maximum OD was 0.510. The level fell in survivors and gradually rose in fatal cases.This assay validated the concept of diagnosing invasive aspergillosis by measuring levels of circulating fungal DNA in serum.",1999,10562808,no
Cytokine profile of a long-term pediatric HIV survivor with hyper-IgE syndrome and a normal CD4 T-cell count.,"An elevated IgE level and increased production of T(H2) cytokines are factors associated with poor prognosis in HIV infection. We report a pediatric long-term survivor of vertically acquired HIV infection with a normal CD4 count and a low viral burden despite the lack of antiretroviral therapy and a phenotype resembling hyper-IgE syndrome.We sought to characterize the patient's T(H1) versus T(H2) cytokine profile and anti-HIV-specific immune responses.Supernatants collected from cultures of peripheral blood T cells stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate plus ionomycin were assayed for T(H1) and T(H2) cytokines by means of ELISA. Specific IgE antibodies were determined by immunoblot. HIV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses were measured from cell lysis by fresh T cells of autologous B-lymphoblastoid cells expressing recombinant HIV proteins.Patient CD4(+) T cells secreted significantly more T(H2) cytokines, IL-4 (P <.003) and IL-5 (P <.03), than HIV-infected and seronegative control cells. No difference was noted in T(H1) cytokine production. IgE specific for HIV gp160, p24, p17, and p66 proteins and Aspergillus fumigatus was detected in patient sera. Despite predominance of T(H2) cytokines, HIV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity was vigorous.The patient demonstrated predominantly T(H2) cytokine production in vitro. Unlike other patients with HIV who have hyper-IgE and increased T(H2) cytokine production, our patient has maintained HIV-specific immune responses, a low viral load, and a normal CD4 count without antiretroviral therapy. These findings support a diagnosis of primary hyper-IgE syndrome. Presence of anti-HIV-specific IgE may represent a protective mechanism against HIV replication in our patient.",1999,10550751,no
Use of monoclonal antibody in diagnosis of candidiasis caused by Candida albicans: detection of circulating aspartyl proteinase antigen.,"To develop a serological diagnosis of invasive candidiasis based on detection of circulating secreted aspartyl proteinase (SAP) antigen of Candida albicans, three different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were compared. The first was a standard ELISA to detect anti-SAP antibodies, and the others were an antigen capture ELISA and an inhibition ELISA to detect circulating SAP antigen with monoclonal antibody (MAb) CAP1, which is highly specific for SAP. These tests were applied to 33 serum samples retrospectively selected from 33 patients with mycologically and/or serologically proven invasive candidiasis caused by C. albicans. Serum samples from 12 patients with aspergillosis and serum samples from 13 healthy individuals were also included. The sensitivities and specificities were 69.7 and 76.0% for the standard ELISA and 93.9 and 92.0% for the antigen capture ELISA, respectively. However, these values reached 93.9 and 96.0%, respectively, for the inhibition ELISA. Serum samples from 31 of 33 patients had detectable SAP antigen, with concentrations ranging from 6.3 to 19.0 ng/ml. These results indicate that the inhibition ELISA with MAb CAP1 is effective in detection of circulating SAP antigen and that this assay may be useful for diagnosis and treatment monitoring of invasive candidiasis.",1999,10548587,no
Expression and compartmentation of the glucose repressor CRE1 from the phytopathogenic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.,"The glucose repressor from the phytopathogenic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is encoded by the cre1 gene. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against a fusion protein (gluthathione S-transferase) GST-CRE1 in order to study cre1 expression. Western blot analyses revealed that CRE1 synthesis is regulated by the nature of the extracellular carbon source. High CRE1 levels are induced by glucose and remain stable after transfer into pectin medium, suggesting the existence of post-translational mechanisms which inactivate CRE1 to allow transcription of glucose-repressed genes. Subcellular fractionation demonstrated that CRE1 is localized in the nuclei of glucose grown hyphae and in the cytoplasm when glucose is removed from the culture medium. CRE1 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) was introduced into Aspergillus nidulans. Fluorescence microscopy showed the nuclear localization of the GFP-CRE1 fusion protein according to the presence of glucose in the culture medium, suggesting homologous post-translational regulations of glucose repressors in fungi. We propose that filamentous fungi regulate the activity of the glucose repressor by controlling its nuclear translocation.",1999,10542073,no
Sensitivity to the house dust mite and airway hyperresponsiveness in a young adult population.,"The pathogenic mechanisms of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in asthma are unknown and only a few studies have examined the importance of sensitivity to antigens in AHR in young adults.We investigated the correlation between AHR and sensitivity to specific antigens, atopy, history of childhood asthma and spirometry in a young adult population.Based on the results of interviews with 447 students at our university, 308 non-smoker students were classified into six groups. Group 1 comprised subjects with intermittent mild bronchial asthma group 2, subjects with history of childhood asthmaAirway hyperresponsiveness to MCh did not correlate with IgE-RIST, eosinophil count, or ECP. The highest AHR to MCh was present in groups 1 and 2 and lowest in groups 5 and 6. Multiple regression analysis showed that sensitivity to Def was the only factor that significantly influenced AHR to MCh. Airway hyperresponsiveness to MCh of groups with a RAST score for Def of 0/1 was lower than groups with a RAST score of 2 to 6. Airway hyperresponsiveness to MCh did not correlate with the degree of positivity to Def antigen among positive sensitized groups (RAST score 2 to 6).Sensitivity to mite antigen may be important in the pathogenesis of AHR and Def is a major contributing antigen in young adults in Japan. Once asthma occurs, AHR remains positive for a long time even after the disappearance of asthma-related symptoms.",1999,10541422,no
Immunoaffinity layering of enzymes. Stabilization and use in flow injection analysis of glucose and hydrogen peroxide.,"A general procedure for the high yield immobilization of enzymes with the help of specific anti-enzyme antibodies is described. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against Aspergillus niger glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase in rabbits and the gamma globulin (IgG) fraction from the immune sera isolated by ammonium sulphate fractionation followed by ion-exchange chromatography. Immobilization of glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase was achieved by initially binding the enzymes to a Sepharose matrix coupled with IgG isolated from anti-(glucose oxidase) and anti-(horseradish peroxidase) sera, respectively. This was followed by alternate incubation with the IgG and the enzyme to assemble layers of enzyme and antibody on the support. The immunoaffinity-layered preparations obtained thus were highly active and, after six binding cycles, the amount of enzyme immobilized could be raised about 25 times over that bound initially. It was also possible to assemble layers of glucose oxidase using unfractionated antiserum in place of the IgG. The bioaffinity-layered preparations of glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase exhibited good enzyme activities and improved resistance to heat-induced inactivation. The sensitivity of a flow injection analysis system for measuring glucose and hydrogen peroxide could be remarkably improved using immunoaffinity-layered glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase. For the detection of glucose, a Clark-type oxygen electrode, constructed as a small flow-through cell integrated with a cartridge bearing immunoaffinity-layered glucose oxidase was employed. The hydrogen peroxide concentration was analysed spectrophotometrically using a flow-through cell and the layered horseradish peroxidase packed into a cartridge. The immunoaffinity-layered enzymes could be conveniently solubilized at acid pH and fresh enzyme loaded onto the support. Immunoaffinity-layered glucose oxidase was successfully used for the on-line monitoring of the glucose concentration during the cultivation of Streptomyces cerevisiae.",1999,10531650,no
Fungal infections of the central nervous system.,"This review discusses a practical approach to the patient with possible fungal infection of the central nervous system (CNS). Difficulties in establishing the diagnosis come from the nonspecific clinical syndromes (subacute meningitis, meningoencephalitis, and brain abscess) and the low isolation rate of fungi from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Helpful diagnostic clues often come from knowledge of the patient's geographic travels, risk factors, evidence of systemic organ infection, and fungal serologic tests. Standard and new antifungal agents are evaluated and the initial and suppressive drug management of the common fungal infections is presented.",1999,10517927,no
Autopsy-controlled prospective evaluation of serial screening for circulating galactomannan by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for hematological patients at risk for invasive Aspergillosis.,"Efforts to improve the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) have been directed towards the detection of fungal antigens, including galactomannan (GM). However, previous evaluations of GM detection have been hampered by a lack of proven cases of IA and by a nonserial study design. This prospective study assessed the diagnostic value of serial screening for circulating GM by using a recently developed sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for prolonged-neutropenic and/or steroid-treated patients with hematological disorders. Serum GM levels were monitored twice weekly for 186 consecutive patients at increased risk for IA. The patients were stratified according to the likelihood of IA (proven, probable, possible, and no evidence of IA) by using stringent criteria. Proven IA was defined by characteristic histopathological findings together with a positive culture for Aspergillus species. Autopsy and culture from autopsy specimens was used to verify both positive and negative test results. A total of 2,172 serum samples were tested from 243 episodes (mean, 9 samples/episode). Based on the analysis of 71 patients with confirmed disease status (culture and histology), the sensitivity and specificity of serial GM monitoring were 92.6 and 95.4%, respectively. The positive predictive value was almost 93%, the negative predictive value was 95%, and the efficacy was 94%. False-positive reactions occurred at a rate of nearly 8%, although this figure might have been overestimated. Less than 1% of all tested sera were considered inconclusive. In more than half of the cases, antigenemia was detected before clinical suspicion of IA (median, 6 days before). Serial determination of serum GM by the sandwich ELISA technique is a sensitive tool for the diagnosis of IA in hematological patients at risk. This approach may substantially influence clinical management with regard to preemptive and empirical antifungal therapy.",1999,10488181,no
Skin test reactivity to 2 recombinant Aspergillus fumigatus allergens in A fumigatus-sensitized asthmatic subjects allows diagnostic separation of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis from fungal sensitization.,"Aspergillus fumigatus, an opportunistic pathogen, is associated with an impressive list of pulmonary complications. Among these, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) represents a complex clinical syndrome that is difficult to diagnose. A clear distinction between allergic sensitization to A fumigatus and ABPA is essential for therapy to prevent deterioration of pulmonary function in subjects with ABPA.This study was carried out to determine the specificity and sensitivity of 2 A fumigatus allergens for the in vivo diagnosis of ABPA.Serologic investigations with recombinant A fumigatus allergens indicated the existence of disease-specific allergens that are useful for discrimination between ABPA and fungal sensitization. However, serologic studies fail to indicate the allergen-specific IgE levels required to elicit an allergic reaction in vivo.We show that the recombinant A fumigatus allergens rAsp f 4, a protein with unknown biologic function, and rAsp f 6 (manganese superoxide dismutase) are able to provoke immediate skin reactions exclusively in patients with ABPA. The reactions, which are elicited by a few nonograms of the allergens, strictly depend on the presence of allergen-specific serum IgE. The IgE cut-off values for positive skin reactions to rAsp f 4 and rAsp f 6 of 0.9 and 1.2 kU(A)/L correspond to allergen-specific serum concentrations of 2 to 3 microg/L and allow a sensitive, highly specific diagnosis of ABPA.In contrast to fungal extracts, rAsp f 4 and rAsp f 6 allow discrimination between ABPA and sensitization to A fumigatus. Moreover, the allergens are suitable for an automated serologic diagnosis of ABPA, facilitating their introduction in clinical practice.",1999,10482834,no
Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis diagnosed early by polymerase chain reaction assay.,"We compared the usefulness of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the early diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis with the serodiagnosis of sufficient concentrations of galactomannan using the same serum samples. A patient was treated with prednisolone for the management of hepatitis. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed the nodular shadow with a cavity containing a clear fungus ball. DNA of Aspergillus spp. from a serum sample was detected and using the same serum sample, both latex agglutination and sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of galactomannan were negative. PCR assay provides an early diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis compared with ELISA of galactomannan.",1999,10480308,no
"Alkaline serine proteinase is a major allergen of Aspergillus flavus, a prevalent airborne Aspergillus species in the Taipei area.","Aspergillus species are prevalent indoor airborne fungi and have been identified to be a causative agent of human allergic disorders. In the present study, we identified, purified and characterized the allergen(s) from Aspergillus flavus, a predominant airborne Aspergillus species in the Taipei area.The IgE-binding components of A. flavus were identified by SDS-PAGE immunoblotting with sera from asthmatic patients. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the major allergens were determined by Edman degradation. The allergenic cross-reactivity among allergens from different fungi was analyzed by immunoblot inhibition using sera from asthmatic patients. The detected major allergen was purified from the culture medium. It was further characterized in terms of its N-terminal amino acid sequence, its IgE-binding activity and its enzymatic activity.The results of the immunoblot analysis indicate that a 34-kD component that has high IgE-binding (63%) frequency is a major allergen of A. flavus. The N-terminus of this 34-kD major allergen (GLTTQKSAP) has high sequence identity with that of the 34-kD alkaline serine proteinase major allergen of A. oryzae. Results from immunoblot inhibition studies indicate that IgE cross-reactivity occurs among the 34-kD major allergens of A. flavus, A. fumigatus and Penicillium citrinum. The 34-kD major allergen of A. flavus was purified from the culture medium by ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE ion exchange chromatography. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified allergen (Asp fl 13) is identical to that determined previously for the 34-kD major allergen in the crude extract of A. flavus. The IgE immunoblot reactivity to the 34-kD major allergen in the crude extract can be dose-dependently inhibited by the purified Asp fl 13. The degree of IgE binding to the 34-kD major allergen in the crude extract correlates with that of the purified Asp fl 13 in sera of 8 asthmatic patients. The purified Asp fl 13 has proteolytic activity with casein as substrate at pH 8.0. This enzymatic activity can be inhibited by either phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or diethylpyrocarbonate.Our results suggest that the 34-kD alkaline serine proteinase is a major allergen of A. flavus. There was IgE cross-reactivity among allergens of A. flavus, A. fumigatus and P. citrinum.",1999,10474033,no
"Occupational IgE sensitisation to phytase, a phosphatase derived from Aspergillus niger.","Phytase is a phosphatase derived from Aspergillus niger that enhances phosphate bioavailability in the gut, and therefore has been increasingly used as an animal feed additive since the early 1990s. The aim of this study was to assess whether work related respiratory symptoms among workers in a so called premix factory producing animal feed additives, could be due to type I (mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE) allergic sensitisation to phytase.Preparations of specific IgE against phytase as used in the factory were assessed by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) in serum samples of 11 exposed workers who regularly handled the enzyme, in 11 office and laboratory workers of the same plant (non-exposed internal controls), and in 19 laboratory animal workers as external controls. The factory workers also completed a questionnaire on common and work related respiratory symptoms.Depending on the cut off level in the EIA for IgE, and the preparation used as coated allergen, antiphytase sensitisation was found in one to four of the 19 external controls, in one to five of the 11 internal controls, and in four to 10 of the 11 exposed workers. Strongest IgE reactions were found in four exposed workers who reported work related respiratory symptoms, particularly wheezing, and in one internal control who possibly had become sensitised because the structure of the factory building did not preclude airborne exposure in the offices and corridors of the plant. Experiments with inhibition EIA for IgE showed that (a) phytase of another commercial source was only partially cross reactive with phytase as used in the premix factory, and (b) phytase used as an animal feed additive did not cross react with common mould extracts, except for extracts from the species of origin, Aspergillus niger. The amount of IgE binding phytase in Aspergillus niger was estimated to be between 0.1% and 1% of the extractable mould proteins.Phytase is a potentially important new occupational allergen causing specific IgE immune responses among exposed workers. Such IgE sensitisation could probably be the cause of work related asthmatic and other respiratory symptoms if no effective measures are taken to prevent airborne occupational exposure at sites where phytase is handled, particularly during addition of enzyme preparations to animal feed.",1999,10472316,no
Selective cloning of allergens from the skin colonizing yeast Malassezia furfur by phage surface display technology.,"The yeast Malassezia furfur, also known as Pityrosporum orbiculare (ovale), is part of the normal microflora of the human skin but has also been associated with different skin diseases including atopic dermatitis. More than 50% of atopic dermatitis patients have positive skin test and specific IgE to M. furfur extracts however, the pathophysiologic role of these IgE-mediated reactions in the development of the disease remains unknown. The yeast is able to produce a wide panel of IgE-binding proteins, variably recognized by sera of individual patients. In order to assess the contribution of individual components to the disease, highly pure allergen preparations are required. We have cloned M. furfur allergens from a cDNA library displayed on the phage surface, sequenced the inserts and produced recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. Phage displaying IgE-binding proteins were selectively enriched from the library using IgE from a M. furfur-sensitized atopic dermatitis patient as a ligand. We were able to identify five different inserts coding for IgE-binding polypeptides. Three of the sequenced cDNA encode incomplete gene products with molecular masses of 21.3 kDa (MF 7), 14.4 kDa (MF 8), and 9.7 kDa (MF 9), respectively, having no sequence similarity to known proteins. The other two cDNA encode allergens of 18.2 kDa (Mal f 5) and 17.2 kDa (Mal f 6). Mal f 5 shows significant homology to M. furfur allergens Mal f 2, Mal f 3 and an Aspergillus fumigatus allergen Asp f 3. Mal f 6 has significant homology with cyclophilin. All of the recombinant polypeptides were capable of binding serum IgE from atopic dermatitis patients in immunoblotting experiments. The availability of pure recombinant M. furfur allergens will allow the careful investigation of the role of IgE-binding proteins in atopic dermatitis.",1999,10469297,no
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis due to Aspergillus niger without bronchial asthma.,"A 65-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a dry cough and pulmonary infiltrates. Chest radiograph and CT revealed mucoid impaction and consolidations. Peripheral blood eosinophilia and elevated serum IgE were observed. Aspergillus niger was cultured repeatedly from her sputum, but A. fumigatus was not detected. Immediate skin test and specific IgE (RAST) to Aspergillus antigen were positive. Precipitating antibodies were confirmed against A. niger antigen, but not against A. fumigatus antigen. She had no asthmatic symptoms, and showed no bronchial hyperreactivity to methacholine. Thus, this case was diagnosed as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) without bronchial asthma due to A. niger, an organism rarely found in ABPA. The administration of prednisone improved the symptoms and corrected the abnormal laboratory findings.",1999,10461089,no

CSF samples were subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA), latex agglutination test (LA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cultures of CSF samples were negative in all the patients, but PCR, EIA and LA were positive in five, four and four patients with CNS aspergillosis, respectively. None of these tests were positive in the control patients. CSF examination may be beneficial in the diagnosis of CNS aspergillosis.",1999,10460619,no
Nitric oxide: a clinically important amniotic fluid marker to distinguish between intra-amniotic mycoplasma and non-mycoplasma infections.,"The objective of this study was to determine whether the measurements of amniotic fluid nitric oxide metabolite (NOx: nitrate + nitrite) concentrations could be a clinically useful marker to differentiate between intra-amniotic mycoplasma and nonmycoplasma infections. Amniocentesis was performed on 76 pregnant women with suspicion of intra-amniotic infection. Intra-amniotic infection was defined as the presence of a positive amniotic fluid culture with either mycoplasma or nonmycoplasma infections. Rapid amniotic fluid tests for Gram stain, glucose, leukocyte counts, interleukin-6, and NOx were performed. Amniotic fluid NOx was measured with aspergillus nitrate reductase and Griess reagent. Interleukin-6 was determined by enzyme immunoassays. Amniotic fluid NOx and interleukin-6 were normalized by amniotic fluid creatinine levels. Patients with intra-amniotic mycoplasma (n = 7) and nonmycoplasma infections (n = 8) had significantly higher amniotic fluid leukocyte counts and interleukin-6 concentrations and significantly lower amniotic fluid glucose levels than noninfected controls (n = 61). Amniotic fluid concentrations of NOx were significantly higher in those with intraamniotic nonmycoplasma infection as compared to those with intraamniotic mycoplasma infection and noninfected controls (NOx: 3.35+/-0.74 vs. 2.03+/-0.41 micromol/mg creatinine, p = 0.005, and 3.35+/-0.74 vs. 1.72+/-0.07 micromol/mg creatinine, p < 0.0001, respectively). However, patients with intra-amniotic mycoplasma infection did not differ significantly from noninfected controls. Our data indicate that clinical characteristics of intra-amniotic mycoplasma infection may differ from intra-amniotic nonmycoplasma infection. As delivery is not always indicated in intra-amniotic mycoplasma infection, elevated rapid amniotic fluid tests (leukocyte counts, interleukin-6, and glucose) may not be appropriate in the clinical management of intra-amniotic mycoplasma infection. In addition to these rapid amniotic fluid tests, incorporation of the measurement of amniotic fluid NOx may be of clinical importance in the differentiation and management of patients with suspected intra-amniotic mycoplasma and nonmycoplasma infection.",1999,10458527,no
Two novel mutations in a cystic fibrosis patient of Chinese origin.,"Cystic fibrosis is rare in non-Caucasian populations, and in such populations little is known about the spectrum of mutations and polymorphisms in the CFTR gene. We studied a 23-year-old patient of Chinese ethnicity with sweat chloride values of 104 mM/l, pancreatic sufficiency, an FEV1 60% of normal, sputum cultures positive for Staphylococcus aureus and Burkholderia cepacia, and a history of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Genetic screening for 31 common CFTR mutations was negative, leading us to search for unknown mutations using single-strand conformation polymorphism and heteroduplex analysis (SSCP/HA). Two novel mutations were detected. In exon 4, a deletion of 8 bp (451458, deltaGCTTCCTA) causes a frameshift and immediately creates a stop codon. In exon 16, mutation 3041G-->A causes the missense change G970D. Functional analysis using an isotopic flux assay indicated that the G970D mutation retains partial function western blotting indicated that the protein is glycosylated. The patient is heterozygous for the common polymorphisms (2694T/G) in exon 14a and (GATT)6/7 in intron 6a, indicating that these variants arose in ancestors common to Caucasians and Chinese.",1999,10453741,no
Cloning and characterization of the gene encoding Aspergillus nidulans DNA topoisomerase II.,"We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of a 5544bp genomic DNA fragment from Aspergillus nidulans that encodes DNA topoisomerase II (topo II). It contains a single open reading frame of 4740bp that codes for 1579 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 178kDa when expressed in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae the molecular weight was 180kDa. The gene (TOP2) is divided into three exons. Two introns, 54bp and 60bp in length, are located at nucleotide positions 187 and 3214 respectively. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with other eukaryotic topo II sequences showed a higher degree of identity with other fungal enzymes than the human topo IIalpha. One of monoclonal antibodies raised against human topo II, 6H8, can cross-react with Aspergillus topo II.",1999,10452949,no
Lung allograft dysfunction correlates with gamma-interferon gene expression in bronchoalveolar lavage.,"Preceding episodes of acute cellular rejection (ACR) may predispose lung allografts to the subsequent development of irreversible dysfunction or bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). Other histologic patterns such as bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP), organizing pneumonia, lymphocytic bronchiolitis and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) may also adversely affect allograft function. We have previously reported the predominant expression of Th1 cytokines (IL-2 and interferon gamma) in rejecting and Th2 (IL-10) in a tolerant model of rat lung transplantation. Here we correlate the ""Th1/Th2 paradigm"" in clinical lung transplantation with histologic findings and assess the effect on serial spirometric function.We examined the mRNA expression of IL-2, interferon gamma, IL-10 and ICAM-1 in 53 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens from 23 lung transplant (LT) recipients utilizing qualitative ""nested"" reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We also measured IgG1 and IgG2 levels in 44 BAL specimens by ELISA. The mRNA expression for cytokines, ICAM-1 and the IgG2/IgG1 ratios were correlated with the presence or absence of ACR and alternate ""histologic patterns"". Serial spirometry were analyzed for the 2-3 month interval before bronchoscopic (FOB) assessment to derive ""baseline"" forced expiratory volume-one second (FEV1) values. The change in FEV1 coincident with (deltaFEV1 pre) and for the 2-3 month interval subsequent to (deltaFEV1 post) FOB were expressed relative to ""baseline"" spirometric indexes.Detection of mRNA for interferon gamma and ICAM-1 correlated significantly with ACR, whereas IL-2 and IL-10 expression did not correlate. IL-10 was virtually ""ubiquitous"" in most BAL samples irrespective of the presence or absence of ACR. The highest correlation was observed with interferon gamma for acute cellular rejection whereupon the sensitivity was 77.7%, specificity 87.7%, positive predictive value 73.6% and negative predictive value 88.2%, although for ICAM-1 these values were 75%, 65.7%, 50.0% and 85.0%, respectively. Nevertheless, 4 of 5 episodes of respiratory tract infection (bacterial, CMV, Aspergillus spp.) were similarly associated with cytokine mRNA. The ratios of IgG2 to IgG1, a reflection of Th1/Th2 influence, were not statistically different when analyzed for the presence or absence of ACR (0.91+/-0.53 vs. 1.02+/-0.70, respectively p = NS). By analysis of FEV1 trends, expression of interferon gamma was associated with a greater and persistent decrement (deltaFEV1 pre: -0.265+/-0.78 liters, and post: -0.236+/-0.1161Our findings suggest that interferon gamma mRNA expression and ICAM-1 may be valuable in both the diagnosis and prognosis for lung allograft ACR. IL-10, a Th2 cytokine, was locally expressed both in the presence and absence of ACR. Expression of mRNA for interferon y in BAL and, to a lesser extent ICAM-1, were associated with increased lung allograft dysfunction. Whether BAL cytokine ""immunosurveillance"" would complement or possibly supplant a specific ""histologic pattern"" and thereby direct different therapies after lung transplantation, may be potentially rewarding areas of further investigation.",1999,10452338,no
Exposure-response relations of alpha-amylase sensitisation in British bakeries and flour mills.,"To describe the levels of exposure to fungal alpha-amylase in British bakeries and flour mills, and to describe the relation between exposure to alpha-amylase and sensitisation to fungal alpha-amylase.495 personal flour dust samples were taken in seven British bakeries and flour mills and analysed for alpha-amylase with an immunoassay. Workers at the sites were asked to fill out questionnaires on work related symptoms, smoking history, and work history, and they were skin prick tested with common allergens and fungal alpha-amylase to assess sensitisation.Exposure to high concentrations of alpha-amylase occur in a few areas of British bakeries and flour mills, and there can be considerable differences in exposures to alpha-amylase between sites and between exposure groups, and even within similar exposure groups from different sites. Exposure to the highest concentrations of alpha-amylase was found in the dispensing and mixing areas of the bakeries (geometric mean (GM) 39.7 ng/m3). Exposure to alpha-amylase showed only a moderate correlation with concentrations of dust (r = 0.42) and flour aeroallergen (r = 0.46). The results also showed a relation between exposure to alpha-amylase and sensitisation to fungal alpha-amylase (prevalence ratio (PR) for medium exposure 3.9, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.8 to 20.2, PR for high exposure 9.9, 95% CI 2.8 to 34.6) compared with the low exposure category). Atopic subjects had an increased risk of sensitisation, but this was not significant.This study suggests that exposure to alpha-amylase is a considerable health risk in British bakeries and flour mills. A small proportion of workers are exposed to alpha-amylase at concentrations that result in high rates of sensitisation. A reduction in exposure to alpha-amylase is likely to reduce this risk.",1999,10448329,no
"Characterization of a novel allergen, a major IgE-binding protein from Aspergillus flavus, as an alkaline serine protease.","Aspergillus species of fungi have been known to be one of the most prevalent aeroallergens. One important A. flavus allergen (Asp fl 1) was identified by means of immunoblotting with a serum pool of allergic patients on a two-dimensional electrophoretic gel. The cDNA coding for Asp fl 1 was cloned and sequenced. The clone encodes a full-length protein of 403 amino acid precursors of 42 kDa. After cleavage of a putative signal peptide of 21 amino acids and a prepeptide of 100 amino acids, a mature protein of 282 amino acids was obtained with a molecular mass of 33 kDa and a pI of 6.3. A degree of identity was found in a range of 27 to 84% among related allergens derived from bacteria allergen subtilisin, mold allergen Pen c 1, and virulence factor of A. fumigatus. Recombinant Asp fl 1 (rAsp fl 1) was cloned into vector pQE-30 and expressed in E. coli M15 as a histidine-tag fusion protein and purified to homogeneity. The IgE binding capacity of rAsp fl 1 was tested by immunoblotting using a serum pool of Aspergillus-allergic patients. Recombinant allergen cross-reacted strongly with IgE specific for natural Asp fl 1 and Pen c 1, indicating that common IgE epitopes may exist between allergens of A. flavus and P. citrinum.",1999,10441484,no
Chemical and immunochemical characterization of limulus factor G-activating substance of Candida spp.,"The limulus test is a well-established method for the diagnosis of both gram (-) sepsis and invasive fungal infection. To diagnose deep-seated fungal infections, a (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan-specific chromogenic kit (Fungitec G test MK) has been developed and applied clinically. It is suggested that the limulus reactive substance was released from the fungi to the blood, however, its chemical properties were not precisely examined in detail because of the limited quantity available. In this study, we used chemically defined liquid medium to culture Candida spp. and collected the water soluble fraction, CAWS. The yield of CAWS was circa 100 mg/l, independent of the strain of Candida. CAWS reacted with limulus factor G (Fungitec G test MK) at concentrations as low as 100 ng/ml. Limulus factor G reactivity of CAWS was sensitive to (1-->3)-beta-glucanase, zymolyase and was, at least in part, bound to ConA-agarose. The ConA-bound fraction also reacted with anti-beta-glucan antibody. CAWS is mainly composed of mannan and (1-->6)-beta-glucan, in addition to protein, assessed by 1H-NMR spectroscopy. CAWS also reacted with typing sera of Candida spp., specific for cell wall mannan. Chemical, immunochemical and biochemical analyses of CAWS strongly suggested that the limulus factor G-activating substance was a mannan-beta-glucan complex, present within the architecture of the yeast cell wall.",1999,10435760,no
[Non-culture based laboratory diagnosis of sepsis].,"Blood culture is clearly the most important diagnostic procedure for sepsis. In the majority of cases, however, it yields negative results when bacterial or fungal sepsis is strongly suspected in view of an excellent response to antibacterial or antifungal medication. This is likely because infecting microbes have already been too seriously damaged in the blood stream to grow in culture media. Therefore, various tests have been devised to detect cellular components of pathogens including endotoxin for gram-negative bacteria, (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan for fungi, a non-mannan heat-labile candida antigen, glucronoxylomannan for Cryptococcus neoformans, and galactomannan for Aspergillus. The first two tests are particularly suitable for screening purposes, because, in addition to their high sensitivity and specificity, they cover a wide range of species in each category, though not as widely as blood culture. The candida antigen detectable by Candi-Tec is probably a complex of immune-related proteins, and appears to be a poor indicator in immunocompromised hosts. Glucronoxylomannan has been established as a useful marker of cryptococcosis, whereas galactomannan, though highly specific for aspergillosis, needs a more sensitive detection system to be useful for diagnostic purposes.",1999,10434564,no
Prevention and management of oral infections in cancer patients.,"The successful prevention and management of oral infections and infections from the oral cavity in cancer patients are based on identification of risk patients, selection of patients for prophylactic measures, diagnosis of infection and implementation of directed or empiric antimicrobial therapy. Identification of patients at risk for infection is based on each patient's type of oral microbial colonization and the presence of latent viral infections. Systemic and local resistance to infection will be decisive, and in many patients the risk can be estimated from the expected myelosuppressive effect of anticancer treatment. Diagnosis of infection is often based on clinical findings together with the results of microbiological investigations. Biopsies could be useful, but can seldom be obtained. Blood samples are mandatory for isolation of microorganisms involved in systemic infections in myelosuppressed patients. Prevention of infection requires both local and systemic measures. Elimination of the risk of a breach in the first line of defence is urgent, and the maintenance of mucosal integrity is important. Monitoring microbial colonization is common, as is the institution of antiviral prophylaxis in patients with increased anti-HSV IgG (ELISA > 10,000). Antifungal prophylaxis, to avoid colonization and superinfection, should be instituted in patients with low neutrophil counts. Gastrointestinal prophylaxis with quinolones is also commonly used in these patient groups. Treatment of oral infections in cancer patients should include systemic antimicrobial agents in most cases. Special attention should be directed to oral infections in neutropenic (< 0.5 x 10(9)/1) patients in whom oral microorganisms are the leading cause of bacteraemia. Invasive fungal infections of the oral cavity can be associated with systemic fungal infection and are indications for the use of liposomal amphotericin B.",1999,10423047,no
Frequent false-positive results of Aspergillus latex agglutination test: transient Aspergillus antigenemia during neutropenia.,"Two serologic assays, Aspergillus latex agglutination testing (LA) and plasma (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan (BDG) measurement, are used when invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is suspected. Despite the high specificity of these assays, false-positive results are frequent for neutropenic patients. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of LA and BDG and to investigate the cause of the false-positive results.Eighty-eight consecutive patients with hematologic malignancies who underwent intensive chemotherapy were tested weekly with LA and BDG.Sixteen of 88 patients were diagnosed as having IPA. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values were 23%, 98%, and 64% for LA and 27%, 88%, and 52% for BDG, respectively. Of 11 patients who became positive for LA only during neutropenic periods, 2 patients developed IPA. In contrast, six of eight patients who became positive for LA during nonneutropenic periods developed IPA. Transient Aspergillus antigenemia was more frequently encountered during neutropenia (2.9%) than during nonneutropenic periods (0.2%). The plasma BDG concentration increased at the nadir of neutropenia in 36 of 45 patients who had no signs of IPA, and it exceeded the level of 20 pg/mL in 2 patients.Both BDG and LA have a low sensitivity and a high specificity for IPA. However, the false-positive rate of LA increases during neutropenic periods. Caution should be exercised in interpreting the results of these blood tests, especially when patients are neutropenic.",1999,10421263,no
Solubilization of yeast cell-wall beta-(1-->3)-D-glucan by sodium hypochlorite oxidation and dimethyl sulfoxide extraction.,"The limulus test is a well-established method for the diagnosis of both Gram-negative sepsis and invasive fungal infection. To diagnose fungal infections, a beta-(1-->3)-D-glucan-specific chromogenic kit (Fungitec G test MK) has been developed and applied clinically. We are concentrating our main efforts on developing a better standard to improve the precision of this method. To this end, we have successfully developed a protocol to obtain a soluble Candida spp. beta-(1-->3)-D-glucan (CSBG) by sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) oxidation and subsequent dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) extraction (yield of 9.6 +/- 4.1%) of acetone-dried whole-cell preparations. The beta-glucan fraction is free from the cell-wall mannan, gives a symmetrical peak by gel filtration, and is soluble in dilute NaOH. The product is composed mainly of beta-(1-->3)- and beta-(1-->6)-D-glucosidic linkages. The specific activity of the beta-glucan is comparable with pachyman when combined with the Fungitec G test as the standard glucan and reacted as low as 10(-11) g/mL.",1999,10420595,no
Immunoblotting technique for the detection of allergens of Aspergillus fumigatus: influence of Nonidet P-40 on the sensitivity.,"Immunoblotting provides a useful technique for the study of antigens, antibodies and allergens. To overcome problems regarding the loss of antigenic properties during the blotting and developing procedures, several solutions have been described. The inclusion of Nonidet P-40, recommended to increase the sensitivity of developing procedures for immunoblots, in an existing procedure for the detection of allergens of Aspergillus fumigatus, however, led to decreased sensitivity of the method.",1999,10412684,no
Detection ofAspergillus Fumigatus based on Asp fl gene in clinical specimens.,"Oligonucleotide primers were synthesised based on the gene sequence of an 18 kDa allergen/antigen ofA. fumigatus isolated from a pathogenic strain. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out using the forward and reverse primers and genomic DNA ofA. fumigatus, A. flavus andA. niger as template. This resulted in a PCR product of 480 bp with onlyA. fumigatus. The absence of PCR product inA. flavus andA. niger with the primers of Asp fl facilitated use of these primers for detection ofA. fumigatus in clinical specimens of patients. The results were compared with microscopy, culture and serology. Application of PCR test to clinical samples of aspergillosis patients is discussed.",1999,23105210,no
[Does allergic fungal sinusitis exist? Preliminary results of a prospective study].,"Allergic aspergillar sinusitis is a very controversial clinical feature. We present results of a prospective study aimed at evaluating the reality of allergic aspergillar sinusitis in a nosologic and clinical point of vue. During a 5 months period, 31 patients underwent surgery: 21 sino-nasal polyposis, 5 chronic sinusitis without polyposis, 5 chronic sinusitis with radiologic images evocative of mycosis. The study was carried out using clinical criteria (per-operative discovery of glue-like, thickened and viscous aspect of the secretions), pathologic criteria (the presence of elements consitutive of allergic mucin), mycological criteria (direct examination and culture), and immunoallergic criteria (specific IgE for Aspergillus fumigatus, serology for Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus flavus (IgM, IgG), skin tests for Aspergillus fumigatus). In three cases we suspect an allergic aspergillar sinusitis (one patient presenting a bilateral chronic sinusitis and two patients presenting a sinonasal polyposis). In two patients presenting a sinonasal polyposis, a allergic fungal sinusitis was suspected, fungal identification was not possible.",1999,10378036,no
Binding of Asp-hemolysin from Aspergillus fumigatus to oxidized low density lipoprotein.,"Asp-hemolysin is a human low density lipoprotein (LDL) binding protein.

Health evaluation of free-ranging rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocomes) in Argentina.,"As part of annual colony counts in Santa Cruz Province, Argentina, a health survey of rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocomes) was conducted in 1994. Forty-five birds were examined during handling procedures, and blood and fecal samples were collected for laboratory analysis. All birds appeared to be in good condition. No ecto- or endoparasites were found. Hematology, plasma chemistry, and plasma mineral levels were measured and correlated with the results of bacterial and viral serology. Antibodies against Chlamydia sp., avian adenovirus, avian encephalomyelitis virus, infectious bronchitis virus, avian reovirus, and paramyxovirus-1, -2, and -3 were found. Mean plasma chemistry and mineral values differed between individuals testing positive and negative on serologic tests. There was no serologic evidence of exposure to avian influenza virus, duck viral enteritis, infectious bursal disease, infectious laryngotracheitis, Aspergillus sp., or Salmonella pullorum. Trace amounts of endrin were found in the plasma of one bird, but all other chlorinated pesticide and polychlorinated biphenyl levels were below detectable limits.",1999,10367640,no
Glucose 1- and 2-oxidases from fungal strains: isolation and production of monoclonal antibodies.,"Monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) against purified glucose 2-oxidase (EC 1.1.3.10) from Coriolus versicolor were raised by hybridoma technology using Sp2/0 myeloma cells as a fusion partner. Hybrid growth was observed in 42% of culture wells and 30% of these (i.e. 30 culture wells) contained anti-glucose 2-oxidase activity. Three positive wells containing hybrid cell lines were selected and cloned twice by the limiting dilution method and two hybridoma clones (E1A5 and E1A6) secreting Mabs were selected at random for purification and characterisation purposes. Both cell lines secreted Mabs of IgM class which were purified by gel filtration chromatography on a Sephacryl S-200 column with a final recovery of 80% and a purification factor of 16. The purified preparations were apparently homogeneous on native PAGE running with a M(r) of 950 kDa. Mabs were highly specific for glucose 2-oxidase as determined by Western blotting. These Mabs also crossreacted with glucose 1- and 2-oxidases from other fungal sources (Phanerochaeta chrysosporium, Penicillium amagasakiense and Aspergillus niger) as determined by Western blotting and by ELISA. Both glucose 1- and 2-oxidases from C. versicolor, P. chrysosporium, P. amagasakiense and A. niger were purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on Sepharose 4B-triazine dye with a recovery of enzyme activity in the range 85-92%. Purified preparations of glucose oxidases from fungal strains were apparently homogeneous on native PAGE. Glucose 2-oxidases were more hydrophobic than glucose 1-oxidases as determined by their chomatographic behaviour on Sepharose 4B-Cibacron Red G-E which could be used to study their roles in lignin biodegradation.",1999,10361723,no
Hilar adenopathy in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"A 20-year-old male student developed allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax done to detect central bronchiectasis (CB) for confirmation of diagnosis revealed, in addition, right hilar lymphadenopathy. Hilar adenopathy is thought to be rare in ABPA and has been documented only once before. Because of the finding of hilar adenopathy, the earlier reported patient had to undergo an invasive surgical procedure.To report a case of true hilar adenopathy in ABPA.This is a single case report. Contrast enhanced CT of the thorax was done. Serum precipitating antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus were tested using gel diffusion technique, and intradermal testing with antigens of Aspergillus species was performed. Specific IgG antibodies against A. fumigatus and total IgE levels were measured by ELISA.A review of serial chest radiographs over a period of 3 years demonstrated transient pulmonary infiltrates and right hilar prominence. Computed tomography of the thorax revealed right hilar lymphadenopathy along with bilateral central bronchiectasis and patchy infiltrates. Strong bands of precipitins were detected against A. fumigatus. Intradermal testing with antigens of Aspergillus species elicited strong type I (immediate) and type III (Arthus-type) hypersensitivity reactions to A. fumigatus and A. niger. Specific IgG antibodies against A. fumigatus was positive and total IgE level was significantly elevated. Peripheral blood eosinophilia was also detected.Although extremely rare, ABPA should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hilar adenopathy.",1999,10353584,no
Asterriquinones produced by Aspergillus candidus inhibit binding of the Grb-2 adapter to phosphorylated EGF receptor tyrosine kinase.,"Five new asterriquinone analogs (2-4, 6, 7), together with previously identified neoasterriquinone (1) and isoasterriquinone (5), were isolated from a fermentation broth of the fungus Aspergillus candidus and purified by HSCCC (high speed counter current chromatography) followed by HPLC. The structures were determined by 1D and 2D NMR and MS/MS techniques. All seven showed inhibitory activity against the binding of a recombinant protein containing the SH2 protein domain of Grb-2 to the tyrosine phosphorylated form of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Some of these asterriquinones exhibited specific inhibition of Grb-2 binding compared to Grb-7 and PLC-gamma.",1999,10348035,no
Specific IgG subclass antibody pattern to Aspergillus fumigatus in patients with cystic fibrosis with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA).,"IgG and IgG subclass antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus (A fumigatus) were measured in a large population of patients with cystic fibrosis to elucidate a putative antibody pattern specific for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA).An ELISA technique using water soluble somatic hyphal (WSSH) A fumigatus antigens and subclass specific monoclonal antibodies was used for cross sectional quantification of IgG and IgG1-4 subclass antibody levels in the serum of 238 patients with cystic fibrosis and 107 healthy controls.In patients with cystic fibrosis persistently colonised with A fumigatus the subclass antibody levels were significantly increased compared with patients with cystic fibrosis never or rarely colonised (p < 0.001). The group of patients persistently colonised with A fumigatus with ABPA (+Af+ABPA) had significantly increased levels of IgG antibodies to A fumigatus (Af-IgG) (median 69 ELISA units (EU) versus 31) and of subclasses Af-IgG1 (91 versus 27), Af-IgG2 (143 versus 56), and Af-IgG4 antibodies (72 versus 20), but not of IgG3 (17 versus 15), compared with the colonised patients without ABPA (+Af-ABPA). Patients with cystic fibrosis with no or only rare isolates of A fumigatus without ABPA (-Af-ABPA) also had significantly increased subclass antibody levels (Af-IgG1 9 versus 3, Af-IgG2 28 versus 5, Af-IgG4 16 versus 4 p < 0.001) compared with healthy controls. Low, although detectable, levels of antibodies were demonstrated in healthy controls. ABPA seemed to occur independently of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Using diagnostic cut off levels for ABPA, sensitivity and specificity were calculated. The highest specificity was found for IgG4 (88%)In a large number of unselected patients with cystic fibrosis significantly increased levels of Af-specific antibodies belonging to total IgG and all four subclasses were found in all groups of patients compared with healthy controls. In patients persistently colonised with A fumigatus these levels were significantly higher than in non-colonised patients, and the significantly highest levels (with the exception of IgG3) were found in patients with ABPA. Using a sensitive ELISA technique, measurements of IgG and IgG subclass antibodies to A fumigatus might be of importance in the management of ABPA, especially as a screening test to exclude the presence of ABPA other tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis.",1999,10343631,no
Dual roles of amniotic fluid nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2 in preterm labor with intra-amniotic infection.,"We hypothesized that induction of nitric oxide synthase and cyclo-oxygenase-2 by bacterial products in intra-amniotic infection could increase the production of proinflammatory nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and cause preterm labor. Thus, we sought to determine amniotic fluid levels of nitric oxide metabolites (NOx) and PGE2 in preterm labor patients with and without intra-amniotic infection. Amniotic fluid from 13 preterm labor patients with intra-amniotic infection and 24 without intra-amniotic infection were studied. Intra-amniotic infection was defined as the presence of a positive amniotic fluid culture. Amniotic fluid was tested for NOx, PGE2, glucose, leukocyte counts, Gram stains, creatinine, pH, and specific gravity. NOx was determined using Griess reagent after reduction of nitrate to nitrite with aspergillus nitrate reductase. PGE2 was measured by an enzyme-linked immunoassay. Both amniotic fluid NOx and PGE2 were normalized by amniotic fluid creatinine. We found that amniotic fluid concentrations of NOx and PGE2 were significantly higher in preterm labor patients with intra-amniotic infection compared to those without intraamniotic infection (NOx: median 1.8 micromol/mg creatinine, range 0.7 to 6.8 vs. 1.3 micromol/mg creatinine, range 0.9 to 2.1, p=0.03 PGE2: median 33.5 ng/mg creatinine, range 0.0 to 1048.6 vs. 0.0 ng/mg creatinine, range 0.0 to 33.6, p=0.004). In addition, amniotic fluid NOx and PGE2 were positively correlated (r=0.343, p=0.0398). We conclude that there may be an interaction between the nitric oxide and prostaglandin pathways in intraamniotic infection. Increased production of amniotic fluid pro-inflammatory nitric oxide and PGE2 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of preterm labor in patients with intra-amniotic infection.",1999,10333395,no
Characterization of allergens from Penicillium oxalicum and P. notatum by immunoblotting and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis.,"Penicillium species are important causative agents of extrinsic bronchial asthma. However, little is known about the allergens of these ubiquitous fungal species. Objective The object was to analyse the composition, the allergenic cross-reactivity and the N-terminal sequences of allergens from two prevalent airborne Penicillium species, P. oxalicum and P. notatum.The allergenic composition and the immunoglobulin (Ig)E cross-reactivity were analysed by immunoblot and immunoblot inhibition, respectively, using sera from asthmatic patients. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of major allergens were determined by Edman degradation. Allergens identified were also characterized by immunoblotting using monoclonal antibody (MoAb) PCM39 against the alkaline serine proteinase major allergen of P. citrinum.Among the 70 asthmatic sera tested, 18 (26%) and 17 (24%) had IgE immunoblot reactivity towards components of P. oxalicum and P. notatum, respectively. Major allergens (> 80% frequency of IgE-binding) from both species are the 34 and 30 kDa proteins of P. oxalicum and the 34 and 32 kDa proteins of P. notatum. IgE cross-reactivity among these major allergens and the 33 kDa major allergen of P. citrinum can be detected by immunoblot inhibition studies. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the 34 kDa allergen of P. oxalicum and of the 32 and the 28 kDa allergens of P. notatum share homology with sequences of the vacuolar serine proteinase from Aspergillus fumigatus. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 34 kDa allergen of P. notatum shows sequence homology with that of alkaline serine proteinase from P. citrinum. Results obtained from immunoblotting showed that MoAb PCM39 reacted with the 34, 30 and 16 kDa IgE-binding components of P. oxalicum, and with the 34, 32 and 28 kDa IgE-binding components of P. notatum.Results obtained suggest that the 34 kDa major allergen of P. oxalicum may be a vacuolar serine proteinase. The 34 and the 32 kDa major allergens of P. notatum may be the alkaline and the vacuolar serine proteinases of P. notatum, respectively. The 30 and 16 kDa IgE-binding components of P. oxalicum and the 28 kDa IgE-binding component of P. notatum may be breakdown products of the 34 and the 32 kDa major vacuolar serine proteinase allergens of P. oxalicum and P. notatum, respectively.",1999,10231324,no
"Production, characterization, and epitope mapping of a monoclonal antibody against aspartic proteinase of Candida albicans.","A monoclonal antibody (MAb MAb CAP1) that was reactive with extracellular aspartic proteinase of Candida albicans (CAP) was produced. The MAb showed strong sensitivity and reactivity to CAP but not to the aspartic proteinases of Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, and Aspergillus fumigatus or to human cathepsin D or porcine pepsin. The epitope of the CAP recognized by the MAb was the proteinaseous part of CAP and the putative epitope of the MAb was located in the Asp77 to Gly103 sequence. This antibody could be useful for the characterization of CAP and would be a valuable probe for the detection of CAP antigen in the sera of patients with invasive candidiasis.",1999,10225850,no
Expression of two major chitinase genes of Trichoderma atroviride (T. harzianum P1) is triggered by different regulatory signals.,"Regulation of the expression of the two major chitinase genes, ech42 (encoding the CHIT42 endochitinase) and nag1 (encoding the CHIT73 N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase), of the chitinolytic system of the mycoparasitic biocontrol fungus Trichoderma atroviride (= Trichoderma harzianum P1) was investigated by using a reporter system based on the Aspergillus niger glucose oxidase. Strains harboring fusions of the ech42 or nag1 5' upstream noncoding sequences with the A. niger goxA gene displayed a glucose oxidase activity pattern that was consistent under various conditions with expression of the native ech42 and nag1 genes, as assayed by Northern analysis. The expression product of goxA in the mutants was completely secreted into the medium, detectable on Western blots, and quantifiable by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. nag1 gene expression was triggered during growth on fungal (Botrytis cinerea) cell walls and on the chitin degradation product N-acetylglucosamine. N-Acetylglucosamine, di-N-acetylchitobiose, or tri-N-acetylchitotriose also induced nag1 gene expression when added to mycelia pregrown on different carbon sources. ech42 expression was also observed during growth on fungal cell walls but, in contrast, was not triggered by addition of chitooligomers to pregrown mycelia. Significant ech42 expression was observed after prolonged carbon starvation, independent of the use of glucose or glycerol as a carbon source, suggesting that relief of carbon catabolite repression was not involved in induction during starvation. In addition, ech42 gene transcription was triggered by physiological stress, such as low temperature, high osmotic pressure, or the addition of ethanol. Four copies of a putative stress response element (CCCCT) were found in the ech42 promoter.",1999,10223970,no
Neutropenic infections in 100 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease treated with high-dose BEAM chemotherapy and peripheral blood progenitor cell transplant: out-patient treatment is a viable option.,"A retrospective analysis was performed on 100 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL, n = 75) or Hodgkin's disease (HD, n = 25) who underwent peripheral blood progenitor cell transplant (PBPCT) following high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) with BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine and melphalan (BEAM) between March 1994 and June 1997. Following PBPCT and until engraftment all patients received oral ciprofloxacin and fluconazole, patients with positive Herpes simplex virus serology received acyclovir and 91 patients received filgrastim. The median days of neutropenia and days to an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >500/mm3 were 6 and 9, respectively. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 68 patients. Gram-positive bacteremia occurred in 14 patients. No gram-negative infections, invasive fungal infections, intensive care visits or deaths occurred during the period of neutropenia or in the first 30 days following transplant. In multivariate logistic regression the risk of development of any infection was associated only with the duration of neutropenia (P = 0.02) and the risk of bacteremia was associated only with the number of CD34+ cells infused (P = 0.046). Among 49 patients treated in the outpatient setting, 14 (28%) were never admitted. High-dose chemotherapy with BEAM supported by PBPCT, prophylactic antibiotics and filgrastim resulted in a low incidence of infections and no acute mortality.

"Nasosinus aspergillosis in Sudanese patients: clinical features, pathology, diagnosis, and treatment.","The objective of this study was a prospective analysis of the clinical features, pathology, diagnosis, and treatment of patients treated between 1993 and 1996 for nasosinus aspergillosis in the Sudan.Clinical examinations and laboratory tests for serologic, mycologic, and histologic analysis were conducted on all patients, as were radiologic and computerized tomographic studies when external swelling of any of the paranasal sinuses was evident.The age group 11 to 50 years were predominantly affected, with a peak in those aged 21 to 30 years. Females were affected more often than were males. The clinical features were mainly nasal polyposis, external swelling of the ethmoid sinus medial to the inner canthus, or maxillary cheek swelling and/or proptosis. In the paranasal sinuses, the ethmoids were the most frequently affected. Intracranial extension of the disease occurred in two patients. Serologic examinations and mycological cultures showed more incidence of positive results than did histopathology. Aspergillus flavus was grown in all the positive mycologic cultures except one, where Aspergillus niger was grown. The treatment was mainly surgical, supplemented by an antifungal drug (itraconazole). The incidence of recurrence was 9.3%, and it was noticed that the recurrence occurred in those patients who were not taking their medicines regularly.Nasosinus aspergillosis is a common disease in Sudan. Nasal polyposis is the commonest mode of clinical presentation. Serology and mycologic cultures are quite helpful in the diagnosis. Surgical and medical treatment are complementary of each other.",1999,10212875,no
Invasive aspergillosis caused by Aspergillus ustus: case report and review.,"A case of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in an allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipient caused by Aspergillus ustus is presented. A. ustus was also recovered from the hospital environment, which may indicate that the infection was nosocomially acquired. A literature review revealed seven cases of invasive infections caused by A. ustus, and three of these were primarily cutaneous infections. In vitro susceptibility testing of 12 A. ustus isolates showed that amphotericin B and terbinafine had fungicidal activity and that itraconazole and voriconazole had fungistatic activity.",1999,10203536,no
Optimization and stability of glucoamylase production by recombinant strains of Aspergillus niger in chemostat culture.,"When grown on a medium containing 5 g maltodextrin L-1, Aspergillus niger transformant N402[pAB6-10]B1, which has an additional 20 copies of the glucoamylase (glaA) gene, produced 320 +/- 8 mg (mean +/- S.E.) glucoamylase (GAM) L-1 in batch culture and 373 +/- 9 mg GAM L-1 in maltodextrin-limited chemostat culture at a dilution rate of 0.13 h-1. These values correspond to specific production rates (qp) of 5.6 and 16.0 mg GAM [g biomass]-1 h-1, respectively. In maltodextrin-limited chemostat cultures grown at dilution rates from 0.06 to 0.14 h-1, GAM was produced by B1 in a growth-correlated manner, demonstrating that a continuous flow culture system operated at a high dilution rate is an efficient way of producing this enzyme. In chemostat cultures grown at high dilution rates, GAM production in chemostat cultures was repressed when the limiting nutrient was fructose or xylose, but derepressed when the limiting nutrient was glucose (qp, 12.0), potassium (6.2), ammonium (4.1), phosphate (2.0), magnesium (1.5) or sulphate (0.9). For chemostat cultures grown at a dilution rate of 0.13 h-1, the addition of 5 g mycopeptone L-1 to a glucose-mineral salts medium resulted in a 64% increase in GAM concentration (from 303 +/- 12 to 496 +/- 10 mg GAM L-1) and a 37% increase in specific production rate (from 12.0 +/- 0.4 to 16.4 +/- 1.6 mg GAM [g biomass]-1 h-1). However, although recombinant protein production was stable for at least 948 h (191 generations) when A. niger B1 was grown in chemostat culture on glucose-mineral salts medium, it was stable for less than 136 h (27 generations) on medium containing mycopeptone. The predominant morphological mutants occurring after prolonged chemostat culture were shown to have selective advantage in the chemostat over the parental strain. Compared to their parental strains, two morphological mutants had similar GAM production levels, while a third had a reduced production level. Growth tests and molecular analysis revealed that the number of glaA gene copies in this latter strain (B1-M) was reduced, which could explain its reduced GAM production. Shake-flask cultures carried out with the various morphological mutants revealed that in batch culture all three strains produced considerably less GAM than their parent strains and even less than N402. We show that physiological changes in these morphological mutants contribute to this decreased level of GAM production.",1999,10099354,no
Secondary metabolites of Aspergillus exert immunobiological effects on human monocytes.,"This project focused on the effects of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), a food-contaminating mycotoxin produced by fungi, genus Aspergillus, on the release and genetic expression of some important cytokines, i.e., (interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha)) by human monocytes. Monocytes, preincubated for different time periods with concentrations of AFB1 ranging from 0.01 to 1.0 pg/mL, were then activated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Cytokine levels were measured by immunoassay and mRNA by cDNA amplification. Pretreatment of monocytes with AFB1 resulted in a decrease in IL-1, IL-6 and TNF alpha release already at a concentration of 0.05 pg/mL. The gene expression of the cytokines considered was drastically affected by treatment with AFB1. In fact, AFB1 completely blocked the transcription of IL-1 alpha, IL-6 and TNF alpha mRNAs, while it did not affect beta-actin mRNA at the concentrations used. It therefore appears that AFB1 exerts its effect on cytokine release through selective inhibition of specific mRNA, without affecting general protein synthesis.",1999,10096130,no
Comparison of kinetic properties of amine oxidases from sainfoin and lentil and immunochemical characterization of copper/quinoprotein amine oxidases.,"Kinetic properties of novel amine oxidase isolated from sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia) were compared to those of typical plant amine oxidase (EC 1.4.3.6) from lentil (Lens culinaris). The amine oxidase from sainfoin was active toward substrates, such as 1,5-diaminopentane (cadaverine) with K(m) of 0.09 mM and 1,4-diaminobutane (putrescine) with K(m) of 0.24 mM. The maximum rate of oxidation for cadaverine at saturating concentration was 2.7 fold higher than that of putrescine. The amine oxidase from lentil had the maximum rate for putrescine comparable to the rate of sainfoin amine oxidase with the same substrate. Both amine oxidases, like other plant Cu-amine oxidases, were inhibited by substrate analogs (1,5-diamino-3-pentanone, 1,4-diamino-2-butanone and aminoguanidine), Cu2+ chelating agents (diethyltriamine, 1,10-phenanthroline, 8-hydroxyquinoline, 2,2'-bipyridyl, imidazole, sodium cyanide and sodium azide), some alkaloids (L-lobeline and cinchonine), some lathyrogens (beta-aminopropionitrile and aminoacetonitrile) and other inhibitors (benzamide oxime, acetone oxime, hydroxylamine and pargyline). Tested by Ouchterlony's double diffusion in agarose gel, polyclonal antibodies against the amine oxidase from sainfoin, pea and grass pea cross-reacted with amine oxidases from several other Fabaceae and from barley (Hordeum vulgare) of Poaceae, while amine oxidase from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger did not cross-react at all. However, using Western blotting after SDS-PAGE with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the amine oxidase from Aspergillus niger, some degree of similarity of plant amine oxidases from sainfoin, pea, field pea, grass pea, fenugreek, common melilot, white sweetclover and Vicia panonica with the A. niger amine oxidase was confirmed.",1999,10092944,no
Increased antigen-specific Th-2 response in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in patients with cystic fibrosis.,"The majority of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) become colonized with Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) in the lower respiratory tract, the prevalence being up to 60%. Between 1-11% of CF patients develop allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). Previous studies of ABPA in selected patients suffering from cystic fibrosis or atopic asthma have suggested a pathogenic role for antigen-specific ""Th2-like"" T lymphocytes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quantitative importance of such Th2 cells, using improved techniques for measuring interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-5 secretion in unseparated peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) suspensions from CF patients with ABPA and from a control group without ABPA. Thus, 20 patients with CF, heavily colonized with A. fumigatus in the lower respiratory tract, were studied: 10 patients with ABPA, and 10 without. Unseparated PBMC were stimulated in vitro by A. fumigatus antigen and by an unrelated antigen (tetanus toxoid) as a control. After 6 days of stimulation, IL-4 and IL-5 (markers for Th2 cell activity) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) (marker for Th1 cell activity) were quantified in the supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. PBMC from ABPA patients secreted significantly higher amounts of IL-4, i.e., 0.48 (0.15-0.8) ng/mL (median (range)), and IL-5, 37.64 (0.32-82.85) ng/mL, compared to secretions obtained in non-ABPA CF controls of 0.07 (0.04-0.16) ng/mL and 3.00 (0.10-5.09) ng/mL, respectively (P < 0.01 for both). IFN-gamma secretion was similar in the two groups, amounting to 21.5 (2.05-72.5) ng/mL in ABPA patients vs. 20.75 (1.80-54.0) ng/mL in non-ABPA patients (P = 0.47). No significant differences were obtained in the cytokine secretion induced by tetanus toxoid stimulation between the two groups. We conclude that ABPA in CF patients is associated with an antigen-specific, Th2-like T-cell immune response, as indicated by excessive secretion of IL-4 and IL-5.",1999,10088929,no
Role of glycosylation in the functional expression of an Aspergillus niger phytase (phyA) in Pichia pastoris.,"Economical and thermostable phytase enzymes are needed to release phytate-phosphorus in plant foods for human and animal nutrition and to reduce phosphorus pollution of animal waste. Our objectives were to determine if a methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, was able to express a phytase gene (phyA) from Aspergillus niger efficiently and if suppression of glycosylation by tunicamycin affected its functional expression. The gene (1.4 kb) was inserted into an expression vector pPICZalphaA with a signal peptide alpha-factor, under the control of AOX1 promoter. The resulting plasmid was transformed into two P. pastoris strains: KM71 (methanol utilization slow) and X33 (wild-type). Both host strains produced high levels of active phytase (25-65 units/ml of medium) that were largely secreted into the medium. The expressed enzyme was cross-reacted with the polyclonal antibody raised against the wild-type enzyme and showed two pH optima, 2.5 and 5.5, and an optimal temperature at 60 degrees C. Compared with the phyA phytase overexpressed by A. niger, this phytase had identical capacity in hydrolyzing phytate-phosphorus from soybean meal and slightly better thermostability. Deglycosylation of the secreted phytase resulted in reduction in the size from 95 to 55 kDa and in thermostability by 34%. Tunicamycin (20 microg/ml of medium) resulted in significant reductions of both intracellular and extracellular phytase activity expression. Because there was no accumulation of intracellular phytase protein, the impairment did not seem to occur at the level of translocation of phytase. In conclusion, glycosylation was vital to the biosynthesis of the phyA phytase in P. pastoris and the thermostability of the expressed enzyme.",1999,10087168,no
Probable false positive coccidioidal serologic results in patients with cystic fibrosis.,"Coccidioidomycosis is an acquired fungal infection that afflicts primarily the respiratory tract. Cystic fibrosis patients who are being treated with glucocorticoids and immunosuppressed organ recipients may be at risk for infection with Coccidiodes immitis or reactivation of latent infection. The diagnosis is best made by demonstration of the organism in pathologic specimens or by culture. Serologic screening is another method that is reliable in most patients. We studied 98 patients who had serologic screening for Coccidiodes immitis performed as part of their evaluation for lung transplantation. This study revealed that approximately 15% of the cystic fibrosis patients screened had putative coccidioidal IgM, in the absence of an IgG response. None of the patients studied had a positive fungal culture for the organism. None of the non-cystic fibrosis patients screened had detectable coccidioidal IgG or IgM. We hypothesize that cystic fibrosis patients may have hyperimmune sera which interferes with serologic screening tests. We would recommend repeat serologic testing and attempts to identify the organism in tissue or by culture to confirm the diagnosis in these patients.",1999,10084736,no
Aspergillus fumigatus catalases: cloning of an Aspergillus nidulans catalase B homologue and evidence for at least three catalases.,"The presence of catalases in the water soluble fractions of three Aspergillus fumigatus strains was investigated using non-denaturing and denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western analysis. Using non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining for catalase activity, three separate catalases were identified. An A. fumigatus catalase gene (catB) was cloned from genomic DNA using the Aspergillus niger catR gene as a probe. Polyclonal antibodies were raised to a glutathione S-transferase-CatB fusion product expressed in Escherichia coli. Western analysis indicated that, under denaturing conditions, the polyclonal antibody recognised a 90-kDa band and under non-denaturing conditions, two separate bands were identified. These results indicate that A. fumigatus in addition to CatB, produces at least two other catalases, one of which is similar in size to CatB. The polyclonal antibody was also used to observe catalase expression in mice, experimentally infected with A. fumigatus. Staining was observed heterogeneously throughout the fungal hyphae. This result indicates that catalase is produced by A. fumigatus during invasive aspergillosis.",1999,10076909,no
Analysis of peptidogalactomannans from the mycelial surface of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Peptidogalactomannans (pGMs) from mycelium of two strains of Aspergillus fumigatus were fractionated by Cetavlon precipitation and size exclusion chromatography and their carbohydrate structures analysed using methylation-fragmentation analysis, partial acetolysis and 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The most significant difference between the pGMs of the two strains was the degree of branching and the proportion of non-reducing ends of alpha-D-Manp and beta-D-Galf units. Methylation data showed that the pGM from AF 2109 contained alpha-D-Manp and beta-D-Galf non-reducing end units in a proportion of 3:1 while, in contrast, the proportion of these structures in pGM from AF 2140 was 7:1, resulting in a highly branched structure. The immunoreactivity of the pGM fractions was tested by indirect immunofluorescence. The fractions were also tested in an ELISA system with rabbit antiserum raised to whole cells of A. fumigatus NCPF 2140 and with serum from patients with either proven aspergilloma or ABPA. The carbohydrate moiety of the pGM appears to be responsible for the antigenicity. Periodate treatment, partial acid hydrolysis and beta-elimination removed most of the antibody binding capacity.",1999,10075501,no
Detection of PCR-amplified fungal DNA by using a PCR-ELISA system.,"In order to speed up and standardize polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection of medically important fungi in clinical samples we established a combination of commercially available kits for DNA extraction, PCR amplification and detection of the amplicons. The PCR plate assay proved to be as sensitive and specific as our previously published assay (5 cfu ml(-1) blood). Moreover, in a selected group of patients, all patients with proven and probable invasive fungal infection were found to be PCR-positive. Thus the PCR plate assay was found to be a sensitive, technically simplified and standardized method with potential for adaptation to automation.",1999,10075496,no
Production of specific monoclonal antibodies to Aspergillus species and their use in immunohistochemical identification of aspergillosis.,"Two anti-Aspergillus murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), designated 164G and 611F, have been produced both specifically recognize cytoplasmic antigens of A. fumigatus, A. flavus, and A. niger by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Aspergillus meningitis: diagnosis by non-culture-based microbiological methods and management.,"The performance of antibody detection, antigen detection, and Aspergillus genus-specific PCR for diagnosing Aspergillus meningitis was investigated with 26 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples obtained from a single patient with proven infection caused by Aspergillus fumigatus. Immunoglobulin G antibodies directed against Aspergillus were not detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in CSF or serum. The antigen galactomannan was detected in the CSF 45 days before a culture became positive, and Aspergillus DNA was detected 4 days prior to culture. Decline of the galactomannan antigen titer in the CSF during treatment with intravenous and intraventricular amphotericin B and intravenous voriconazole corresponded with the clinical response to treatment.",1999,10074549,no
"Fungal extracellular polysaccharides in house dust as a marker for exposure to fungi: relations with culturable fungi, reported home dampness, and respiratory symptoms.","Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated an association between indoor fungal growth and respiratory symptoms. However, in only a few studies was fungal exposure actually measured.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the measurement by enzyme immunoassay of extracellular polysaccharides of Aspergillus and Penicillium species (EPS-Asp/Pen ) in house dust as a marker for fungal exposure and to study the relations between EPS-Asp/Pen levels and home dampness and respiratory symptoms in children.Extracts of house dust samples from bedroom and living room floors and mattresses from homes of 31 children with chronic respiratory symptoms and 29 children with no chronic respiratory symptoms were analyzed for EPS-Asp/Pen.EPS-Asp/Pen were readily detectable (40 to 46,513 nanogram equivalent/g dust) in 161 house dust extracts, with highest concentrations in living room floor dust. EPS-Asp/Pen levels were 2 to 3 times higher on carpeted floors than on smooth floors. EPS-Asp/Pen were significantly correlated with total culturable fungi (r = 0.3 to 0.5) and with house dust mite allergens (r = 0.3 to 0.5). EPS-Asp/Pen levels in living room floor dust were positively associated with occupant-reported home dampness. This was not observed for EPS-Asp/Pen in bedroom floor and mattress dust. EPS-Asp/Pen levels in living room floor dust were positively associated with respiratory symptoms. EPS-Asp/Pen in bedroom floor and mattress dust showed a reversed association with respiratory symptoms, possibly because of allergen-avoidance measures taken in the bedroom.The enzyme immunoassay for fungal EPS-Asp/Pen may be a useful method for exposure assessment of indoor fungi.",1999,10069885,no
Bronchoscopic and serologic diagnosis of Aspergillus fumigatus pulmonary infection in a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus).,"A 4-yr-old male bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) developed an Aspergillus fumigatus pneumonia. Fungal elements were identified by cytology and microbiology from endoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage and brushings of a raised yellow endobronchial lesion. The results of qualitative immunodiffusion serology, a technique that identifies specific circulating antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus, were suggestive of an active infection. The dolphin was treated with itraconazole for over 2 yr, which resulted in remission of clinical signs. Pneumonia caused by Aspergillus sp. accounts for the large majority of pulmonary mycoses in marine mammals. Bronchoscopy facilitated an early definitive diagnosis, accurate treatment, and remission.",1999,10065855,no
Thaumatin production in Aspergillus awamori by use of expression cassettes with strong fungal promoters and high gene dosage.,"Four expression cassettes containing strong fungal promoters, a signal sequence for protein translocation, a KEX protease cleavage site, and a synthetic gene (tha) encoding the sweet protein thaumatin II were used to overexpress this protein in Aspergillus awamori lpr66, a PepA protease-deficient strain. The best expression results were obtained with the gdhA promoter of A. awamori or with the gpdA promoter of Aspergillus nidulans. There was good correlation of tha gene dosage, transcript levels, and thaumatin secretion. The thaumatin gene was expressed as a transcript of the expected size in each construction (1.9 or 1.4 kb), and the transcript levels and thaumatin production rate decayed at the end of the growth phase, except in the double transformant TB2b1-44-GD5, in which secretion of thaumatin continued until 96 h. The recombinant thaumatin secreted by a high-production transformant was purified to homogeneity, giving one major component and two minor components. In all cases, cleavage of the fused protein occurred at the KEX recognition sequence. This work provides new expression systems in A. awamori that result in very high levels of thaumatin production.",1999,10049878,no
[The causes of death of pulmonary tuberculosis: late sequelae of pulmonary tuberculosis].,"We investigated the causes of death of late sequelae of pulmonary tuberculosis. Chronic respiratory failure is one of the most frequent cause of death in the patients of late sequelae of pulmonary tuberculosis. We compared the long term prognosis of chronic respiratory failure in case of emphysema and pulmonary tuberculosis. In the patients with chronic respiratory failure by pulmonary emphysema, the prognosis was poor in those with pulmonary hypertension. But in case of late sequelae of pulmonary tuberculosis, prognosis was not affected by presence or absence of pulmonary hypertension. The determinants of prognosis of late sequelae of pulmonary tuberculosis are the indication of home oxygen therapy, malnutrition, and hypoxemia. Fungal infection, especially aspergilloma, is a common secondary infection of late sequelae of pulmonary tuberculosis. We investigated forty-two cases of aspergilloma as late sequelae of pulmonary tuberculosis, and of those 15 patients died. The causes of death were pneumonia and respiratory failure. Measurement of galactomannan antigen of aspergillus in serum using ELISA or PCR, it was apparent that the outcome was poor in the patients positive for antigen. It suggested that the prognosis of the patients with aspergilloma related with some degree of invasion of Aspergillus in parenchyma. It was reported that neoplasm is closely related to chronic tuberculous empyema. Lymphoma is most frequently complicated with chronic tuberculous empyema, and squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, sarcoma and carcinoid were reported as complication of chronic empyema. We reported the case of angiosarcoma, originated from chronic empyema in left thoracic cavity formed after being treated for tuberculosis with artificial pneumothorax. Recently, the number of patients with late sequelae of pulmonary tuberculosis have been decreased, but some severe cases of patients of pulmonary tuberculosis will suffer from late sequelae of pulmonary tuberculosis, and that is still a great problem of the clinical course of pulmonary tuberculosis.",1999,10028811,no
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in cystic fibrosis: role of atopy and response to itraconazole.,"(1) To determine the relationship between IgE levels and the prevalence of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, (2) to establish the usefulness of assessing atopy as an identifying risk factor for ABPA, (3) to evaluate the clinical course of patients receiving and not receiving itraconazole as reflected in oral steroid dose requirements and number of acute episodes of ABPA, and (4) to determine the role of acute episodes of ABPA in pulmonary exacerbations of CF.Retrospective review of online clinical database and medical records.CF clinic and inpatient services of Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford.One hundred seventy-two patients with CF for whom serial serum total IgE levels were measured over a 5-year study period, 1992 to 1996.We reviewed records of patients followed up at the CF Center at Stanford who had serum total IgE measured between January 1, 1992, and December 31, 1996. Total IgE and Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) specific IgE antibodies were measured by commercial fluorometric solid-phase immunoassay. Precipitating antibodies to Af were measured by double immunodiffusion. Patients who were diagnosed as having ABPA were treated with itraconazole unless significant liver dysfunction was present. Oral steroid dosing requirements and acute episodes of ABPA for days with vs days without itraconazole were compared.Serum total IgE was elevated (> 1 SD > geometric mean for age) in 51% of patients tested. IgE > 500 IU/mL, chosen as a screening cutoff for evaluating possible ABPA, was present in 19% of patients at some time during the study period. Atopy (defined as > or = 1 IU/mL IgE antibody to > or = 1 allergen) was present in 61% of 104 patients tested for specific allergen sensitization. ABPA was diagnosed in 16 patients (9%). ABPA occurred in 22% of atopic CF patients but only in 2% of nonatopic patients (p = 0.001). Six percent of pulmonary exacerbations requiring hospitalization were associated with acute episodes of ABPA. Over the study period, itraconazole use was associated with a reduced average daily oral steroid dose of 47% (p = 0.05) and a reduction in the number of acute ABPA episodes by 55% (p < 0.001).Screening for atopy may be a cost-effective way to select CF patients for periodic monitoring with total serum IgE levels, since there is an increased risk of ABPA developing in atopic CF patients. Itraconazole treatment of ABPA is safe and associated with fewer acute episodes of ABPA despite reduction in average daily oral steroid dose.",1999,10027433,no
Molecular diagnosis and epidemiology of fungal infections.,"A variety of methods are utilized for DNA strain subtyping of Candida spp. because no 'gold standard' exists. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) or restriction enzyme analysis (REA) are useful to determine the source of an outbreak, but more reproducible and discriminatory methods such as Southern hybridization and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) may be required. When applied to some nosocomial Candida infections, multiple strains and species have been identified. Microevolution of yeast species occurs and epidemiologically related isolates may show minor pattern differences, creating uncertainty as to whether they are distinct strains. Approximately 1000 isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus from environmental and clinical sources were typed by REA probed with an A. fumigatus-specific retrotransposon-like sequence. Patients with no symptom of aspergillosis may carry several strains, whereas patients with pulmonary aspergillosis may carry one or two strains nocosomial transmission of aspergillosis was proven in 39% of the patients studied",1999,9988514,no

Detection of the 70-kilodalton histoplasma capsulatum antigen in serum of histoplasmosis patients: correlation between antigenemia and therapy during follow-up.,"Histoplasmosis is an important systemic fungal infection, particularly among immunocompromised individuals, who may develop a progressive disseminated form which is often fatal if it is untreated. In such patients, the detection of antibody responses for both diagnosis and follow-up may be of limited use, whereas the detection of Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum antigens may provide a more practical approach. We have recently described an inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection in patients' sera of a 69- to 70-kDa H. capsulatum var. capsulatum-specific antigen which appears to be useful in diagnosis. To investigate its potential for the follow-up of histoplasmosis patients during treatment, antigen titers in the sera of 16 patients presenting with different clinical forms of histoplasmosis were monitored at regular intervals for up to 80 weeks. Sera from four of five patients with the acute form of the disease showed rapid falls in antigenemia, becoming antigen negative by week 14 (range, weeks 10 to 16). Sera from four patients with disseminated histoplasmosis showed falls in antigen levels three of them became antigen negative by week 32",1999,9986830,no
Localization of a phosphatidylglycerol/phosphatidylinositol transfer protein in Aspergillus oryzae.,"The subcellular localization of the phosphatidylglycerol/phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PG/PI-TP) of Aspergillus oryzae was investigated using Western blot analysis of the cell protein extracts, a cellular membrane fractionation technique, and transmission electron microscopy. The PG/PI-TP, as detected by Western blot analysis with a specific immune serum, was found to be mainly cytoplasmic and partly associated with intracellular membranes. A fractionation experiment was conducted after homogenization of the filamentous fungus mycelium. The endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi-like vesicles, and the plasma membrane were separated by isopycnic ultracentrifugation on a sucrose gradient, and our data revealed that the immunodetected PG/PI-TP was only associated with the Golgi-like apparatus. All these results were documented by electron microscopy and indicate here for the first time that there exists a specific phospholipid transfer protein in a filamentous fungus that is localized in the cytoplasm and associated with Golgi-like vesicles.",1999,9933913,no
PCR-ELISA for the early diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillus infection in neutropenic patients.,"To evaluate a newly developed aspergillus mitochondrial gene PCR-ELISA assay for the early diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in neutropenic patients.The aspergillus mitochondrial gene was chosen for the amplification target for use with a solution hybridisation assay with colorimetric end stage detection in microtitre plate format (PCR-ELISA). The study group comprised neutropenic patients undergoing febrile episodes not responding to standard antibacterial antibiotics. Patients underwent computed tomography and bronchoscopy. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids were examined by culture and PCR.The aspergillus mitochondrial gene PCR-ELISA was both sensitive (100%) and specific (100%) for IPA in neutropenic patients. All 12 patients with definite or probable IPA had PCR positive BAL fluids. None of the patients with undiagnosed or confirmed infections of other aetiologies were mitochondrial PCR positive. Speciation based upon amplicon size difference was possible.Aspergillus mitochondrial DNA PCR-ELISA on BAL fluid is useful in the early diagnosis of IPA in neutropenic patients alone or, potentially, as an indication for thoracic computed tomography.",1999,9930067,no
False-positive results in premature infants with the Platelia Aspergillus sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.,"The sensitivity of a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting Aspergillus galactomannan was tested using 783 serum samples obtained from 247 patients (1-15 sera per patient) with severe underlying diseases (haematological malignancies or intensive care unit stay). We selected 146 serum samples from 50 patients for retesting. Serum samples were frozen after routine testing at -18 degrees C until retesting. All patients charts were checked for signs of Aspergillus infection, such as pneumonia or sinusitis. Adult patients were divided into four groups: proven (5), probable (6), suspected (8) or unlikely (25) Aspergillus infection. The results of Platelia ELISA were 100% in proven, 33% in probable and 50% in suspected Aspergillus infection. Patients with unlikely infection had no positive results with Platelia ELISA. Group 5 consists of six paediatric patients with prolonged ICU stay and a birth weight of 400-1320 g. In five out of six infants we found positive results with Platelia ELISA. All positive results in this group of patients are considered as false positive (83.3%).",1999,9916459,no
Immunohistochemical study of type I collagen turn-over and of matrix metalloproteinases in chromoblastomycosis before and after treatment by terbinafine.,"The distribution of type I collagen, the major component of human dermis, was characterized by immunohistochemistry in skin lesions of chromoblastomycosis, a chronic cutaneous mycosis, before and after a specific antifungal treatment with terbinafine to study the changes induced in the lesions by the treatment. Newly synthesized type I collagen was studied with an antibody directed against the aminoterminal propeptide of the molecule (PINP), whereas mature, cross-linked type I collagen was detected with an antibody against the carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP). The isopeptide N epsilon gamma-glutamyl lysine (N epsilon gamma GL), synthesized by transglutaminase and able to cross-link several components of the extracellular matrix, has also been investigated with two monoclonal antibodies to determine if it is involved in the stabilisation of the fibrotic cutaneous lesions. The degradative process involved in the remodelling has also been assessed by immunohistochemistry with anti-metalloproteinase (MMP-1 and MMP-9) and anti-tissue inhibitor (TIMP-1) antibodies. All tissue macrophages stained for CD68 and MMP-9, but not for MMP-1, while the polymorphonuclear neutrophils had an elastase and a weak MMP-9 phenotype. The fibroblasts of fibrotic areas stained constantly for N epsilon gamma GL and PINP. The immunostaining of extracellular matrix for ICTP and N epsilon gamma GL, and the number of PINP-positive fibroblasts, decreased significantly after one year of antifungal treatment. Terbinafine treatment decreases the synthesis of type I collagen and leads to a partial reversal of the cutaneous fibrotic lesions, independently of the cure of the fungal infection.",1999,9894250,no
Studies on pulmonary and systemic Aspergillus fumigatus-specific IgE and IgG antibodies in horses affected with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).,"Inhalant exposure to Aspergillus fumigatus (Asp. f.) antigens induces marked inflammatory and immunological alterations in the lungs of horses affected with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this study we investigated the role of specific allergen(s) present in Asp. f. on systemic and pulmonary IgE and IgG responses in control and COPD-affected horses, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblotting techniques. Compared with controls, horses affected with COPD had significantly higher levels of BALF IgE and IgG to somatic Asp. f. antigens as well as to the allergen 1/a (Asp. f. 1/a). Serum levels of IgE and IgG against these antigens did not differ between control and COPD-affected horses. Antigen specific IgE and IgG levels did not correlate between BALF and serum. Scanning of Asp. f. and IgE and IgG blots revealed bands that are recognised by both IgE- and IgG-specific antibodies. Additionally, all horses responded with BALF IgE- and IgG-specific for 93, 35, 31 and 23 kDa allergens, suggesting that these antigens are involved in the induction of airway IgE and IgG responses. These allergens may have the potential to be used as biomarkers for the diagnosis of Asp. f. related exacerbations of equine COPD.",1999,9880102,no
Carob pod: a new substrate for citric acid production by Aspergillus niger.,"The production of citric acid from carob pod extract by A. niger in surface fermentation was investigated. A maximum citric acid concentration (85.5 g/L), citric acid productivity (4.07 g/L/d), specific citric acid production rate (0.18 g/g/d), and specific sugar uptake rate (0.358 g/g/d) was achieved at an initial sugar concentration of 200 g/L, pH of 6.5, and a temperature of 30 degrees C. Other kinetic parameters, namely, citric acid yield, biomass yield, specific biomass production rate, and fermentation efficiency were maximum at pH 6.5, temperature 30 degrees C, and initial sugar concentration 100 g/L. The external addition of methanol into the carob pod extract at a concentration up to 4% (v/v) improved the production of citric acid.",1998,9854802,no
Comparison between PCR and detection of antigen in sera for diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis.,"We evaluated the usefulness of PCR and antigen detection for the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis. Forty-four serum samples from patients with pulmonary aspergillosis (33 with pulmonary aspergilloma, 4 with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, 4 with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, and 3 with aspergillus pyothorax) were used in this study. PCR detection of Aspergillus DNA in serum samples was successful in 39 patients. Galactomannan antigen was detected by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 25 patients and by latex agglutination test in 13 patients. Detection of Aspergillus DNA in serum samples by nested PCR had the highest sensitivity of the three methods tested for the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis.",1998,9854096,no
Isolated bilateral renal aspergillosis: an unusual presentation in an immunocompetent host.,A 35 year old apparently immunocompetent farmer developed isolated bilateral renal aspergillosis. He presented with acute renal failure due to granulomatous interstitial nephritis and had bilateral renal abscesses on CT scan. Diagnosis came from renal histology and was confirmed on serology.

"Analysis of the role of the gene bipA, encoding the major endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein in the secretion of homologous and heterologous proteins in black Aspergilli.","The function of the endoplasmic-reticulum-localized chaperone binding protein (BiP) in relation to protein secretion in filamentous fungi was studied. It was shown that the overproduction of several homologous and heterologous recombinant proteins by Aspergillus strains induces the expression of bipA, the BiP-encoding gene from Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus awamori. As this result could imply that BiP plays a role in protein overproduction, the effect of modulation of bipA gene expression on protein secretion was studied in several recombinant strains expressing glucoamylase (glaA) fusion genes. For overproduction of BiPA in these strains, extra copies of the bipA gene under the control of an inducible promoter were introduced. To allow analysis of the effect of a decreased bipA expression level on protein secretion, replacement of the wild-type gene for a bipA gene driven by the glaA promoter was attempted. However, this endeavour failed because of the lethality of this replacement. Although the final amount of secreted recombinant protein did not change significantly in strains with increased BiPA levels, increased levels of unprocessed fusion protein were detected in the total protein extracts of these strains.",1998,9830095,no
Effects of mutations in the starch-binding domain of Bacillus macerans cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase.,"Cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase) is an industrially important enzyme that produces cyclodextrins (CD) from starch by intramolecular transglycosylation. CGTase consists of five globular domains labeled A through E. To better understand the role of domain E in CGTase catalysis, we have constructed several mutants of Bacillus macerans CGTase. Removing the entire E domain resulted in an inactive enzyme. Adding six amino acids between domains D and E caused a decrease in activity and thermostability. Replacing domain E with the similar starch-binding domain from Aspergillus awamori glucoamylase I caused a drastic decrease in activity, indicating the necessity of correct alignment of bound substrate. Substituting tyrosine residue 634 (Tyr634) with phenylalanine had very little effect on activity or thermostability. Substituting Tyr634 with glycine resulted in a 25% increase of specific cyclization and starch-hydrolyzing activities compared with that of the wild-type enzyme. The latter mutant was less thermostable. The results of this study indicate that domain E is important for the stability and integrity of B. macerans CGTase.",1998,9828462,no
Characterization of antigenic epitopes in anti-ulcer pectic polysaccharides from Bupleurum falcatum L. using several carbohydrases.,"A polyclonal antibody (anti-bupleuran 2IIc/PG-1-IgG) against the ""ramified"" region (PG-1) of an anti-ulcer pectic polysaccharide was prepared and its antigenic epitopes were analyzed by using several carbohydrases. Enzymatic removal of arabinosyl residues from PG-1 by endo-(1-->5)-alpha-L-arabinanase (from Aspergillus niger) did not reduce the binding ability of anti-bupleuran 2IIc/PG-1-IgG to PG-1. When the endo-(1-->5)-alpha-L-arabinanase-resistant fraction (EA-1) was digested with rhamnogalacturonase A (rRGase A from A. aculeatus), a high-molecular-mass fragment fraction (RA-1) and an oligosaccharide fraction (RA-3) were obtained. RA-3 contained at least four kinds of oligosaccharides liberated from the rhamnogalacturonan core. This partial removal of the rhamnogalacturonan core in EA-1 also did not reduce the binding of the antibody to the polysaccharide. Further digestion of RA-1 with exo-(1-->3)-beta-D-galactanase (from Irpex lacteus), gave a high-molecular-mass fragment (EXG-1) and a trace of oligosaccharides (EXG-3). Methylation and FABMS analyses indicated that EXG-3 contained mono- and di-galactosyl oligosaccharides possessing terminal GlcA or GlcA4Me. Removal of the EXG-3 fraction from RA-1 by exo-(1-->3)-beta-D-galactanase significantly reduced the ability of the binding of the antibody to the polysaccharide. When PG-1 was digested with endo-(1-->6)-beta-D-galactanase (from Trichoderma viride) or beta-D-glucuronidase (from A. niger), the reactivities of both enzyme-resistant fractions to the antibody were decreased in comparison with that of PG-1. Both radish arabinogalactan (containing GlcA4Me) and beta-D-GlcpA-(1-->6)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->6)-D-Galp were shown to inhibit the reactivity of PG-1 to the antibody by competitive ELISA. These results suggest that 6-linked galactosyl chains containing terminal GlcA or GlcA4Me attached to (1-->3)-beta-D-galactosyl chains, are important sugar residues in the antigenic epitopes of the ""ramified"" region of bupleuran 2IIc.",1998,9825524,no
Characterization of Aspergillus nidulans peroxisomes by immunoelectron microscopy.,"In previous work, we have demonstrated that oleate induces a massive proliferation of microbodies (peroxisomes) in Aspergillus nidulans. Although at a lower level, proliferation of peroxisomes also occurs in cells growing under conditions that induce penicillin biosynthesis. Here, microbodies in oleate-grown A. nidulans cells were characterized by using several antibodies that recognize peroxisomal enzymes and peroxins in a broad spectrum of eukaryotic organisms such as yeast, and plant, and mammalian cells. Peroxisomes were immunolabeled by anti-SKL and anti-thiolase antibodies, which suggests that A. nidulans conserves both PTS1 and PTS2 import mechanisms. Isocitrate lyase and malate synthase, the two key enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle, were also localized in these organelles. In contrast to reports of Neurospora crassa, our results demonstrate that A. nidulans contains only one type of microbody (peroxisomes) that carry out the glyoxylate cycle and contain 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase and proteins with the C-terminal SKL tripeptide.",1998,9818356,no
Evaluation of PCR for detection of DNA specific for Aspergillus species in sera of patients with various forms of pulmonary aspergillosis.,"Pulmonary aspergillosis is classified into invasive, saprophytic, and allergic forms. In this study, we evaluated the usefulness of PCR for differentiating between different forms of aspergillosis or in monitoring disease activity during treatment by detecting DNA specific for Aspergillus species in the serum. Nested PCR was used to detect Aspergillus DNA in the sera of 30 patients with various forms of pulmonary aspergillosis. The results were compared with those of latex agglutination tests for detecting galactomannan antigen. We also examined the serial changes in the results of nested PCR during and after treatment of a subgroup of patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis with amphotericin B. The highest proportion of positive nested PCR results were in patients with invasive aspergillosis (10 of 12 83%), while patients with pulmonary aspergilloma had the lowest frequency of positive tests (1 of 9",1998,9817884,no
Softwood hemicellulose-degrading enzymes from Aspergillus niger: purification and properties of a beta-mannanase.,"The enzymes needed for galactomannan hydrolysis, i.e., beta-mannanase, alpha-galactosidase and beta-mannosidase, were produced by the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger. The beta-mannanase was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity in three steps using ammonium sulfate precipitation, anion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration. The purified enzyme had an isoelectric point of 3.7 and a molecular mass of 40 kDa. Ivory nut mannan was degraded mainly to mannobiose and mannotriose when incubated with the beta-mannanase. Analysis by 1H NMR spectroscopy during hydrolysis of mannopentaose showed that the enzyme acts by the retaining mechanism. The N-terminus of the purified A. niger beta-mannanase was sequenced by Edman degradation, and comparison with Aspergillus aculeatus beta-mannanase indicated high identity. The enzyme most probably lacks a cellulose binding domain since it was unable to adsorb on cellulose.",1998,9803534,no
An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the estimation of fungal biomass during solid-state fermentation.,"An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for sensitive, specific and quantitative estimation of fungal biomass during solid-state fermentation is described.

Use of the 27-kilodalton recombinant protein from Paracoccidioides brasiliensis in serodiagnosis of paracoccidioidomycosis.,"Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is one of the most important endemic mycoses in Latin America it is usually diagnosed by observation and/or isolation of the etiologic agent, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, as well as by a variety of immunological methods. Although the latter are effective, two circumstances, cross-reactions with other mycotic agents and antigen preparation that is marked by extreme variability among lots, hinder proper standardization of the procedures. To circumvent this lack of reproducibility, molecular biology tools were used to produce a recombinant 27-kDa-molecular-mass antigen from this fungus",1998,9801343,no
Improved immunodiagnosis of human candidiasis by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a Candida albicans 52-kilodalton metallopeptidase.,"An immunogenic aminopeptidase of Candida albicans was purified by high-performance liquid chromatography. It was then used for the development of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect antibodies directed against this antigen in sera from patients with candidiasis. This enzyme specifically cleaves the L-Arg-7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin substrate at pH 7.4 and was detected in the crude extract of different C. albicans isolates. Sera used for this study were obtained from healthy blood donors or from patients with one of the following: systemic candidiasis, aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, toxoplasmosis, or malaria. The statistical analysis demonstrates significant differences between absorbency values obtained with sera from patients with candidiasis and with sera from the other groups (P = 0.000001). Diagnostic parameters show high diagnostic specificity of 97% and a sensitivity of 83% at a cutoff value of 0.425 and suggest the usefulness of this aminopeptidase for the diagnosis of systemic candidiasis.",1998,9801342,no
Fatal autoimmune hemolytic anemia in a child due to warm-reactive immunoglobulin M antibody.,"Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) due to warm-reactive immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies is rare in adults and has never been described in children. This report describes a pediatric patient with warm AIHA due to high-titer complete IgM antibody.A 9-year-old girl with a history of Evan's syndrome had severe anemia, fatigue, and skin mottling.Serologic evaluation revealed a high-titer, high thermal amplitude (37 degrees C) complete IgM autoantibody. Despite aggressive management (including high dose corticosteroids, intravenous immune globulin, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, whole blood exchange transfusions, and cyclosporine A), the patient remained markedly anemic and developed multiorgan system failure related to diffuse in vivo hemagglutination. Her clinical course included cardiovascular collapse caused by agglutinated red blood cells in the right ventricle with outflow obstruction, cerebrovascular infarcts, hepatic failure, and infarction of her extremities. She ultimately died from disseminated Aspergillosis infection.This rare form of AIHA is associated with a dismal prognosis. Early, aggressive treatment is advocated, although it remains to be seen whether the clinical course can be reversed and the outcome improved.",1998,9787330,no
"Comparison of PCR, (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan and galactomannan assays in sera of rats with experimental invasive aspergillosis.","We compared PCR, galactomannan detection assay using a latex agglutination test and (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan detection assay in detecting infection in rats experimentally infected with Aspergillus fumigatus. On day 2 after inoculation, (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan and nested PCR were positive for 80%, while galactomannan detection assay was positive for 60%. In addition, the positive result of nested PCR (87.5%) was higher than those of galactomannan detection assay (75%) and (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan (71.4%) on day 3 after inoculation. The sensitivity of nested PCR was superior to those of galactomannan detection assay and (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan detection assay. The three diagnostic tests were compared with histopathological findings, and the sensitivity of three diagnostic tests was correlated with histopathological changes. In addition, the elevated levels of (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan paralleled the development and progression of pulmonary aspergillosis. Our results indicate that a combination of two or three of these tests seems to provide a rapid diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis and assist in the evaluation of the development and severity of invasive aspergillosis.",1998,9773954,no
[Complex treatment of infected necrotizing pancreatitis].,"Pancreatic necrosis associated with septic conditions is the leading cause of mortality in acute pancreatitis. Since 1986, 155 patients with infected pancreatic necrosis have been treated. The mean APACHE II score was 18.5 (range 11-32). In all cases, the infected pancreatic necrosis was combined with retroperitoneal abscesses. The surgical treatment was performed on average 18.5 days (range 8-25 days) after the onset of acute pancreatitis. The operative management consisted of wide-ranging necrosectomy in the total affected area, combined with widespread lavage and suction drainage. In 69 of the 155 cases (45%), some other surgical intervention (distal pancreatic resection, splenectomy, cholecystectomy, sphincteroplasty or colon resection) was also performed. Following surgery supportive therapy was applied in all patients, which also consisted orf immunonutrition (glutamine and arginine supplementation) and modification of cytokine production by petoxyfillin and dexamethasone from 1992. TNF and IL-6 serum levels were measured by ELISA and in vitro stimulation of leukocytes were induced by E. coli LPS. Following surgery, continuous lavage and suction drainage were applied for an average of 41.5 days (range 21-90 days), with an average of 9.5 (range 5-20) litres of saline per day. The bacteriologic findings revealed mainly enteral bacteria, but Candida infection was also frequently detected. The incidence of fungal infection was 20%. Thirty-two patients (21%) had to undergo reoperation. The cytokine production capacity (TNF and IL-6) was shown to correlate with the prognosis. As a consequence of pentoxifyllin and dexamethasone therapy, the TNF production generally dropped to the normal level. The overall hospital mortality was 6.4% (10 patients died). In our experience, infected pancreatic necrosis responds well to aggressive surgical treatment, continuous, long-standing lavage and suction drainage, together with supportive therapy consisting of immunonutrition and modification of cytokine production, combined with adequate antibiotic and antifungal medication.",1998,9775652,no
[Quantification of inhaled exposure to alpha-amylase in 2 bakeries].,"Baker's asthma and baker's rhinitis are among the most frequent occupational diseases. A major cause is the high exposure to flour dust in the workplace and to allergenic enzymes like alpha-amylase from Aspergillus oryzae (allergen name: Asp o 2).To quantify allergen exposure in the workplace, 31 personal dust samples in a conventional small bakery (six workers) and in a biobakery (seven workers) were collected. Using a recently developed two-site enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on monoclonal antibodies to alpha-amylase from Aspergillus oryzae, the allergen content of these dust samples was determined.Dust exposure in the biobakery was in the range between 3.5 and 12 mg/m3 (median: 5.2 mg/m3) and in the conventional bakery between 0.9 and 118 mg/m3 (median 8.5 mg/m3). 23 out of 31 exposure measurements showed values higher than 4 mg/m3 (threshold limit value for inhalable dust). In the biobakery, no fungal alpha-amylase could be detected. 15 out of 17 samples taken in the conventional bakery contained fungal alpha-amylase in the range between 0.2 and 88 ng per mg dust. The geometric mean of alpha-amylase exposure in this bakery was 13 ng Asp o 2/m3, and the maximum exposure was 4.8 micrograms/m3. In four cases, fungal alpha-amylase was detected although exposure to dust was below the threshold limit of 4 mg/m3.This study in two German bakeries shows that preventive measures to reduce contact to allergens have not been sufficiently realised. Relevant alpha-amylase exposure occurred at low dust levels illustrating that dust measurements are not adequate to control alpha-amylase exposure. For fungal alpha-amylase an additional threshold limit should be established.",1998,9774870,no
Evaluation and treatment of allergic fungal sinusitis. II. Treatment and follow-up.,"Previous allergic fungal sinusitis case reports have speculated that oral corticosteroids might reduce the severity of disease and possibly forestall the high rate of recurrent sinus surgery.Our objective was to comprehensively review 67 consecutive cases of allergic fungal sinusitis for their response to treatment and the utility of monitoring patient serologies during clinical follow-up.Allergic fungal sinusitis cases from a private practice were evaluated and treated with consistent diagnostic criteria and treatment paradigms. An 8-year retrospective review of serologic parameters and clinical response to treatment with or without oral corticosteroids is described.The total serum IgE was found to correlate with the clinical rhinosinusitis severity (P = .0002). The fungal-specific IgG also correlated with clinical rhinosinusitis severity but less rigorously (P = .004). An increase of 10% or more in total serum IgE during follow-up was found to have significant predictive value for recurrent surgical intervention, with a sensitivity of 79%, specificity of 77%, positive predictive value of 48%, and negative predictive value of 93% (P < .0001). With the use of a modified corticosteroid treatment regimen adapted from allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, as little as 2 months of oral corticosteroids after surgery provided significant clinical improvement for up to 12 months (P < .0001), although patients taking 12 months of treatment fared the best clinically (P = .03). By survival analysis, oral corticosteroids prolonged the time between subsequent sinus surgeries (P = .01) in this highly recurrent disease. No significant side effects of oral corticosteroids were observed during treatment with this dosing regimen.Postoperative oral corticosteroids appear to be an effective treatment option for allergic fungal sinusitis, and monitoring of total serum IgE can be helpful in the clinical follow-up of these patients.",1998,9768579,no
"Regulation of aflR and its product, AflR, associated with aflatoxin biosynthesis.","We studied the role of the regulatory gene aflR and its product, AflR, in the biosynthesis of aflatoxin in Aspergillus. Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses revealed that aflatoxin B1 accumulation was directly related to AflR expression and was regulated by various environmental and nutritional conditions, including temperature, air supply, carbon source, nitrogen source, and zinc availability. Expression of an aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway structural gene, omtA, was regulated by the presence of AflR. Induction patterns for aflR mRNA and AflR were correlated with that for omtA mRNA in an aflatoxin-producing strain of Aspergillus parasiticus. Analysis of non-aflatoxin-producing strains of A. flavus, A. sojae, and A. oryzae grown in medium suitable for aflatoxin B1 production showed that both aflR mRNA and AflR production were present however, omtA mRNA production was not detected in any of these examined strains.

Structural requirements for in vivo myosin I function in Aspergillus nidulans.,"We have investigated the minimal requirements of the tail region for myosin I function in vivo using the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. The CL3 strain (McGoldrick, C. A., Gruver, C., and May, G. S. (1995) J. Cell Biol. 128, 577-587) was transformed with a variety of myoA constructs containing mutations in the IQ, TH-1-like, SH3, and proline-rich domains by frameshift or in-frame deletions of the tail domains. The resulting strains contained wild type myoA driven by the alcA promoter and a mutant myoA driven by its endogenous promoter. This strategy allowed for selective expression of the wild type and/or mutant form of MYOA by the choice of growth medium. Proper septation and hyphal branching were found to be dependent on the interaction of the IQ motifs with calmodulin, as well as, the presence of its proline-rich domain. Additionally, a single proline-rich motif was sufficient for nearly wild type MYOA function. Most surprisingly, the SH3 domain was not essential for MYOA function. These studies expand our previous knowledge of the function of MYOA to include roles in hyphal morphogenesis, septal wall formation, and cell polarity, laying the groundwork for more detailed investigations on the function of the various tail domains in MYOA.",1998,9756952,no

Chest radiographic staging in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis: relationship with immunological findings.,"The question of whether a chest radiographic severity staging system could be correlated with standard blood/serum diagnostic indices in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) was addressed in 41 patients. Asthma and positive Aspergillus fumigatus (AF) serology were considered essential diagnostic inclusion criteria. Eosinophil count, serum immunoglobulin (Ig)E and immediate skin hypersensitivity were also tested to grade patients as ""definite"" or ""likely"" ABPA. Definite cases had all five of these factors present, whereas likely cases had three or more. Chest radiographs were examined by experienced radiologists blinded to the clinical data.

Disease-specific recombinant allergens for the diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), a severe pulmonary complication caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, is considered a complex clinical syndrome with defined serological, pathological radiological and clinical features. The diagnosis of ABPA is often difficult because of several overlapping clinical and laboratory findings shared between asthma with sensitization to A. fumigatus and ABPA, but essential for treatment to prevent severe deterioration of pulmonary function. We have cloned A. fumigatus allergens from a cDNA library displayed on phage surface, sequenced the inserts and produced recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. The single recombinant allergens were used to assess the immunological response in representative groups of A. fumigatus-sensitized asthmatics with or without ABPA and healthy controls. The allergens rAsp f 1, a 16.9 kDa ribotoxin, rAsp f 3, a 18.5 kDa peroxisomal protein, and rAsp f 6, a 23 kDa manganese superoxide dismutase, were identified as proteins with known biological function and rAsp f 4, a 30 kDa allergen, lacks sequence homology to known proteins. The secreted ribotoxin rAsp f 1 and rAsp f 3 are recognized by serum IgE of A. fumigatus-sensitized asthmatics with or without ABPA, whereas the non-secreted manganese superoxide dismutase rAsp f 6 and the rAsp f 4 allergen are exclusively recognized by serum IgE of ABPA patients. The dissection of IgE-mediated immune responses to single recombinant A. fumigatus allergens in asthmatic patients allow a discrimination between ABPA and A. fumigatus sensitization with high specificity (100%) and sensitivity (90%).",1998,9723708,no
Allergy to Aspergillus-derived enzymes in the baking industry: identification of beta-xylosidase from Aspergillus niger as a new allergen (Asp n 14).,"Aspergillus-derived enzymes are used in dough improvers in bakeries. Some of these enzymes are identified as causing IgE-mediated sensitization in up to 25% of bakers with workplace-related symptoms.The aim of this study was to compare the frequency of sensitization to Aspergillus xylanase, cellulase, and glucoamylase with the sensitization to alpha-amylase (Asp o 2) and to identify IgE-reactive proteins in enzyme preparations.Sensitization to Aspergillus-derived enzymes and cross-reactivity were retrospectively studied by enzyme allergosorbent test (EAST) and EAST-inhibition experiments. IgE-reactive proteins were detected by electrophoretic separation and immunoblotting. Liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and Edman degradation of tryptic protein fragments were used for the biochemical identification of an unknown IgE-binding protein.Twenty-three percent of 171 tested bakers had specific IgE to alpha-amylase, 8% reacted to glucoamylase, 13% reacted to cellulase, and 11% reacted to xylanase. Xylanase and cellulase preparations, each containing at least 6 different proteins, showed cross-reactivity in the range of 80%. The main IgE-binding protein in the xylanase preparation recognized in 7 of 8 xylanase-positive subjects was a protein of about 105 kd. This protein was identified as beta-xylosidase by peptide mass spectrometric fingerprinting. The identification was confirmed by matching 12 peptide sequences obtained by N-terminal and mass spectrometric sequencing to this protein.Beta-Xylosidase from Aspergillus niger is an occupational allergen present in currently used baking additives, which causes sensitization in at least 4% of symptomatic bakers. According to the International Union of Immunological Societies nomenclature, we suggest the term Asp n 14 for this allergen.",1998,9723670,no
"Skin-test reactivity and isotype-specific immune responses to recombinant Asp f 3, a major allergen of Aspergillus fumigatus.","The in vitro diagnostic value of recombinant allergens depends on the correlation between allergen specific IgE in serum and ability of the protein to elicit immediate type allergic reactions in sensitized individuals. Objective The study was carried out to evaluate the reliability of recombinant Asp f 3 (rAsp f 3)-based serological determinations in ELISA and ImmunoCAP compared to skin-test responses in A. fumigatus sensitized subjects.Patients suffering from allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA, n=11) or allergic asthma with A. fumigatus sensitization (n =8) and healthy control subjects (n=4) were investigated. Intradermal skin tests (IDT) and allergen-specific serology were performed using rAsp f 3 protein.All 11 patients with ABPA and five out of eight A. fimigatus-sensitized asthmatics without ABPA exhibited a type I skin reaction. All rAsp f 3 skin test positive subjects showed relevant rAsp f 3-specific serum IgE levels compared with IDT-negative individuals who scored below the rAsp f 3-ImmunoCAP cut-off values of < 0.35 kU(A)/L. Analyses of rAsp f 3-specific immunoglobulins revealed significantly higher serum levels of IgG, IgG1, IgG4 and IgE antibodies in patients with ABPA compared with A. fumigatus-sensitized asthmatics and healthy controls.rAsp f 3 represents a major allergen of A. fumigatus. It is recognized by 84% of asthmatic individuals sensitized to the fungus and elicits specific type I skin reactions. The skin test outcome strictly depends on the presence of rAsp f 3-specific IgE and the lack of false positive or false negative results comparing skin test outcome with specific serum IgE levels determined by ELISA or rAsp f 3-ImmunoCAP suggests the possibility to rely on serological data obtained with recombinant allergens to diagnose sensitization to A. fumigatus.",1998,9720820,no
Aspergillus oryzae with and without a homolog of aflatoxin biosynthetic gene ver-1.,"Part of the nucleotide sequence of the ver-1 homolog in each of two strains of Aspergillus oryzae, Aspergillus sojae, and Aspergillus flavus were compared with two homologs in Aspergillus parasiticus. The homologs in A. oryzae and A. sojae (non-aflatoxin-producers) exhibited an extremely high degree (93.8-99.8% for A. oryzae, and 96.0-99.5% for A. sojae) of sequence identify with that of A. flavus and A. parasiticus. No two strains within the same species, except A. sojae, were identical. No sequence fingerprint was found to distinguish between A. oryzae and A. flavus, or between A. sojae and A. parasiticus. The predicted partial amino acid sequences (181 amino acids) of the ver-1 homologs had at most two amino acid changes relative to A. parasiticus SYS-4 ver-1. Transcripts of ver-1 homologs in the strains of A. oryzae and A. sojae examined were not detected by the polymerase chain reaction coupled with reverse transcription. By Southern analysis, a total of 46 strains of A. oryzae were examined for the presence of the ver-1 homolog. The homolog was detected in 38 strains, but not in 8 strains. Morphologically, strains with and without the ver-1 homolog were indistinguishable. Thus, A. oryzae contains strains with and without a homolog of the aflatoxin biosynthetic gene ver-1.",1998,9720206,no
[Aspergillus antigen detection: comparison of a new sandwich ELISA with the latex agglutination test in patients with histologically proven invasive aspergillosis].,A new sandwich antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of Aspergillus galactomannan in blood plasma was compared with the latex-agglutination test by investigation of six patients with histologically proven invasive aspergillosis. The ELISA gave positive results in all six patients while the latex test recognized 5/6 as positive. On an average the antigen ELISA gave positive results 19 days earlier than the latex test.,1998,9717392,no
[Molecular aspects and diagnostic value of fungal allergens].,"Cloning, sequencing and production of highly pure recombinant allergens allows to produce perfectly standardised allergen preparations. The development of a new cloning system based on filamentous phage allowed the fast isolation and characterisation of allergens from the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. The produced recombinant allergens were tested in serological and clinical studies as well as for their performance for routine assessments in the ImmunoCAP-system. Thereby, a perfect correlation between skin test results and serology was found showing the potential of recombinant allergens for the diagnosis of allergic diseases. Moreover, the characterisation of fungal allergens substantially contributes to our understanding of the molecular nature of proteins involved in the elicitation of allergic reactions. Apart from allergenic proteins with unknown biological function, fungal allergens can be subdivided into two classes: 1. Species-specific, secreted proteins and 2. cytoplasmic, even in phylogenetically distant organisms, well conserved proteins. These fungal allergens show extended sequence similarity, a high level of IgE cross-reactivity and in some cases also cross-reactivity with homologous human proteins indicating autoimmune reactions involved in fungal allergy.",1998,9717388,no
Complex chitinolytic system of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Native polyacrylamide gels incorporating a glycol chitin substrate were used to detect several chitinolytic enzymes in the culture filtrate and cell surface, wall and mixed membrane fractions of Aspergillus fumigatus during the exponential phase of growth. Much of the cellular chitinase activity did not bind to concanavalin A (Con A) matrix and was heat-sensitive. In contrast, almost all chitinases secreted appeared to be heat-stable glycoproteins. The heavily glycosylated molecules, in a Con A-binding fraction, were the most immunologically-reactive components, as judged by their binding to anti-Aspergillus antibodies, present in the serum of patients with aspergillosis. Most of the cellular chitinases of A. fumigatus mycelium bound to an insoluble chitin matrix while most of the secreted chitinases did not bind to chitin.",1998,9697338,no
Kartagener's syndrome: a re-visit with Chinese perspectives.,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical, radiological investigation profiles, and ciliary function and ultrastructure in Chinese patients with Kartagener's syndrome (presence of dextrocardia, sinusitis and bronchiectasis). All patients with dextrocardia were assessed for the presence of sinusitis and bronchiectasis in our hospital network. Patients identified with Kartagener's were assessed when they were at steady state for their bronchiectasis. Seven cases (4 males mean age 34.9 years) were identified and systematically reviewed. The mean 24 h sputum volume was 26.6 +/- 32.77 mL/day and the patients suffered from a mean of 2.9 exacerbations/year. Nasal symptoms (anosmia in one, obstruction in six and persistent discharge in three patients) were common. Only two cases (1 M) were married and both had normal fertility. Lung function assessment showed a mean FEV1/FVC of 83.3 +/- 38.78/86.5 +/- 36.72 (% predicted) with little reversibility. High resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) revealed bronchiectactic involvement of the lower lobes in seven and middle lobe/lingula in four cases. Assessment of alpha-1-anti-trypsin, aspergillus precipitins, auto-antibodies and serology for Pseudomonas pseudomallei was normal. Sputum culture yielded Pseudomonas aeruginosa in three, Haemophilus influenzae in three and commensals in one case. Phase contrast microscopy assessment of respiratory cilia, obtained by brushing the inferior turbinate, revealed that most of the mucosa was unciliated. The mean ciliary beat frequency was 5.2 +/- 6.76 Hz (range 0-13.7",1998,9692519,no
The role of bronchial biopsy and washing in the diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"The diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is usually established on the basis of clinical, serologic, and radiologic criteria, of which eight are commonly cited. Although histologic abnormalities are not usually considered, a study of lobectomy/lung biopsy specimens provided evidence that the combination of mucoid impaction of bronchi with ""allergic"" mucin and fungal hyphae is diagnostic of ABPA. We attempted to explore the use of surgical specimens in the diagnosis of ABPA by examining endobronchial biopsy specimens and washings. Bronchial biopsy specimens obtained from 1990 to 1995 that contained fungal hyphae were reviewed and assessed for the presence of ""allergic"" mucin and bronchial wall abnormalities. We also reviewed cytologic specimens and clinical, serologic, and radiologic findings of the corresponding patients. Five biopsy specimens had fungal hyphae and associated ""allergic"" mucin. In some patients, the mucin was small in amount and contained degenerated eosinophils that resembled macrophages. None of the patients was thought to have ABPA clinically. All of the five had bronchial mucoid impaction at bronchoscopy. After additional investigation, only one patient fulfilled all of the eight traditional criteria for ABPA one other patient fulfilled six criteria. Although some tests were not completed in the remaining three patients, follow-up and/or response to steroids was consistent with ABPA in all of the three. Four patients had bronchial washing performed at the time of biopsy. Cytologic examination showed one to be normal except for inflammatory cells that did not include eosinophils",1998,9688180,no
Expression and secretion of defined cutinase variants by Aspergillus awamori.,"Several cutinase variants derived by molecular modelling and site-directed mutagenesis of a cutinase gene from Fusarium solani pisi are poorly secreted by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The majority of these variants are successfully produced by the filamentous fungus Aspergillus awamori. However, the L51S and T179Y mutations caused reductions in the levels of extracellular production of two cutinase variants by A. awamori. Metabolic labelling studies were performed to analyze the bottleneck in enzyme production by the fungus in detail. These studies showed that because of the single L51S substitution, rapid extracellular degradation of cutinase occurred. The T179Y substitution did not result in enhanced sensitivity towards extracellular proteases. Presumably, the delay in the extracellular accumulation of this cutinase variant is caused by the enhanced hydrophobicity of the molecule. Overexpression of the A. awamori gene encoding the chaperone BiP in the cutinase-producing A. awamori strains had no significant effect on the secretion efficiency of the cutinases. A cutinase variant with the amino acid changes G28A, A85F, V184I, A185L, and L189F that was known to aggregate in the endoplasmic reticulum of S. cerevisiae, resulting in low extracellular protein levels, was successfully produced by A. awamori. An initial bottleneck in secretion occurred before or during translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum but was rapidly overcome by the fungus.",1998,9687432,no
Mammary and systemic aspergillosis in dairy sheep.,"Mammary aspergillosis was diagnosed in four flocks of dairy sheep, comprising a total of 1,750 ewes. These animals had been treated prophylactically by intramammary infusion with cloxacillin 5 months prior to lambing. Mammary aspergillosis with concomitant spread to the regional lymph nodes was present in these flocks in a percentage ranging from 2% to 36.4% of treated sheep. Pathologic, bacteriologic, and mycologic studies were performed in seven of the affected ewes. Some of them also had lung, kidney, and liver involvement. The pathologic reaction within lesions ranged from the acute to subacute type, dominated by necrosis and vasculitis with thrombosis, to the chronic granulomatous type, with macrophages and giant cells. The distribution of lesions and the presence of a remarkable vasculitis with fungal thrombi in the mammary gland suggested a hematogenous dissemination of the infection from this organ. Immunologic staining with monoclonal antibody MAb-WF-AF-1, which reacts specifically with Aspergillus hyphae, identified the causative agent in histologic sections of the different affected tissues. The etiologic diagnosis was further supported by the isolation of Aspergillus fumigatus in pure culture from affected tissues and from eight samples of mammary secretions.",1998,9684966,no
Sensitization to different species of Aspergillus in bakery workers and general atopic population.,"Six species of Aspergillus predominant in the bakery environment--Aspergillus flavus, A. fumigatus, A. nidulans, A. ochraceous, A. sydowi and A. versicolor--were studied for their role in causing Type 1 hypersensitivity among bakery workers and atopic patients from the general population (PGP). Antigenic extracts from the above species were prepared for in vivo and in vitro studies. The IEF, SDS-PAGE, skin test, ELISA and immunoblot techniques were performed to detect the biochemical- and clinico-immunological characteristics of these species. Among those tested, the important fungal sensitizers among the bakery workers and patients from the general population were A. sydowi, A. fumigatus, A. nidulans and A. ochraceous. The protein fractions of different species were in the acidic region (pI 3.0-6.5) and in the molecular weight range of 13.0-91.0 kDa. The protein fraction of 44.0 kDA of A. flavus and 20.0 and 70.0 kDa for A. fumigatus showed IgE binding in the sera of bakery workers only. Significantly, raised IgG antibodies to different species were recorded among the bakery workers as compared to the PGP group. The study showed that different species of Aspergillus are of potential allergenic significance in bakery workers and the general atopic population.",1998,9681123,no
Post-mortem findings in patients with repeatedly mycological demonstration of Candida glabrata.,"In our mycological laboratory we saw an increase in the occurrence of Candida glabrata isolates from 0.5% in 1990 to 22.2% in 1996, mainly isolates of high-risk patients of the intensive care unit and the oncological ward. We were interested to analyse whether this increase in C. glabrata was also demonstrable in a corresponding number of deep-seated candidosis. Eighteen patients were autopsied and examined microscopically. In all patients, repeated occurrence of C. glabrata, with or without C. albicans during the hospital treatment, was found. Serology and fungal cultures of these intensive care/oncological patients were indicative of invasive candidosis. In 12 of these 18 patients, there was no evidence of deep-seated candidosis at autopsy. Three patients had a typical aspergillosis of the lungs, which was not diagnosed during their hospital treatment. In five patients (two of them with an aspergillosis of the lungs), we found sporadic yeast cells in kidney or lung tissue, characterized by size and missing pseudomycelium as C. glabrata. In no case was a cellular intravital defensive reaction against these yeast cells found. Therefore, we interpreted the demonstration of C. glabrata in tissues as a transitory fungaemia and not as a deep-seated C. glabrata mycosis.",1998,9670764,no
[Infective endocarditis caused by unusual microorganisms].,"All series of infective endocarditis had a variable proportion of cases without an etiologic agent because all cultures were negative. New microbiologic techniques have permitted the discovery of the role of many microorganisms in infective endocarditis. C. burnetii is an increasing causative agent of subacute infective endocarditis. In the diagnosis, to the detection of antiphase-I antibodies, immunohistochemical, molecular techniques and cellular cultures have been added. Total cure is difficult to obtain. The combination of doxicicline plus ciprofloxacin for at least 3 years has been proposed as the treatment of choice. Surgery must be reserved for patients with cardiac insufficiency. Less than 2% of cases of acute brucellosis are complicate with infective endocarditis. Infective endocarditis produces serious and rapid valvular destruction with high mortality rates if valve surgery is not performed. For medical treatment at least 3 active agents are required. Bartonella has recently been described as an etiologic agent of infective endocarditis. It mainly affects to homeless people living in poor hygienic conditions. The aortic valve is most commonly involved and, frequently, valve insufficiency requires valve replacement. Blood culture isolation needs long incubation periods. Parenteral nutrition, immunosuppression, wide spectrum antibiotic regimens, intravenous drug addiction and cardiovascular surgery are risk factors previously described in the development of fungal endocarditis. C. albicans and Aspergillus spp. are most frequent etiologic agents. Infective endocarditis should be suspected in any patient with systemic fungal disease. Blood cultures are often negative except for Candida spp. Peripheral emboli and large vegetations are frequent. Mortality is high, antifungal therapy combined with surgery is the treatment of choice. Legionella, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Mycobacteria, viruses are potential agents of infective endocarditis, and difficult to diagnose because of special culture requirements. Epidemiological clues, serologic and molecular techniques and blood cultures could identify them.",1998,9658953,no
"Overproduction of soluble, extracellular cytotoxin alpha-sarcin in Escherichia coli.","The goal of the present study was to establish the condition to obtain preparative amounts of the recombinant cytotoxin alpha-sarcin to be used for immunoconjugate production. alpha-Sarcin cDNA was isolated from Aspergillus giganteus strain MDH 18,894 and its expression in Escherichia coli was attempted by the use of both two-cistron and fusion protein-expression systems. Whereas the former resulted in low intracellular expression level of recombinant alpha-sarcin (r-Sar), the latter allowed high-level expression of the fusion protein in the culture supernatant. A variant form of alpha-sarcin with an additional threonine residue in position 1 (Thr-Sar) was obtained by proteolytic processing of the fusion protein with a final yield after purification of 40 mg/L of culture. Both recombinant proteins r-Sar and Thr-Sar were identical to native a-sarcin with respect to the biochemical properties and to the in vitro biological activity.",1998,9658388,no
Detection of immunoglobulins G and A to Aspergillus fumigatus by immunoblot analysis for monitoring Aspergillus-induced lung diseases.,"The aim of the study was to investigate whether patients with Aspergillus-induced lung disease can be monitored by immunoblot analysis to detect antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus (Af). Immunoblotting was performed by incubating 57 longitudinally collected sera from 13 patients on nitrocellulose sheets, blotted with Af antigen, separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Bound antibodies were demonstrated by peroxidase-labelled antihuman immunoglobulins (Ig)G and IgA antiserum and diaminobenzidine plus H2O2 as substrate. The immunoblot patterns were related to the patients' clinical status and time. Each patient had a characteristic immunoblot pattern that varied with time. There was a relationship between disease activity or clinical response and changes in immunoblot antibody patterns: a rise in anti-Af IgG and IgA antibodies was seen in sera collected during active disease, compared with before active disease, and a significant decline in anti-Af IgG and IgA was demonstrated in sera collected during recovery, compared with during active disease. Only in the acute stage of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis were IgA antibodies against Af antigens of <20,000 Da demonstrated. Immunoblot analysis can be used to monitor the disease activity and the responses to treatment of patients with Aspergillus-induced lung diseases. Changes in specific immunoglobulin A may be more informative than specific immunoglobulin G.",1998,9657566,no
Serologic survey of free-living nestling prairie falcons (Falco mexicanus) for selected pathogens.,"Serum samples from 34 free-living nestling prairie falcons (Falco mexicanus) in southwestern Idaho were negative for antibodies to avian influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus, and three Aspergillus species.

Comparison of serum galactomannan antigen detection and competitive polymerase chain reaction for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis.,"To improve the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA), we retrospectively compared competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sandwich ELISA for detection of serum galactomannan (GM) antigen. We studied 281 serum samples collected weekly during the period at risk for IA from 41 selected hematology patients. Twenty-two patients had confirmed, probable, or suspected IA, according to clinical and mycologic data. Fifteen of them had positive GM titers (87 samples) and 12 had positive PCRs (20 samples). Nineteen of the 20 PCR-positive samples were also GM-positive. Of the 19 patients without IA (83 samples), one had 3 GM-false-positive samples. Neither test anticipated the initiation of antifungal therapy on the basis of clinical suspicion. Both tests were more likely to be positive before death. This study suggests that PCR on serum samples is not more sensitive than GM detection. However, PCR can improve the specificity of the GM test. Together, these noninvasive tests should improve the diagnosis of IA.",1998,9636871,yes
Alkaline serine proteinase: a major allergen of Aspergillus oryzae and its cross-reactivity with Penicillium citrinum.,"Aspergillus species are common indoor airborne fungi and have been considered as causative agents of human allergic disorders. However, allergens of different Aspergillus species have not been effectively characterized. The object of this study was to identify and characterize IgE-binding components of Aspergillus oryzae.Allergens of A. oryzae were identified by immunoblot analysis using sera from asthmatic patients. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of allergens thus identified were determined by Edman degradation. The antigenic and the allergenic cross-reactivities between allergens of different fungi were analyzed by immunoblotting and immunoblot inhibition analysis, respectively, using a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) 55A against the 33-kD major allergen of Penicillium citrinum and a mixture of IgE-containing asthmatic serum samples.Thirteen components of A. oryzae ranging in apparent molecular weight from 16 to 42 kD react with IgE antibodies. A 34-kD component that showed intense IgE-binding reactivity and was detectable in the highest frequency in our asthmatic serum samples tested was considered a major allergen of A. oryzae. The 34-kD component also reacted with MoAb 55A. Results from immunoblot inhibition studies also demonstrated the IgE cross-reactivity between the 34-kD major allergens of A. oryzae and P. citrinum. In addition, the sequence of the N-terminal 18 amino acid residues of the 34-kD major allergen of A. oryzae was found to be identical to that of the alkaline serine proteinase from the same Aspergillus species.The 34-kD major allergen of A. oryzae is an alkaline serine proteinase. There is IgE cross-reactivity between the major serine proteinase allergens of A. oryzae and P. citrinum.",1998,9623506,no
Detection of antigen in sera of patients with invasive aspergillosis: intra- and interlaboratory reproducibility. The Dutch Interuniversity Working Party for Invasive Mycoses.,"The intra- and interlaboratory reproducibilities of a commercial sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of Aspergillus galactomannan in serum (Platelia Aspergillus Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur, Marnes-La-Coquette, France) were evaluated in six laboratories of university hospitals. Twenty serum samples were obtained from 12 neutropenic patients including 6 with invasive aspergillosis. These samples were blinded and sent to each center together with eight blinded ELISA-negative serum samples spiked with known concentrations of galactomannan. The centers were provided with ELISA microtiter plates from a single batch and a detailed protocol. Ten clinical samples showed ELISA reactivity, while 10 samples were ELISA negative. The mean coefficient of variation (CV) of the optical density values was 4.24% within a single assay and 25.6% between runs. The interassay CV of the ratios for the serum samples tested was 18.6%. Analysis of ordinal interpretation of the ELISA result (i.e., negative, gray zone, or positive) showed excellent reproducibility. Recalculation of the cutoff values for positive and negative samples suggested that the cutoff level recommended by the manufacturer could be lowered from 1.0 to 0.8 for negative samples and from 1.5 to 1.0 for positive samples. The intra- and interlaboratory reproducibilities were excellent when the ELISA results were interpreted as ordinal data, but considerable variation in optical density values and, to a lesser extent, in the ratios for the serum samples tested, was observed between runs. High assay variability was also found for serum samples spiked with known concentrations of galactomannan. Therefore, antigen titers in serum samples from a single patient, measured in different runs, should be compared with caution.",1998,9620387,no
Secretion of the sweet-tasting protein thaumatin by recombinant strains of Aspergillus niger var. awamori.,"A recombinant form of the sweet-tasting protein thaumatin has been produced in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger var. awamori. Expression cassettes containing a synthetic gene encoding thaumatin II were prepared and used to transform Aspergillus niger var. awamori strain NRRL312. Several fungal strains capable of synthesizing and secreting thaumatin into the culture medium were generated, and their production capabilities were determined, first in shake flasks and later in a laboratory fermentor.

"Secretion, purification, and characterisation of barley alpha-amylase produced by heterologous gene expression in Aspergillus niger.","Efficient production of recombinant barley alpha-amylase has been achieved in Aspergillus niger. The cDNA encoding alpha-amylase isozyme 1 (AMY1) and its signal peptide was placed under the control of the Aspergillus nidulans glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpd) promoter and the A. nidulans trpC gene terminator. Secretion yields up to 60 mg/l were obtained in media optimised for alpha-amylase activity and low protease activity. The recombinant AMY1 (reAMY1) was purified to homogeneity and found to be identical to native barley AMY1 with respect to size, pI, and immunoreactivity. N-terminal sequence analysis of the recombinant protein indicated that the endogenous plant signal peptide is correctly processed in A. niger. Electrospray ionisation/mass spectrometry gave a molecular mass for the dominant form of 44,960 Da, in accordance with the loss of the LQRS C-terminal residues glycosylation apparently did not occur. The activities of recombinant and native barley alpha-amylases are very similar towards insoluble and soluble starch as well as 2-chloro-4-nitrophenol beta-D-maltoheptaoside and amylose (degree of polymerisation = 17). Barley alpha-amylase is the first plant protein efficiently secreted and correctly processed by A. niger using its own signal sequence.",1998,9615479,no
Comparison of an enzyme immunoassay and a latex agglutination system for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in bone marrow transplant recipients.,"The performance of two Aspergillus antigenemia systems, the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Platelia Aspergillus test, and the latex agglutination (LA), Pastorex Aspergillus test, in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis were compared by testing 364 serum samples from 22 bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. Sensitivity and specificity for the ELISA test were 60% and 82% respectively, vs 40% and 94% for the LA test. In the two patients found positive with both methods, the ELISA test became positive earlier than the LA test or remained positive after the LA test had become negative. These results encourage further evaluation of the Platelia Aspergillus test, to assess its role in the management of invasive aspergillosis in BMT patients.",1998,9613784,yes
Allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis to Fusarium vasinfectum in a child.,"A 12-year-old boy with asthma and 6 years of recurrent pneumonias who had normal serum immunoglobulin concentrations was suspected of having allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA).To search for and secure a fungal etiology for a child who did not have ABPA but was suspected of having an allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis.Immediate skin testing with fungal extracts, high resolution computerized tomography, and establishment of an ELISA procedure to detect serum IgE and IgG antibodies to Fusarium vasinfectum.Immediate skin reactivity was present for Fusarium, Cladosporium, Helminthosporium, and Aspergillus fumigatus. The ELISA demonstrated serum IgE and IgG antibodies to Fusarium vasinfectum 8.5 and 5.6 times nonatopic control sera.This 12-year-old with asthma has sufficient criteria for a diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPM) to Fusarium vasinfectum.

Identification and purification of specific Penicillium marneffei antigens and their recognition by human immune sera.,"Disseminated infection with the dimorphic pathogenic fungus Penicillium marneffei is increasingly seen among patients with AIDS in southeast Asian countries. Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of humoral immune responses to this fungus in patient sera we have confirmed this work using sera from P. marneffei-infected patients (n = 21) to develop Western blots of P. marneffei cytoplasmic yeast antigen (CYA). P. marneffei CYA was then partially purified by liquid isoelectric focusing, and fractions were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting. Immunoenzyme development of the Western blots with pooled sera from patients with P. marneffei infection and with pooled sera from patients with aspergillosis (n = 20), candidiasis (n = 10), cryptococcosis (n = 9), and histoplasmosis (n = 11) revealed three antigens with relative molecular masses of 61, 54, and 50 kDa. These antigens were specifically recognized by the pooled sera from the P. marneffei-infected patients. The 61- and 54-kDa antigens were subsequently purified to homogeneity by preparative gel electrophoresis, and the 50-kDa antigen was partially purified by the same technique. N-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed that the 61-kDa antigen had a strong homology (87% identity) with the antioxidant enzyme catalase. The three antigens were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting and to immunoenzyme development with individual patient sera",1998,9542914,no
Aeroallergens and viable microbes in sandstorm dust. Potential triggers of allergic and nonallergic respiratory ailments.,"Aeroallergens and antigens in sandstorm dust, extracts of which were skin prick test (SPT) positive in allergic patients, were detected by rocket immunoelectrophoresis and ELISA. Fungi and bacteria isolated by agar settle plates and soil dilution and soil washing methods were enumerated and identified. Cat dander, Acacia, Alternaria, Aspergillus, Chenopodium, Cladosporium, Bermuda grass, Pithecellobium, Prosopis, Rumex, cultivated rye, and Washingtonia palm allergens were detected by both methods. Viable microbes including 1892 +/- 325 colony-forming units (cfu) of bacteria, and 869 +/- 75 cfu of fungi were isolated per gram of dust by the soil dilution method. Randomly selected microbial colonies on streaking and subculture were found to consist of between two and seven mixed colonies. Fungi including Alternaria, Aspergillus, Botrytis, Cladosporium, Mortierella, Mucor, Mycelia sterilia, Penicillium, Pythium, Ulocladium, Verticillium, and some yeasts were isolated. Actinomyces, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, and mostly coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species were identified, but the bulk of unidentified bacterial isolates were mainly mixed colonies of rods, cocci, coccobacilli, and some filamentous types. Six-hour agar settle-plate counts during sandstorms were 100 and 40% higher for bacteria and fungi, respectively, than without sandstorms. The most abundant aeroallergens were those of Acacia, Alternaria, Aspergillus, Bermuda grass, Cladosporium, cultivated rye, Prosopis, and cat dander. Pithecellobium dulce, Rumex crispus, and Washingtonia palm allergens were detectable for the first time in Riyadh. IgE reactivities of the dust in man were demonstrated by ELISA using sera from atopic, exposed, and normal subjects. These results indicate that sandstorm dust is a prolific source of potential triggers of allergic and nonallergic respiratory ailments, and the methods mentioned here should be routinely used for quick sampling of the environment.",1998,9542605,no

The patient had eosinophilic infiltration elevated serum IgE, RAST against Aspergillus )(A.) fumigatus, a positive immediate skin reaction, and a positive test for antibodies against A. funmigatus. Bronchoscopy demonstrated mucoid impaction that plugged the middle lobe bronchus. The mucoid plug contained A. terreus and numerous eosinophils. Because the level of the precipitating antibody for counter immunoelectrophoresis against A. terreus was higher than that at A. fumigatus, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillus caused be A. terreus was diagnosed.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis due to an ultrasonic humidifier.,"We describe a woman with hypersensitivity pneumonitis that was related to using a home ultrasonic humidifier. A micronodular infiltrate was seen in her chest radiograph. The inhalation challenge test was performed with the humidifier, and she exhibited a positive response. The cultures of the humidifier water grew Candida albicans, Rhodotorula spp., and Aspergillus spp. The test for precipitating antibodies against the humidifier water gave a positive response, and specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies against extracts of A. fumigatus, C. albicans, and Rhodotorula spp. were demonstrated in the patient's serum by ELISA.

"Overproduction of 1,2-alpha-mannosidase, a glycochain processing enzyme, by Aspergillus oryzae.","A recombinant strain of Aspergillus oryzae has been constructed in which 1,2-alpha-mannosidase, an intracellular glycochain processing enzyme with specificity toward 1,2-alpha-mannosidic linkages, has been overexpressed. For the construction, the N-terminal signal-encoding sequence of the 1,2-alpha-mannosidase gene (msdC) from Penicillium citrinum was replaced with that of the aspergillopepsin I signal, and the fused gene was inserted between amyB promoter-terminator elements in the expression plasmid pTAPM1. A transformant of A. oryzae (the strain PM-1) secreted a great deal of heterogeneous 1,2-alpha-mannosidase into the culture media, which was purified by CM ion-exchange chromatography. Approximately 21 mg of the purified enzyme was obtained per liter of culture. N-terminal amino acid analysis indicated that the signal peptide was removed from the secreted enzyme. The Penicillium 1,2-alpha-mannosidase expressed in A. oryzae did not show any notable difference from the enzyme from P. citrinum in such properties as M(r), specific activity, CD spectra, or kinetic parameters. Man7GlcNAc2 accumulated temporarily during the degradation of Man9GlcNAc2 to Man5GlcNAc2 by fungal 1,2-alpha-mannosidase.",1998,9532788,no
Group specific antibodies against the putative AMP-binding domain signature SGTTGXPKG in peptide synthetases and related enzymes.,"The superfamily of adenylate forming enzymes including peptide synthetases, acyl-CoA synthetases and insect luciferases is readily identified by the signature sequence SGTTGXPKG. This sequence including an invariant lysyl residue is located in a disordered loop region and was predicted to be of significant antigenicity. Antibodies were generated employing YTSGTTGRPKGC attached to bovine serum albumin and have been successfully used to identify respective enzymes and adenylate forming domains in multienzyme systems. These include the delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine synthetases of Aspergillus nidulans and Acremonium chrysogenum, gramicidin S synthetase 1 and tyrocidine synthetase 1 from Bacillus brevis, acetyl-CoA synthetase from Alcaligenes eutrophus and a putative peptide synthetase from Metarhizium anisopliae. Weaker or no reactions are observed when the amino acid in position X in the protein is non-basic or hydrophobic, which is respectively the case for gramicidin S synthetase 1 and luciferase.",1998,9530507,no
IgE down regulation and cytokine induction by Aspergillus antigens in human allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), occurring primarily in patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis (CF), is a hypersensitivity reaction to Aspergillus fumigatus (Af), and is characterized by increased serum IgE levels and peripheral blood and pulmonary eosinophilia. We evaluated the IgE and cytokine profile in ABPA through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and evaluated eosinophil activity with the eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) assay. IgE and cytokines were measured in supernatants from cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from three subject groups: ABPA patients, patients with asthma, and healthy individuals. All cultures for the three subject groups were studied in the presence and absence of two purified Af antigens (the 35-kD antigen and heat shock protein 1). We found that increased in vitro levels of IgE in unstimulated PBMC culture supernatants correlated significantly with serum IgE concentrations in ABPA patients. We measured a decrease in IgE levels of up to 75% of baseline values in supernatants from PBMC cultured with Af antigens. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) concentrations in cultures with Af were increased in ABPA, whereas concentrations of IL-4 did not differ in the three subject groups. An inverse relation was noted between the changes in IgE and IFN-gamma measured in 4 of 5 ABPA patients. The PBMC supernatants also promoted EPO activity in purified eosinophils from ABPA patients, and to a lesser extent in purified eosinophils from healthy subjects. These results show that the 35-kD antigen and HSP1 from Af downregulate IgE in vitro but are capable of inducing eosinophilia in ABPA. Further studies could result in the characterization of epitopes leading to these disparate effects. An identification of the IgE-down-regulating epitopes in Af antigens might have therapeutic significance.",1998,9523846,no
Health evaluation of free-ranging and hand-reared macaws (Ara spp.) in Peru.,"As part of ongoing ecological studies and reproduction enhancement efforts for macaws in southwestern Peru, a health survey of parent- and hand-reared scarlet macaws (Ara macao) and blue and gold macaws (Ara ararauna) was conducted in 1994. Thirty-three birds were examined during handling procedures, and blood samples were collected from 27 (9 parent reared, 18 hand reared) for laboratory analysis. All but one bird appeared to be in good condition, with no abnormality noted during physical examination. Hematology, plasma chemistries, and plasma vitamin and mineral levels were studied and correlated with the results of bacterial and viral serology. Positive antibody titers for Salmonella and psittacine herpesvirus were found. These diseases have the potential to affect wildlife population dynamics, and Salmonella may have public health significance. Serological tests for avian influenza, infectious laryngotracheitis, paramyxovirus-1, -2, -3, polyoma virus, chlamydiosis, and aspergillosis were negative. Differences in disease prevalence were found between rearing situations.",1998,9523629,no
Development of a two-site enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for alpha-amylase from Aspergillus oryzae based on monoclonal antibodies.,"A two-site monoclonal antibody ELISA was developed to quantify the allergen Asp o 2 (alpha-amylase from Aspergillus oryzae). Two mAbs recognizing distinct epitopes were selected, enriched by in vitro production in a modular minifermenter and affinity-purified. The first antibody was bound to microtiter plates which were then incubated with samples containing the allergen. Bound allergen was detected using a biotinylated second antibody and peroxidase-polymer-labelled streptavidin. The assay had a sensitivity of 0.6 ng/ml and did not react to high concentrations of wheat and rye flour or yeast proteins. The mAb ELISA will be useful in individual or epidemiological studies of baker's asthma to assess workplace allergen concentrations and the efficacy of allergen exposure prevention. It can be used as a standard assay for the quantification of alpha-amylase and the establishment and control of threshold limits in European bakeries.",1998,9502588,no
Elevated amniotic fluid nitric oxide metabolites and interleukin-6 in intra-amniotic infection.,"To compare amniotic fluid nitric oxide metabolites and interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations in patients with and without intra-amniotic infection.Amniotic fluid nitric oxide metabolites, IL-6, Gram stains, glucose, leukocyte counts, leukocyte esterase activity, creatinine, pH, and specific gravity were determined in 14 patients with intra-amniotic infection and 26 patients without intra-amniotic infection. Intra-amniotic infection was defined as the presence of a positive amniotic fluid culture. The nitric oxide metabolites, nitrate and nitrite (NOx), were measured using Greiss reagent after reduction of nitrate to nitrite with aspergillus nitrate reductase. Interleukin-6 was measured by a two-site, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Amniotic fluid nitric oxide metabolites and IL-6 concentrations were normalized by amniotic fluid creatinine levels. The Mann-Whitney U test, contingency table method, and Spearman's rank correlation test were used for statistical analyses.Amniotic fluid NOx and IL-6 levels were significantly higher in patients with intra-amniotic infection than in those without intra-amniotic infection (NOx: median = 2.06 mumol/mg creatinine, range = 0.74-6.81 versus 1.35 mumol/mg creatinine, range = 0.99-1.60, P = .01, IL-6: median = 2.00 micrograms/mg creatinine, range = 0.026-4.07 versus median = 0.04 micrograms/mg creatinine, range = 0.004-3.210, P = .0009, respectively). Patients with intra-amniotic infection had significantly elevated leukocyte counts, leukocyte esterase activity, Gram positive stains, and significantly lower amniotic fluid glucose levels compared with those without intra-amniotic infection. There were no differences in gestational age, maternal age, parity, race, pH, or specific gravity between the two groups. Amniotic fluid NOx was significantly correlated with IL-6 (r = .4, P = .02). Both amniotic fluid NOx and IL-6 were also positively correlated with amniotic fluid leukocyte counts, leukocyte esterase activity and Gram stains, and negatively correlated with glucose levels.Amniotic fluid NOx and IL-6 are significantly elevated and positively correlated during intra-amniotic infection. Both increased amniotic fluid IL-6 and nitric oxide may exert cytotoxic and cytostatic effects on the target cells. We suggest that measurements of amniotic fluid NOx and IL-6 may serve as useful clinical markers in patients with intra-amniotic infection.",1998,9501294,no
Action of Trichoderma reesei and Aspergillus oryzae esterases in the deacetylation of hemicelluloses.,"Xylans and mannans contain different esterified substituents such as acetyl, feruloyl and p-coumaroyl side groups. The functions of hemicellulose-deacetylating esterases of Trichoderma reesei and Aspergillus oryzae are discussed in this paper. Both fungi produce multiple esterases and two different esterases were isolated from both T. reesei and A. oryzae. The enzymes differed significantly in their substrate specificities. Acetyl xylan esterase of T. reesei was highly active on polymeric xylan but was unable to remove acetyl substituents from glucomannan or phenolic substituents from wheat straw arabinoxylan. Another esterase, acetyl esterase from T. reesei, had activity only towards short oligomeric and monomeric acetates derived both from xylan and glucomannan. The acetyl glucomannan esterase of A. oryzae was most active towards polymeric glucomannan, but was also able to remove acetyl groups from xylan. The only esterase studied which was active against phenolic substituents in arabinoxylans was the feruloyl esterase from A. oryzae. Feruloyl esterase had the widest substrate specificity of the esterases studied. It was also able to act on acetyl groups both in xylan and in glucomannan. The simultaneous enzymic liberation of acetyl groups from xylan and glucomannan clearly enhanced the action of xylan- and mannan-degrading enzymes, thus increasing the hydrolysis yield significantly. However, none of the esterases was able to remove all acetyl substituents when acting alone and simultaneous action of two esterases was needed for complete deacetylation.",1998,9477552,no
The recombinant antigen ASPND1r from Aspergillus nidulans is specifically recognized by sera from patients with aspergilloma.,"A 996 bp Aspergillus nidulans cDNA encoding the ASPND1 immunodominant antigen was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with the enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST) from Schistosoma japonicum. The GST-ASPND1 fusion protein was purified from isolated bacterial inclusion bodies by preparative SDS-PAGE. After cleavage with thrombin, the ASPND1 recombinant antigen (ASPND1r) and the GST protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with a number of different human sera. The sera from 22 (88%) of 25 patients with an aspergilloma recognized the ASPND1r recombinant antigen on immunoblots. Forty-nine normal human sera and 14 sera from patients with other infections were unreactive. The ASPND1r expressed in E. coli could therefore be used, in combination with previously reported recombinant antigens, as a standardized antigen for serological and clinical diagnosis of Aspergillus-associated diseases.",1998,9493392,no
Western blot analysis of the immune response to Candida albicans antigens in 391 long-term intensive care patients.,"The aim of this study was to determine, using Western blot, the prevalence of anti-Candida albicans antibodies in long-term intensive care patients and to characterize specific immune responses that may only occur in patients with invasive candidosis. A total of 1751 serum samples from 391 patients of a German multicentre study, which was designed to determine the incidence of systemic candidosis, was examined. Significantly enhanced antibody production against specific antigens was observed in several subgroups of patients, i.e. those with underlying disease of the pancreas (29 kDa, P = 0.006), cholecystolithiasis (47 kDa, P = 0.029), gastrointestinal tract disease (47 kDa, P = 0.03), steroid therapy (58 kDa, P = 0.02), thrush (58 kDa, P = 0.032), urogenital infection (58 kDa, P = 0.034), Candida antigen titre > or = 1:4 (58 kDa, P = 0.002) and positive fungal culture (36 kDa, P = 0.033) and those who had died (36 kDa, P = 0.011). In contrast to earlier publications, an immune response against the 29 and 47 kDa antigens was relatively common among long-term intensive care patients (37% and 70% antibody positive respectively). A single antigen that provided satisfactory sensitivity and specificity for the discrimination between fungal infection and no fungal infection or between superficial and invasive fungal infection was not identified in this study.",1998,9476481,no
Detection of Aspergillus galactomannan antigen in foods and antibiotics.,"The specificity of the Pastorex Aspergillus latex agglutination test for the diagnosis of manifest aspergillosis is hampered by the occurrence of false-positive results. In order to prove whether or not the false-positive reactions may be caused by the uptake of the soluble galactomannan antigen from the environment, the presence of the antigen was tested in foods, air samples, antibiotics for therapeutic use and faeces. Reactions of the Aspergillus latex agglutination test were found in 15 (79%) out of 19 samples of meals prepared in a hospital kitchen, in five out of six canned vegetables from a supermarket, in all of six samples of pasta and rice bought in health shops, in the faeces of four bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients and of four healthy subjects and in one and two batches of the antibiotics co-amoxyclav and piperacillin respectively. The concentration of the antigen in faecal material was calculated to be in the range of 1.2-38.4 micrograms g-1. It is concluded that the faecal galactomannan antigen may reach the circulation in patients with dysfunction of the intestinal mucosal barrier, e.g. BMT recipients, thus leading to diagnostically false-positive antigenaemia.",1998,9470421,no
"Isolation and analysis of xlnR, encoding a transcriptional activator co-ordinating xylanolytic expression in Aspergillus niger.","Complementation by transformation of an Aspergillus niger mutant lacking xylanolytic activity led to the isolation of the xlnR gene. The xlnR gene encodes a polypeptide of 875 amino acids capable of forming a zinc binuclear cluster domain with similarity to the zinc clusters of the GAL4 superfamily of transcription factors. The XlnR-binding site 5'-GGCTAAA-3' was deduced after electrophoretic mobility shift assays, DNase I footprinting and comparison of various xylanolytic promoters. The importance of the second G within the presumed XlnR binding site 5'-GGCTAAA-3' was confirmed in vitro and in vivo. The 5'-GGCTAAA-3' consensus sequence is found within several xylanolytic promoters of various Aspergillus species and Penicillium chrysogenum. Therefore, this sequence may be an important and conserved cis-acting element in induction of xylanolytic genes in filamentous fungi. Our results indicate that XlnR is a transcriptional activator of the xylanolytic system in A. niger.",1998,9466262,no
Pulmonary nodules in liver transplant recipients.,"Pulmonary nodules present a diagnostic dilemma in liver transplant recipients because of the broad differential diagnosis involved. Eleven of 155 (7.1%) liver transplant recipients at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Pittsburgh, developed pulmonary nodules. The underlying etiology included aspergillosis (3 cases), cryptococcosis (2), metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (1), posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1), squamous cell carcinoma (1), adenocarcinoma of unknown primary site (1), and undifferentiated carcinoma (1). A review of the literature revealed 22 other liver transplant recipients with pulmonary nodules. There appears to be a definite relationship between time since transplantation and etiology of the nodule. Aspergillosis and bacterial infections appear early (within the first month), whereas nocardiosis, coccidiomycosis, tuberculosis, and cryptococcosis occur from 3 to 24 months posttransplantation. Metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma is a relatively common cause of pulmonary nodule and appears from 2 months to 2 years posttransplantation. Detection of skin lesions (indicating nocardiosis or cryptococcosis) and positive serologic tests may further narrow the diagnosis. However, radiographic appearances of nodules of differing etiology are relatively nonspecific, necessitating biopsy in virtually all cases.",1998,9465863,no
Substrate specificities of Penicillium simplicissimum alpha-galactosidases.,"The substrate specificities of three Penicillium simplicissimum alpha-galactosidases, AGLI, AGLII, and AGLIII, were determined by using various isolated galactose-containing oligosaccharides and polymeric galacto(gluco)mannans. AGLI released galactose from melibiose and raffinose-family oligosaccharides but the amount of galactose released was decreased from 96% to 35% by the increasing chain length of the substrate from raffinose to verbascose. It was able to release galactose linked to the nonreducing end and less efficiently to the internal residues of the galactomanno-oligomers. AGLI was able to hydrolyze 60-92% of galactose from polymeric galacto(gluco)mannans alone but its action was facilitated by mannanase and beta-mannosidase. In addition, it was able to release about 10% of the galactose from softwood kraft pulp alone and about 22% in combination with mannanase. AGLII was highly specific toward small galactose-containing oligosaccharides in which the galactose is linked to the nonreducing end of the substrate. It released 90-100% of galactose present in melibiose, raffinose, stachyose, and verbascose however, it was able to degrade polymeric substrates only in combination with mannanase and beta-mannosidase. AGLIII had only low activity toward the oligomeric substrates tested. It was able to release some galactose from the polymeric galacto(gluco)mannans alone, but its action was clearly enhanced by the backbone degrading enzymes.",1998,9463945,no
Expression of the cefG gene is limiting for cephalosporin biosynthesis in Acremonium chrysogenum.,"The conversion of deacetylcephalosporin C to cephalosporin C is inefficient in most Acremonium chrysogenum strains. The cefG gene, which encodes deacetylcephalosporin C acetyltransferase, is expressed very poorly in A. chrysogenum as compared to other genes of the cephalosporin pathway. Introduction of additional copies of the cefG gene with its native promoter (in two different constructions with upstream regions of 1056 bp and 538 bp respectively) did not produce a significant increase of the steady-state level of the cefG transcript. Expression of the cefG gene from the promoters of (i) the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpd) gene of Aspergillus nidulans, (ii) the glucoamylase (gla) gene of Aspergillus niger, (iii) the glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) and (iv) the isopenicillin N synthase (pcbC) genes of Penicillium chrysogenum, led to very high steady-state levels of cefG transcript and to increased deacetylcephalosporin-C acetyltransferase protein concentration (as shown by immunoblotting) and enzyme activity in the transformants. Southern analysis showed that integration of the new constructions occurred at sites different from that of the endogenous cefG gene. Cephalosporin production was increased two- to threefold in A. chrysogenum C10 transformed with constructions in which the cefG gene was expressed from the gdh or gpd promoters as a result of a more efficient acetylation of deacetylcephalosporin C.",1998,9421924,no
Allergens of Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida boidinii share IgE-binding epitopes.,"From an Aspergillus fumigatus complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) library displayed on phage surface, an allergen formally termed rAsp f 3 was cloned. The open-reading frame of the cloned gene for the allergen encodes a protein of 168 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 18.5 kD, showing 36% identity and 58% similarity to two peroxisomal membrane proteins of Candida boidinii. Recombinant Asp f 3 was expressed as a [His]6-tagged fusion protein in Escherichia coil at yields of 30 mg/L, and was purified by Ni(2+)-chelate chromatography. In an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), serum IgE antibody reactivity to rAsp f 3 could be detected in 72% of 89 individuals sensitized to A. fumigatus, demonstrating that the protein represents a major allergen of the mold. IgE specific to rAsp f 3 and the two recombinant Candida proteins was further demonstrated by IgE-immunoblot analysis. IgE binding to rAsp f 3 could be inhibited in the ELISA by adding either of the recombinant Candida peroxisomal proteins to sera containing IgE directed against Asp f 3. Taken together, these observations prove that the Asperigillus allergen and the two Candida proteins share IgE-binding epitopes.",1997,9412580,no
Two strategies for managing invasive aspergillosis: a decision analysis.,"We devised a diagnostic approach based on screening plasma for an Aspergillus antigen with use of a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), thoracic computed tomographic scanning, and radionuclide imaging for managing patients at risk for invasive aspergillosis. We used a decision analytic model to compare this alternative strategy with the conventional strategy, which relies only on the presence of clinical symptoms, persistent fever, and chest roentgenographic findings. Use of the alternative strategy reduced the number of patients who would receive antifungal treatment empirically, but this strategy was more expensive. The specificity of the sandwich ELISA had a significant impact on cost, but the sensitivity did not. A 13% prevalence of infection resulted in equal costs for both strategies. As much as 43.3% of the patients treated empirically could be given liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) before the conventional strategy became the most expensive. The costs of the alternative strategy were less than those of the conventional strategy when >5.3% of all patients, irrespective of strategy, were treated with L-AmB.",1997,9402374,no
Detection of antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus in serum of horses with mycosis of the auditory tube diverticulum (guttural pouch).,"To detect antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus antigens in serum samples from horses and to evaluate the relevance of this method as an alternative approach to the diagnosis of mycosis of the auditory tube diverticulum (guttural pouch mycosis [GPM]).Twelve clinically normal horses (controls) and 12 horses with GPM diagnosed by endoscopic observation of characteristic mycotic plaques.Antibodies to A fumigatus antigens were detected in serum by use of an ELISA and immunoblot analysis with extracellular antigens.Antibodies against A fumigatus antigens were found in healthy and diseased horses. Titer of total Aspergillus antibodies was not diagnostic for GPM. In contrast, immunoblot analysis results indicated that 2 antigens of 22 and 26 kd were constantly recognized by sera from diseased horses.Reactivity to 22- and 26-kd A fumigatus antigens, as measured by immunoblot analysis, seemed to be diagnostic for GPM in horses.",1997,9401681,no
Elisa based diagnostic test for Aspergillosis.,"Detection of lgE and lgG antibodies in Aspergillosis is of diagnostic significance. The serological methods, such as agglutination, gel diffusion and counter immuno electrophoresis that are commonly used in the laboratories for diagnosis of Aspergillus induced infections, are less sensitive and high cross reactivity is often encountered. We carried out work on characterization and identification of diagnostically relevant antigens ofA. fumigatus. Well characterized antigens were used to develop an ELISA with 92% sensitivity and 89% specificity for detection of specific lgE and lgG in the sera of patients of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), aspergilloma and invasive aspergillosis. Subsequently, a sample kit having ""ready to use type"" of dry reagents (powder/tableted buffers and lyophilized antigen, conjugate and reference sera) was formulated. The kit was validated with sera from patients of ABPA, related allergic disorders, tuberculosis, post-Kochs cases and thalassemic children receiving repeated blood transfusions.

Immuno-polymerase chain reaction for detection ofAspergillus fumigatus.,"A number of Aspergillus infections are caused by the opportunistic fungal pathogenAspergillus fumigatus in humans especially under immunosuppressed conditions. Major forms of the disease include invasive aspergillosis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and aspergilloma. A procedure that uses chitinase and microwave treatment is described for the extraction of genomic DNA of Aspergillus species from the sputum and bronchial aspirate of patients with established aspergillosis. Detection ofA.fumigatus was compared by culture, microscopy, serology by ELISA, immunodiffusion, agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR products and colorimetric immuno-PCR. A colorimetric method for the detection of PCR product was developed based on immunoaffinity reactions. Out of the clinical samples tested from nineteen patients, fourteen were positive and five were negative by all the methods tested. It was established that at least 1 pg of DNA was extractable from the clinical samples sufficient to produce enough quantities of PCR product for detection on agarose gel or by immunoaffinity based color reaction. An absorbance value of 0.9 to 1.5 against 0.2 for negative control was obtained at 405 nm for colorimetric immuno-PCR. This method can be exploited for screening large number of clinical samples from immunocompromized as well as from suspected cases of aspergillosis.",1997,23100915,no
"Elevated amniotic fluid nitric oxide metabolites and cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate in pregnant women with intraamniotic infection.","Our purpose was to compare amniotic fluid nitric oxide metabolites and cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate in pregnant women with and without intraamniotic infection.Amniocentesis was performed on 72 pregnant women with preterm contractions, labor, or rupture of membranes. Fourteen patients had intraamniotic infection and 58 did not. Intraamniotic infection was defined as the presence of a positive amniotic fluid culture. Amniotic fluid Gram stain, glucose, leukocyte counts, leukocyte esterase activity, creatinine, pH, and specific gravity were performed. Endogenous nitrite was determined using Griess reagent. Amniotic fluid nitric oxide metabolites (nitrite and nitrate) were measured after reduction of nitrate to nitrite with Aspergillus nitrate reductase. Tests for amniotic fluid cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels were determined by enzyme immunoassay. Two-tailed t test, contingency table methods, linear regression, and correlation were used for statistical analyses.Amniotic fluid levels of nitric oxide metabolites, endogenous nitrite, nitrate, and cyclic guanosine monophosphate were significantly higher in pregnant women with intraamniotic infection than in those without intraamniotic infection (2.66 +/- 0.49 vs 1.77 +/- 0.07 mumol/mg creatinine, p = 0.002 0.69 +/- 0.15 vs 0.38 +/- 0.03 mumol/mg creatinine, p = 0.003Our data indicate that amniotic fluid nitric oxide and cyclic guanosine monophosphate may play important roles in the pathogenesis of intraamniotic infection. Measurements of amniotic fluid nitric oxide metabolites and cyclic guanosine monophosphate may be part of a panel of tests that can be used to detect intraamniotic infection.",1997,9369821,no
Airways obstruction in patients with long-term asthma consistent with 'irreversible asthma'.,"To describe a series of eight patients with long-term asthma and pulmonary function consistent with ""end-stage,"" irreversible obstruction.Retrospective descriptive analysis of patients with severe asthma.A university-based allergy-immunology service with a large population of corticosteroid-dependent patients with asthma.Eight patients with long-standing asthma and apparently irreversible airways obstruction despite long-term oral and inhaled corticosteroid therapy.Pulmonary function data, radiographic studies including chest radiograph and high-resolution CT of the chest, and serologic analysis to rule out allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency had been performed as indicated, and these results were obtained through chart review.The age of the patients ranged from 41 to 58 years, with a mean duration of asthma of 39 years (SD = 12.4 years). No patient had evidence of any other pulmonary disease process. The mean duration of daily or alternate-day oral corticosteroid treatment was 15.8 years (SD=11.8 years). Despite intensive pharmacotherapy, all patients had an FEV1 57% (42+/-12%) with marked small airways disease as reflected in the forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of the FVC. Three of the eight patients demonstrated an accelerated decline in FEV1 despite continuous systemic corticosteroids.We have described a series of eight patients with long-standing asthma who demonstrate irreversible airways obstruction despite long-term systemic and inhaled corticosteroids.

"Ribonuclease activity dependent cytotoxicity of Asp fl, a major allergen of A. fumigatus.","A major allergen/antigen, Asp fl, secreted by Aspergillus fumigatus exhibits cytotoxicity towards eukaryotic cell lines. Asp fl inhibited protein synthesis in RAW cells with an IC50 of 4.5 nM and also degraded ribosomal RNA of RAW cells at a similar concentration. Ribosomal inactivation by Asp fl may be the probable mechanism for protein synthesis inhibition. Specific ribonuclease activity of Asp fl was observed to be 100,000 U/mg. Presence of strong RNase activity in Asp fl was further confirmed by agar gels containing yeast RNA. Electrophoretic run on agarose gels showed that Asp fl degrades all species of naked RNA. Modification of histidine residues of Asp fl with diethyl pyrocarbonate and alkylation of cysteines with iodoacetamide resulted in loss of ribonuclease activity and cytotoxicity of Asp fl. The current study establishes the ribonuclease activity of a purified major allergen of A. fumigatus that inhibits protein synthesis and kills the eukaryotic cells.",1997,9350029,no
"Five crucial carboxyl residues of 1,2-alpha-mannosidase from Aspergillus saitoi (A. phoenicis), a food microorganism, are identified by site-directed mutagenesis.","An acidic 1,2-alpha-mannosidase from fungus, Aspergillus saitoi (now designated Aspergillus phoenicis), is highly specific for 1,2-alpha-mannosidic linkage in the high-mannose type oligosaccharide at pH 5.0. The predicted amino acid sequence of several peptide regions, including aspartic acid and glutamic acid, bears striking similarities to 1,2-alpha-mannosidases from fungi, yeast and mouse. Active site determination of the enzyme expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells was performed by site-directed mutagenesis. Substitutions of Asp-269 to Glu and of the Glu-residues, Glu-273, Glu-411, Glu-414 and Glu-474, to Asp altered the drastic decrease of specific activities with Man alpha 1-2Man-OMe and Man9-GlcNAc2-PA as substrates and shifted the optimal pH of the mutant enzymes. From the present results, Asp-269 is probably in the ionized COO- form, whereas one of four glutamic acid residues, probably Glu-411, is the un-ionized COOH form according to the analogy of a plausible mechanism for lysozyme catalysis. It is assumed that three glutamic acid residues, Glu-273, Glu-414, and Glu-474, are probably binding sites of substrate.",1997,9325167,no
Cytologic specimens from the eye: a clinicopathologic study of 33 patients.,"Cytologic specimens from the eye (CSE) (fine-needle aspirates and intraocular [vitrectomy] washings) are uncommon in most cytology practices. We reviewed our experience and diagnostic accuracy in lesions from this site over a 13-yr period. Thirty-three patients (12 males, 21 females, age 7-85 yr mean 56 yr) were identified. Eighteen specimens were submitted to rule out malignancy. Of these, four CSE were positive, including melanoma (n = 1), large-cell lymphoma (n = 2), and carcinoma (n = 1). None of the 14 patients with negative cytology showed clinical evidence of malignancy over a 1-28-mo follow-up period (mean, 8.4 mo). Fourteen specimens were submitted to rule out infectious agents. Cytology material contained culture-proven organisms in one case each of Candida and Aspergillus. Of serology-confirmed specimens, four CSE failed to reveal toxoplasma, and three lacked herpes viral inclusions. One case each of culture-positive P. acnes and C. albicans lacked the organisms in the CSE. Twelve specimens were submitted to rule out inflammatory lesions. CSE showed chronic inflammation (n = 5), acute and chronic inflammation (n = 1), macrophages (n = 5), and nonnecrotizing granulomas (n = 1). Of 3 patients with sarcoidosis, CSE contained mature lymphocytes in all 3 cases, but no granulomas.

Development of a novel antigen detection test for histoplasmosis.,"Histoplasmosis is an important systemic fungal infection, particularly among immunocompromised individuals living or travelling in areas of endemicity, who, without antifungal therapy, may develop a progressive disseminated fatal infection. For such patients, the detection of antibody responses by immunodiffusion or complement fixation test is of limited use. In contrast, the detection of Histoplasma capsulatum circulating antigens may provide a more practical approach to the rapid diagnosis of the disease. Accordingly, an inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of a 69- to 70-kDa H. capsulatum-specific determinant and incorporating a species-specific murine monoclonal antibody was developed. With sera from patients with different forms of the disease (n = 35), the overall sensitivity of the test was found to be 71.4%, while the specificity was found to be 98% with normal human sera from areas of endemicity (n = 44) and 85.4% with sera from patients with other chronic fungal or bacterial infections (n = 48). This novel, highly specific ELISA provides a significant addition to the existing diagnostic tests for the detection of histoplasmosis.",1997,9316918,no
Immunoreactivity of a 38-kilodalton Penicillium marneffei antigen with human immunodeficiency virus-positive sera.,"Penicillium marneffei produced and secreted a 38-kDa antigen that appeared to be specific for this dimorphic fungus. This component could not be detected in antigenic extracts of Histoplasma capsulatum, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus terreus, Candida albicans, and two other species of Penicillium by immunoblot analysis against the sera from patients with culture-confirmed penicilliosis marneffei. Antibody reactive with this antigen was found in a large proportion of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients, indicating a presumptive diagnosis of P. marneffei infection. A small number of asymptomatic HIV-seropositive patients and HIV-seropositive patients with other fungal infections were also found to be positive by this analysis, suggesting that subclinical or mixed fungal infections involving P. marneffei are not uncommon.",1997,9276391,no
[The typical radiological findings and course of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in the immunosuppressed patient].,"This retrospective study was designed to show whether invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, which is often difficult to diagnose by bronchoscopy or serology, can be diagnosed at an early stage by typical radiological findings on conventional radiographs or by CT, specially high resolution CT (HR-CT).In 19 Patients with 20 disease episodes, 20 thorax radiographs and eight spiral CT examinations were performed and in four cases HR-CT was also available. The earliest pathological findings and the course of the disease were analysed and the results of the various examinations were compared.90% of chest examinations, including CT and HR-CT, showed the following lesions as part of the earliest changes: round or wedge-shaped opacities or the so-called ""halo"" sign. CT or HR-CT always demonstrated more lesions than plain chest radiographs 75% of lesions appeared typical and thereby contributed to the diagnosis.The typical radiological findings of round or wedge-shaped opacities and the so-called ""halo"" sign are additional criteria for the diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The superiority of CT or HR-CT in the demonstration of pathological changes suggests that these should be used early in the investigation of patients who are specially at risk.",1997,9289038,no
Serum Aspergillus galactomannan antigen testing by sandwich ELISA: practical use in neutropenic patients.,"The double sandwich ELISA detecting Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) was prospectively evaluated for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in 50 haematological patients at risk for IA. Serum samples were collected once weekly as long as the risk factors persisted. Six patients had proven or probable IA (3 A. fumigatus, 1 A. flavus, 1 A. niger, 1 A. ustus) and the GM titres were parallel to the clinical evolution of IA. Six of nine patients with suspected IA had at least two consecutive serum GM titres above 1 ng/ml and died with increasing titres, whereas the GM-negative patients survived. Positive GM titres did not anticipate the isolation of fungi. Unfortunately, positive GM titres did not anticipate the initiation of antifungal therapy, based on clinical suspicion. Moreover, if a true-positive result was defined as two consecutive positive serum samples, four patients out of 35 without proven, probable or suspected IA were positive. Then, the rate of false-positive results was high (12%) in the range previously reported. Nevertheless, the GM ELISA appears useful to assess IA and to follow the efficacy of antifungal treatment.",1997,9279718,no
Murine macrophage elastolytic activity induced by Aspergillus fumigatusstrains in vitro: evidence of the expression of two macrophage-induced protease genes.,"The interaction between Aspergillus fumigatus conidia and murine macrophages of various origins was investigated. Cocultures were carried out between A. fumigatus strains and freshly isolated murine pulmonary alveolar macrophages or two murine macrophage cell-lines: murine alveolar cell-line MALU and murine astrocytoma cell-line J774. By measuring the variation of elastolytic activity in the coculture supernatants with two elastin substrates, we demonstrated that either viable or fixed A. fumigatus or C. albicans yeasts or nonspecific particles induced significant macrophage elastolytic activity. The effect of A. fumigatus supernatant or the purified A. fumigatus galactomannan suggested also the possible involvement of this polysaccharide in macrophage-protease gene expression, release, and activity in invasive aspergillosis. The effect of inhibitory compounds demonstrated the potential implication of a macrophagic metalloprotease and a macrophagic cysteine protease. RNA analysis allowed us to demonstrate the induction of expression of two macrophagic protease genes in stimulated macrophages. Two distinctive mechanisms appeared to be implicated in macrophage protease induction: nonspecific phagocytosis in the earliest times of the coculture and (or) specific galactomannan recognition after its gradual release by the mycelium.",1997,9246742,no
Recurrence of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in the posttransplant lungs of a cystic fibrosis patient.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease of exocrine origin. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is an immunologic disorder caused by colonization of the airways with Aspergillus fumigatus. A fumigatus has been cultured from posttransplant lungs in CF patients. Colonization of posttransplant lung with Aspergillus is a recognized phenomenon. In this case report, however, we present a patient who developed ABPA both before and after lung transplant. This patient meets the criteria for ABPA based on serologic results. ABPA may be a complication in post-CF lung transplant patients and serologic analysis should be considered when eosinophilia and pulmonary infiltrates or decline in lung function occurs.",1997,9228393,no
Immunoreactivity of antigen extracts of Aspergillus fumigatus isolated from different sources.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is the result of hypersensitivity to Aspergillus antigens in patients with long-standing atopic asthma. In the present study mycelial and culture filtrate antigens from Aspergillus fumigatus cultures isolated from diverse sources were tested against sera of 10 ABPA patients and 10 control individuals by an ELISA methodology. The results indicate higher antibody reactivity against both antigens in the sera of ABPA patients, while culture filtrate antigens also gave non-specific reactivity with control sera. Mycelial extracts, in general, were useful in the diagnosis of ABPA.",1997,16854172,no
[Successful use of fluconazole against semi-invasive--pulmonary aspergillosis].,"A 53-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of productive coughing general malaise, and right-sided chest pain. At 41 years of age he was given a diagnosis of gastric cancer, underwent a and gastrectomy, was treated with anti-cancer drugs. At 49 years of age he suffered from atypical mycobacteriosis and received anti-tuberculosis drugs for 1 year. A chest X-ray film showed infiltrative shadows with a cavity in the right upper lung field. Semi-invasive aspergillosis was diagnosed on the basis of the clinical and radiographic findings, positive sputum cultures, and positive serologic tests. After 8 months of therapy with intravenous and oral fluconazole, no pulmonary aspergillosis was evident. Treatment with fluconazole was effective in this case of semi-invasive aspergillosis.",1997,9379561,no
Guidelines for the investigation of invasive fungal infections in haematological malignancy and solid organ transplantation. British Society for Medical Mycology.,"Invasive fungal infections are increasing in incidence and now affect as many as 50% of neutropenic/bone marrow transplant patients and 5 to 20% of solid organ transplant recipients. Unfortunately, many of the diagnostic tests available have a low sensitivity. The guidelines presented here have been produced by a working party of the British Society for Medical Mycology in an attempt to optimise the use of these tests. The yield of fungi from blood cultures can be increased by ensuring that at least 20 ml of blood are taken for aerobic culture, by using more than one method of blood culture, and by employing terminal subculture if continuous monitoring systems are used with a five-day incubation protocol. Skin lesions in febrile neutropenic patients should be biopsied and cultured for fungi. The detection of galactomannan in blood or urine is of value in diagnosing invasive aspergillosis only if tests are performed at least twice weekly in high-risk patients. Antigen detection tests for invasive candidiasis are less valuable. Computed tomography scanning is particularly valuable in diagnosing invasive pulmonary fungal infection when the chest radiograph is negative or shows only minimal changes. Bronchoalveolar lavage is most useful in patients with diffuse changes on computed tomography scan. The major advances in the diagnosis of invasive fungal infection in patients with haematological malignancy or solid organ transplantation have been in the use of imaging techniques, rather than in the development of new mycological methods in the routine laboratory.",1997,9248745,no
[Significance of Aspergillus fumigatus rDNA detected by polymerase chain reaction in diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis].,"We have studied the clinical significance of Aspergillus fumigatus rDNA detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for diagnosing aspergillosis. For this purpose, a specific and sensitive PCR assay was developed to amplify the 26S rDNA/intergenic spacer region of A. fumigatus. Control experiments showed that the set of primers used was capable of amplifying A. fumigatus DNA specifically and that the DNA amount of detection limit was 1 pg. Eighteen samples from 13 patients with aspergillosis and 36 samples from 24 patients without aspergillosis were tested by means of PCR, culture, latex agglutination test for galactomannan antigen and double gel diffusion assay for precipitation of antibodies to A. fumigatus. PCR showed positive test in 8 among 13 patients with pulmonary aspergillosis. On the other hand, culture of samples detected A. fumigatus in 6 patients. Galactomannan antigen and antibodies specific to A. fumigatus were positive in 2 and 6 patients respectively. These results indicated that PCR is the most sensitive among these 4 methods. Five patients showed negative PCR test despite of having pulmonary aspergillosis. Two of these patients were proved to have aspergillosis caused by A. flavus and A. niger. On the other hand, galactomannan antigen and A. fumigatus antibody were positive in one and 2 patients, respectively. PCR was positive in 2 out of 24 patients diagnosed as not having aspergillosis: one patient had diagnosis of acute bronchitis, but she showed positive culture of A. fumigatus. The other patient had diagnosis of lobar pneumonia, because any pathogens were not detected before PCR assay. The PCR assay we developed is a useful method for diagnosing aspergillosis caused by A. fumigatus as compared with other conventional methods.",1997,9248266,no
"Purification of a major allergen, Asp f 2 binding to IgE in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, from culture filtrate of Aspergillus fumigatus.","Most cases of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) are caused by the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. Successful treatment of this disease depends on early diagnosis with the use of well-characterized and relevant antigens/allergens of the organism.The aim of this study was to purify and characterize relevant proteins from A. fumigatus that could be used in the reliable diagnosis of ABPA.Monoclonal antibodies were raised against A. fumigatus culture filtrate antigens. A Concanavalin A nonbinding protein fraction was purified with use of one of the monoclonal antibody immunoaffinity columns. The purified protein was analyzed on sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel and Western blots. The sensitivity and specificity of the purified protein were evaluated by RAST and ELISA with sera from 25 patients with ABPA, from 10 with allergic asthma, and from 10 normal control subjects.The 37 kD Concanavalin A nonbinding protein reacted specifically with IgE antibodies in patients with ABPA. Among the 25 patients with ABPA studied, 96% had IgE antibody against the allergen, whereas none of the subjects with allergic asthma who had positive results on the skin prick test or normal control subjects had a reaction. Both RAST and ELISA results exhibited strong correlation with IgE binding. This allergen exhibited N-terminal sequence identity to a recombinant allergen Asp f 2.A 37 kD protein with complete N-terminal homology to Asp f 2 is a major allergen of A. fumigatus that significantly reacts with IgE antibody in patients with ABPA, but does not elicit reaction in Aspergillus-sensitive subjects with asthma and normal control subjects.",1997,9215251,no
"Valproic acid-ketoconazole interaction in normal, hypoalbuminemic, and uremic sera: lack of interaction in uremic serum caused by the presence of inhibitor.","Ketoconazole is an antifungal agent widely used in the management of patients with fungal infection, especially in patients with acute acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Ketoconazole is 99% bound to serum albumin and may interact with valproic acid, an anticonvulsant with 90% to 95% binding to serum albumin. The interaction may be more significant in hypoalbuminemia, a common finding in patients with AIDS. However, valproic acid-ketoconazole interaction has not been reported. The authors prepared two serum pools from patients receiving valproic acid with normal serum albumin and another pool from patients with hypoalbuminemia. Another serum pool was prepared from uremic patients not receiving valproic acid. The aliquots of serum pool were supplemented with various concentrations of ketoconazole, representing therapeutic and slightly higher therapeutic concentrations. The concentrations of free valproic acid were determined in protein-free ultrafiltrates (prepared by centrifuging specimens at 25 degrees C with the Centrifree Micropartition System at 1500 g for 20 minutes) using fluorescence polarization immunoassay. In the serum pool with normal albumin concentration, the authors observed statistically significant displacement of valproic acid only at higher ketoconazole concentrations (10 and 20 micrograms/ml) whereas, in the serum pool with hypoalbuminemia, they observed statistically significant displacement of valproic acid by ketoconazole with lower and higher concentrations of ketoconazole. The magnitude of displacement was more significant at high valproic acid concentrations (95 and 150 mg/ml, respectively) probably because of the concentration-dependent binding of valproic acid to serum albumin. The authors observed no displacement of valproic acid by ketoconazole in the uremic serum pool. On the other hand, the free valproic acid concentrations were decreased in the presence of ketoconazole in the uremic serum pool.",1997,9200768,no
Fungal allergens from important allergenic fungi imperfecti.,"Occurrence of several fungal species in the environment seems to be related to hypersensitivity disorders in humans. Fungal allergen studies reported in the literature are reviewed regarding to Aspergillus, Alternaria, Penicillium and Cladosporium genera. In this paper, we study by means of in vivo (Skin Prick Test) and in vitro (RAST and immunoblotting) the classical question of the best source of allergenic material using a population of asthmatic patients sensitized to different mould genera. In Alternaria alternata, RAST values are considerably higher in metabolic extracts (culture filtrate) than in somatic ones (myceliar). In Alternaria alternata and Penicillium chrysogenum, low molecular weight allergens (< 30 kDa) show higher IgE-binding activity in culture filtrate extracts. In Aspergillus fumigatus we find some relevant allergens in the mycellium. Different fractions have also been used in skin tests and culture filtrate extracts showing higher potency than myceliar ones, what is in agreement with the former results. We found in Penicillium chrysogenum that the 67 kDa allergen, similar to what described by Shen et al (1991), showed inespecific binding to anti-IgE conjugate used in the development of the immunoblotting technique. Whether or not this component could be a major allergen is discussed. We discuss about the importance of the biology of fungi in the sensitization and development of mould allergy.",1997,9208052,no
Polycystic kidney disease: an unrecognized emerging infectious disease?,"Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is one of the most common genetic diseases in humans. We contend that it may be an emerging infectious disease and/or microbial toxicosis in a vulnerable human subpopulation. Use of a differential activation protocol for the Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay showed bacterial endotoxin and fungal (1-->3)-beta-D-glucans in cyst fluids from human kidneys with PKD. Fatty acid analysis of cyst fluid confirmed the presence of 3-hydroxy fatty acids characteristic of endotoxin. Tissue and cyst fluid from three PKD patients were examined for fungal components. Serologic tests showed Fusarium, Aspergillus, and Candida antigens. IgE, but not IgG, reactive with Fusarium and Candida were also detected in cyst fluid. Fungal DNA was detected in kidney tissue and cyst fluid from these three PKD patients, but not in healthy human kidney tissue. We examine the intertwined nature of the actions of endotoxin and fungal components, sphingolipid biology in PKD, the structure of PKD gene products, infections, and integrity of gut function to establish a mechanistic hypothesis for microbial provocation of human cystic disease. Proof of this hypothesis will require identification of the microbes and microbial components involved and multifaceted studies of PKD cell biology.",1997,9204292,no
Anti-Candida albicans IgE and IgG subclasses in sera of patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA).,"We performed immunoblotting experiments to determine specific IgE and IgG subclass responses to Candida albicans antigens in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) patients. This is a first report describing C. albicans antigens recognized by serum IgE and IgG subclasses of ABPA patients sensitized to that yeast. Among the various antigens reacting with serum IgE, a 43-kDa component was recognized by all seven patients and can be considered a major antigen of C. albicans for this particular group of patients. By comparison, only 20% of a group of asthmatic atopics (25 patients) and 10% of a group of normal controls (10 subjects) were 43-kDa positive. Multiple banding patterns, revealing no major antigen, were observed for all four IgG subclasses except for IgG1 in one case. In particular, the 43-kDa component was not always recognized by all the patients. Furthermore, oral or inhaled steroid treatment appears to have no impact on the specific IgE immunopatterns obtained. Using immunoelectron-microscopy, we localized IgE-binding primarily in the mannoprotein-containing layers of the C. albicans cell wall. In conclusion, C. albicans-IgE and IgG subclasses may participate in the physiopathology of ABPA by exacerbating pulmonary infiltrates (IgE) and inducing eosinophil-mediated inflammatory reaction (IgG1, IgG3).",1997,9188920,no
NMR study of the galactomannans of Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Trichophyton rubrum.,"Around 90% of chronic dermatophyte infections are caused by the fungi Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Trichophyton rubrum. One of the causes of the chronic infection resides in the immunosuppressive effects of the cell-wall components of these organisms. Therefore we have attempted to identify the chemical structure of galactomannan, one of the major cell-wall components. The cell-wall polysaccharides secreted by T. mentagrophytes and T. rubrum were isolated from the culture medium and fractionated into three subfractions by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. Analysis of each subfraction by NMR indicated that there are two kinds of polysaccharides present, i.e. mannan and galactomannan. The mannan has a linear backbone consisting of alpha1,6-linked mannose units, with alpha1,2-linked mannose units as side chains. The core mannan moiety of the galactomannan was analysed by a sequential NMR assignment method after removing the galactofuranose units by acid treatment. The result indicates that the mannan moiety has a linear repeating structure of alpha1,2-linked mannotetraose units connected by an alpha1,6 linkage. The H-1 signals of the two intermediary alpha1, 2-linked mannoses of the tetraose unit showed a significant upfield shift (Deltadelta=0.05-0.08 p.p.m.), due to the steric effect of an alpha1,6-linked mannose unit. The attachment point of the galactofuranose units was determined at C-3 of the core mannan by the assignment of the downfield-shifted 13C signals of the galactomannan compared with those of the acid-modified product. In these galactomannans there were no polygalactofuranosyl chains which have been found in Penicillium charlesii and Aspergillus fumigatus.",1997,9173896,no
"Chemical and functional properties of mutastein, an inhibitor of insoluble glucan synthesis by Streptococcus sobrinus.","Mutastein, a potent inhibitor of insoluble glucan synthesis by Streptococcus sobrinus, is a protein with a molecular weight of approximately 2 x 10(6). Amino acid and ELISA analyses suggested that mutastein is a mixture of heterogenous polymers of alpha-casein contained in the culture medium of the producing strain, Aspergillus terreus M3328. Mutastein strongly inhibited the primer-dependent insoluble glucan synthase of S. sobrinus B13. The primer-independent soluble glucan synthase was not affected by mutastein while primer-dependent soluble glucan synthase was slightly activated.",1997,9145515,no
Disseminated histoplasmosis in a human immunodeficiency virus-infected African child.,"Progressive disseminated histoplasmosis (PDH), a recognized defining illness of AIDS, is an opportunistic fungal infection caused by Histoplasma capsulatum.  The authors report a case of PDH in a HIV-infected African child from a Histoplasma capsulatum non-endemic area.  An 8-year-old girl from Kwazulu/Natal, South Africa, was admitted to King Edward VIII hospital with pyrexia and respiratory distress.  Pale with generalized lymphadenopathy, she had been sick with general malaise and fever for 3 weeks.  A punched-out painless ulcer was present on the child's lower left leg and she had ulcerative lesions on the tip of her tongue and the angle of her mouth.  There was a tender hepatomegaly and clinical signs of pneumonia, while a chest roentgenogram showed right upper lobe consolidation with early cavitation.  The purified protein derivative tuberculin skin test was negative and no acid-fast bacilli were detected on three sputum samples taken on different days.  A Western blot test conducted for antibodies to HIV was positive.  Additional laboratory tests were conducted.  The patient was treated with parenteral acyclovir for herpesvirus infection, ceftriaxone for severe community-acquired pneumonia, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole because Pneumocystis carinii infection was part of the clinical differential diagnosis.  Bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy revealed yeast forms of H. capsulatum.  The girl died on the second day of hospital admission, before antifungal therapy could be commenced.",1997,9109150,no
Fungal pneumonias.,"An increased incidence of fungal pneumonias has been clearly seen in recent years, despite the lack of epidemiologic data. Pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations of blastomycosis, aspergillosis, and histoplasmosis, among others, are reviewed in this paper. The clinical presentation of pulmonary mycosis is influenced by the amount of exposure to the fungus and the host's immune response, and particular attention is paid in this review to the immunosuppressed patient. Recent reports of diagnostic tools such as bronchoscopy, imaging methods, and serologic tests are reviewed. Developments in aggressive therapies are discussed.",1997,9193861,no
Serial monitoring of Aspergillus antigen in the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. Preliminary investigations with two examples.,"A recently developed sandwich ELISA, which detects Aspergillus galactomannan, was tested retrospectively in serial serum samples from an allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipient with proven invasive aspergillosis (patient 1) and another with suspected disease (patient 2). Galactomannan was detected in the serum 4 and 28 days, respectively, before pulmonary infiltrates suggestive of fungal infection first became apparent on the chest X-ray. Aspergillus was detected by ELISA and PCR in BAL fluid samples from both patients, and in CSF from patient 1. The diagnosis was confirmed at autopsy for patient 1 by histopathology and the recovery of Aspergillus fumigatus from the lung and brain. Furthermore, in both patients the course of the antigen titer in the serum during antifungal treatment corresponded with the clinical outcome. These results confirm that the sandwich ELISA appears to be useful for the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. The value of the test for monitoring the response to antifungal treatment remains to be established in prospective trials.",1997,9108182,no
Expression of a Bacillus thuringiensis cryIA(c) gene in transgenic peanut plants and its efficacy against lesser cornstalk borer.,"The invasion of peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) pods and seeds by aflatoxin-forming species of Aspergillus is linked to injury by the lesser cornstalk borer and frequently causes a severe reduction in crop quality. The lesser cornstalk borer is susceptible to the lepidopteran-active Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal crystal protein. We have introduced a codon-modified Bacillus thuringiensis cryIA(c) gene into peanut using microprojectile bombardment. The toxin-coding region of a Bt cryIA(c) gene was reconstructed for expression in plants and the resulting 3.4 kb gene cassette (promoter: 1.8 kb coding: 3') was directly cloned into the BglII site of plant transformation vectors. The vectors contained the hph gene, conferring resistance to the antibiotic hygromycin. Somatic embryos initiated from immature peanut cotyledons of two cultivars were used as the target for bombardment. DNA from hygromycin-resistant embryogenic cell lines, regenerated plants, and a progeny plant showed the presence and integration of hph and Bt genes by PCR and/or Southern blot analyses. ELISA immunoassay of the CryIA(c) protein from the hygromycin-selected plants showed the expression of CryIA(c) protein up to 0.18% of total soluble protein. Insect feeding bioassay of transformed plants indicated various levels of resistance to the lesser cornstalk borer, from complete larval mortality to a 66% reduction in larval weight. A negative correlation between percent survival or larval weight and the amount of Bt CryIA(c) protein was recorded indicating in general that the higher the protein level the lower the survival or larval weight of the insect. Based on leaf bioassay, transformation of peanut with vectors containing the Bt cryIA(c) gene may be effective in protecting the peanut plants from damage by lepidopteran insect larvae of lesser cornstalk borer.",1997,9090064,no
IgE antibody response against Aspergillus umbrosus in farmer's lung disease.,"IgG and IgA antibodies against fungus Aspergillus umbrosus have been found in the sera of patients with farmer's lung (FL) disease and healthy exposed farmers in Finland. To determine the IgE response to antigens of A. umbrosus and Candida albicans, sera from 20 patients with FL, 20 healthy farmers and 20 nonfarming controls were tested by nitrocellulose radioallergosorbent test (RAST). The values of RAST indices were low in each group and the only statistically significant difference was found between the groups of FL patients and nonfarming controls against A. umbrosus polysaccharide antigen. Individual IgE responses to polysaccharide antigens of A. umbrosus and C. albicans correlated among FL patients, however, no cross-reacting IgE antibodies could be shown. To conclude, the IgE antibody levels of A. umbrosus polysaccharide and crude antigens were low in FL patients, healthy exposed farmers and nonfarming controls. Neither polysaccharide nor crude antigen-specific IgE antibodies of A. umbrosus have any diagnostic value in FL disease.",1997,9066519,no
"Analysis of mechanisms regulating expression of the ver-1 gene, involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis.","Previous studies have shown that ver-1A encodes an enzyme which is directly involved in the conversion of versicolorin A to demethylsterigmatocystin during aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) biosynthesis in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus parasiticus. In this study, two different tools were utilized to study the regulation of ver-1A expression at the level of transcription and protein accumulation. First, a ver-1A cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli with the vector pMAL-c2. The resulting maltose-binding protein-Ver-1A fusion protein was purified and used to generate polyclonal antibodies. Western blot analyses showed that these antibodies specifically recognized the Ver-1 protein (approximately 28 kDa) in cell extracts of Aspergillus parasiticus SU1. Second, a GUS (uidA encodes beta-glucuronidase) reporter system was developed by fusing the ver-1A promoter and transcription terminator to the GUS gene. Reporter constructs were transformed into A. parasiticus, resulting in a single copy of the ver-1A-GUS reporter integrated adjacent to the wild-type ver-1A gene (3' end) in the chromosome. Western blot analysis, Northern hybridization analysis, and a GUS activity assay were used to analyze transformants. The timing of appearance and pattern of accumulation of GUS transcript and GUS protein in transformants were consistent with the timing of appearance and pattern of accumulation of ver-1 transcript and Ver-1 protein. These data suggested that the GUS gene was under the same regulatory control as the wild-type ver-1 gene and confirmed that transcriptional regulation plays an important role in ver-1A expression. Integration of the ver-1A-GUS reporter construct at the niaD locus resulted in 500-fold-lower GUS activity, but the temporal pattern of accumulation of GUS activity was not affected. Therefore, chromosomal location can play a role in determining the level of gene expression in A. parasiticus and should be an important consideration when analyzing promoter function in this organism.",1997,9055421,no
Development of polyclonal antibodies for detection of aflatoxigenic molds involving culture filtrate and chimeric proteins expressed in Escherichia coli.,"Polyclonal antibodies (PAb) were raised against an aflatoxigenic strain of Aspergillus parasiticus by using two different sources for antibody elicitation: (i) filtrate of a culture on which the fungus had been grown (ii) and two chimeric proteins, expressed in Escherichia coli as separate products, of the genes ver-1 and apa-2, which are involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis. The gene products were amplified by PCR, and each was cloned into the E. coli expression vector pGEX2T. Upon induction, the bacteria overexpressed 38- and 33-kDa chimeric proteins corresponding to the N-terminal domains of the genes ver-1 and apa-2, respectively. The chimeric proteins were isolated and affinity purified for use as antigens. The specificity of the raised antibodies was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The PAbs raised against the culture filtrate reacted with all the species of Aspergillus and Penicillium tested but not with Fusarium species or corn gain. However, the PAbs elicited against the chimeric proteins were highly specific, showing significantly higher ELISA absorbance values (A405) against A. parasiticus and A. flavus than against the other fungi tested and the corn grain. The approach of utilizing gene products associated with aflatoxin biosynthesis for antibody production therefore appears to be feasible. Such a multiantibody system combined with the PCR technique, could provide a useful tool for the rapid, sensitive, and accurate detection of aflatoxin producers present in grains and foods.",1997,9055416,no
Effect of cytomegalovirus infection status on first-year mortality rates among orthotopic liver transplant recipients. The Boston Center for Liver Transplantation CMVIG Study Group.,"To reduce the mortality rate associated with liver transplantation, it is important to identify the risk factors for increased mortality among liver transplant recipients.

Hospital epidemiologic surveillance for invasive aspergillosis: patient demographics and the utility of antigen detection.,"To monitor the epidemiology of invasive aspergillosis at a university hospital during a period of hospital construction. To compare the efficacy of active epidemiologic surveillance for invasive aspergillosis using Aspergillus cultures with the efficacy of surveillance using Aspergillus antigen detection.A prospective surveillance study.An 850-bed, tertiary-care, university-based hospital.A convenience sample of 153 patients with Aspergillus antigen testing and culture.24 cases were identified over a 12-month period 7 were nosocomial, and 17 were community-acquired. Cases occurred primarily in patients with hematologic malignancy, but also occurred in patients with solid tumor, steroid treatment, cardiac transplant, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Culture techniques identified only 14 (58%) of 24 cases, whereas Aspergillus antigen was positive in 19 (79%) of 24 cases tested. Epidemiological surveillance using either antigen or culture positivity detected 22 (92%) of 24 cases. In addition, antigen detection was 98% specific for the detection of aspergillosis, as compared to 91% for culture and 88% for antigen and culture combined.Hospital surveillance for aspergillosis should include determination of whether cases are nosocomial or community-acquired, because many may be the latter. Patients at risk for aspergillosis include patients without hematologic malignancies. Enhanced case detection occurred with active surveillance of patients considered to be at risk using both fungal serology and traditional microbiological techniques. Antigen detection was more sensitive and specific for the detection of invasive aspergillosis and may improve epidemiological surveillance for aspergillosis.",1997,9120237,no
Determination of mycotoxins in pet foods sold for domestic pets and wild birds using linked-column immunoassay clean-up and HPLC.,"A technique referred to as 'linked-column immunoassay clean-up', was developed for the simultaneous determination of aflatoxins and ochratoxin A in a range of dry cereal-based pet foods and wild bird food. In addition a method also based on clean-up using immunoaffinity columns was used for the determination of fumonisin mycotoxins in samples known or suspected to contain maize. One hundred samples of pet foods consisting of 35 samples of domestic bird seeds and 15 samples of wild bird food were examined for aflatoxins B1, B2, G1 and G2 and ochratoxin A. Twenty samples of these samples were also examined for fumonisins B1 and B2. Limits of detection were about 0.5 micrograms/kg for each aflatoxin and ochratoxin A and 3 and 8 micrograms/kg for fumonisins B1 and B2 respectively. Eighty-four percent of the samples contained no measurable concentrations of mycotoxins. A low level of aflatoxin B1 was found in a sample of cat food and a concentration of 370 micrograms/kg aflatoxin B1 in one sample of peanuts marketed for wild birds. Ochratoxin A was detected in 10% of samples but in low concentrations, the highest of 7 micrograms/kg occurring in a sample of bird food. Fumonisins were found in 30% of the 20 samples tested with a maximum of 750 micrograms/kg total fumonisins being found in a sample of cat food. Five samples each of dog and cat foods were examined for mould count and fungal species as received and after storage under controlled simulated damp conditions. Mould counts in all 10 samples examined were very low when received. The samples in which moisture content had been increased contained visible mould after storage. Penicillium, Eurotium and Aspergillus were the predominant species. However, no ochratoxin A or aflatoxins were detected in these spoiled samples.",1997,9102350,no
Identification and evaluation of a major cytotoxin of A. fumigatus.,"Aspergillus fumigatus is a highly pathogenic fungus causing a wide spectrum of diseases in immunocompromised as well as immunocompetent hosts. The present work was undertaken to evaluate the cytotoxic nature of fractionated antigens of A. fumigatus against the mammalian cell lines (J774, RAW, CHO and L929). An enriched protein antigenic fraction of A. fumigatus was subjected to con A Sepharose and phenyl Sepharose chromatography. Antigenic fractions, ConAub (conA unbound) and PSC III (fraction III of phenyl Sepharose column) containing low mw antigens showed higher cytotoxicity as compared to other antigenic fractions. PSC III was further purified on HPLC resulting in an 18 kDa homogeneous protein. The purified protein showed high ELISA absorbance values for specific IgG and IgE antibodies in sera of ABPA patients. Monoclonal antibody raised against Asp fl, a major allergen/antigen of A. fumigatus recognised the purified 18 kDa by ELISA and western blot. The 18 kDa allergen/antigen or Asp fl showed similar toxicity towards all the four cell lines (macrophage and fibroblast) with an IC50 of 75 ng/ml or 4.16 nM. Reduction in toxicity of 18 kDa at low temperatures and potentiation in presence of ammonium chloride and monensin indicates mechanism of internalisation of 18 kDa in eukaryotic cells is similar to alpha-sarcin. The present work shows that the 18 kDa allergen/antigen (Asp fl) is a major cytotoxin secreted by A. fumigatus which may play multiple roles in the pathogenesis of Aspergillosis through allergenicity, antigenicity and cytotoxicity.",1997,9059985,no
Glucoamylase gene fusions alleviate limitations for protein production in Aspergillus awamori at the transcriptional and (post) translational levels.,"In this study we have analyzed the effects of a glucoamylase gene fusion on the mRNA levels and protein levels for the human interleukin-6 gene (hil6) and the guar alpha-galactosidase gene (aglA). Previously it was shown that production of nonfused alpha-galactosidase and hIL-6 in Aspergillus awamori was limited at transcriptional and (post)translational levels, respectively (R. J. Gouka, P. J. Punt, J. G. M. Hessing, and C. A. M. J. J. van den Hondel, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 62:1951-1957, 1996). Vectors were constructed which contained either the hil6 or aglA gene fused to the Aspergillus niger glucoamylase gene (glaA) under control of the efficient 1,4-beta-endoxylanase A promoter and transcription terminator. For comparison, the vectors were integrated in a single copy at the pyrG locus of A. awamori. A glaA fusion to the 5' end of the hil6 gene resulted in a large increase in hIL-6 yield, whereas with a glaA fusion to the 3' end of the hil6 gene, almost no protein was produced. Nevertheless, the steady-state mRNA levels of both fusions were very similar and not clearly increased compared to those of a strain expressing nonfused hIL-6. Fusions of glaA to the 5' end of the wild-type guar aglA gene resulted in truncated mRNA lacking almost 900 bases (> 80%) of the aglA sequence. When the coding sequence of the wild-type aglA gene was replaced by a synthetic aglA gene with optimized Saccharomyces cerevisiae codon usage, full-length mRNA was obtained. Compared to a nonfused synthetic aglA gene, a glaA fusion with the synthetic aglA gene resulted in a 25-fold increase in the mRNA level and, as a consequence, a similar increase in the alpha-galactosidase protein level. The truncated transcripts derived from the wild-type aglA gene were further analyzed by nuclear run-on transcription assays. These experiments indicated that transcription elongation in the nucleus proceeded at least 400 bases downstream of the site where the truncation was determined, indicating that transcription elongation or premature termination was not the reason for the generation of truncated mRNAs. As the truncated mRNA also contained a poly(A) tail, truncation most likely occurs by incorrect processing of the aglA mRNA in the nucleus.",1997,9023927,no
"Heterologous expression, isolation, and characterization of versicolorin B synthase from Aspergillus parasiticus. A key enzyme in the aflatoxin B1 biosynthetic pathway.","Aflatoxin B1 is a potent environmental carcinogen produced by certain strains of Aspergillus. Central to the biosynthesis of this mycotoxin is the reaction catalyzed by versicolorin B synthase (VBS) in which a racemic substrate, versiconal hemiacetal, is cyclized to an optically active product whose absolute configuration is crucial to the interaction of aflatoxin B1 with DNA. Attempted over-production of VBS in Escherichia coli led principally to protein aggregated into inclusion bodies but also small amounts of soluble but catalytically inactive enzyme. Comparisons to wild-type VBS by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and after N-glycosidase F treatment revealed that extensive glycosylation accounted for the mass discrepancy (7,000+/-1,500 Da) between the native and bacterially expressed proteins. Several over-expression systems in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were surveyed in which one that incorporated a secretion signal was found most successful. VBS of indistinguishable mass on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and kinetic properties from the wild-type enzyme could be obtained in 50-100-fold greater amounts and whose catalytic behavior has been examined. The translated protein sequence of VBS showed three potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr) consistent with the modifications observed above and unexpectedly revealed extensive homology to the ADP-binding region prominently conserved in the glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) family of flavoenzymes. Over-production of VBS in yeast marks the first aflatoxin biosynthetic enzyme to be so obtained and opens the way to direct study of the enzymology of this complex biosynthetic pathway.",1997,8995367,no
(1-->3)-beta-D-glucan in patients with pulmonary aspergilloma.,"To elucidate the role of (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan in pulmonary aspergilloma, serum concentrations of (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan were measured repeatedly for as long as 10 months in eight patients. In four patients with inactive disease, concentrations of (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan were in the normal range.The concentrations of (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan increased in two patients, although the disease was inactive. This increase might show the earliest stage of the invasive process of the disease. In two other patients with active disease, (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan increased. Other parameters, such as galactomannan, immunodiffusion and a radio-allergosorbent test, as well as inflammatory m arkers such as C-reactive protein and the leukocyte count, did not show any consistent tendency in regard to the activity of the disease. Thus, a (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan assay may add valuable data for evaluating the disease activity and understanding the disease process of pulmonary aspergilloma.",1997,18472860,no
"Value of antigen and antibody detection, and blood evaluation parameters in diagnosis of avian invasive aspergillosis.","The applicability of ELISA detection of circulating Aspergillus spp. antigen (Ag) and systemic antibody (Ab) of IgG class, and the blood parameter values were evaluated for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in Aspergillus spp.-challenged Peking ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). The protective role of Aspergillus spp. IgG was evaluated in Cape shelducks (Tadorna cana) immunized with Aspergillus spp. Ag. Challenged but non-immunized A. platyrhynchos developed invasive aspergillosis on day 21 as demonstrated histopathologically by the presence of fungal micro-granuloma in air sacs and lung tissue, with serum antigenemia fluctuating from 65 to 270 ng of 55-kD basic protein Ag per ml. Immunized A. platyrhynchos did not demonstrate Aspergillus spp. serum antigenemia but did show rare histopathological changes in some air sacs associated with fungal inflammation. Although the differences between immunized and non-immunized T. cana in blood evaluation parameters did not differ significantly, immunized birds mounted high Aspergillus spp.-specific IgG titer. There was no correlation between the blood parameter values and post-immunization timepoints in T. cana and in A. Platyrhynchos. Intramuscular immunization with Aspergillus spp. mycelial phase cultures Ag provided protection against the pathogens. The lack of relations between blood parameter values and increasing Aspergillus spp. IgG titers (in T. cana and A. platyrhynchos) indicate low applicability of these parameters in evaluation of a bird Aspergillus spp. status. Detection of circulating 55-kDa Aspergillus spp. Ag has high early predictive values for invasive aspergillosis in birds.",1997,9691499,no
Analysis of HIV seropositive thalassemic children for antibodies specific to Aspergillus fumigatus by luminescent immunoassay.,"The applicability of luminescent immunoassay (LIA) in serodiagnosis of fungal infections in multitransfused (MT) thalassemic children seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was investigated. Thirty-one sera samples from HIV infected pediatric patients with thalassemia receiving repeated blood transfusions were analysed for the presence of antibodies specific to Aspergillus fumigatus by LIA. The LIA was standardized using well defined antigens of A. fumigatus. Ten out of 31 (32.2%) of the MT-HIV positive patients were found to have anti-Aspergillus antibodies in their sera by LIA. The ELISA could detect A. fumigatus specific antibodies in 25.8% (8 out of 31) of the patients. Thus, 20% more number of patients turned to be positive for aspergillosis by LIA as compared to ELISA. The difference was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.005). Of the MT-HIV negative patients only 1 out of 33 (3%) showed A. fumigatus specific antibodies by LIA and ELISA both. In age and sex matched control group (n = 25) none of the patients was found to be positive for antibodies to A. fumigatus. LIA was found to have better discriminatory value indicating, thereby, its utility in diagnosis of aspergillosis in compromised patients.",1997,9406054,no
[Importance of mycoses in intra-abdominal infections].,"Although there is a 20% yeast colonization in the gastrointestinal tract of the population, fungal infections appear only rarely in secondary peritonitis. The risk of severe mycosis increases after a major operation and when a patient is taking broad-spectrum antibiotics, is on total parenteral nutrition, is catheterized, and/or is immune-suppressed. In the past years the incidence of nosocomial fungal infections (usually Candida spp.) has risen significantly. Five percent of CAPD-related peritonitis is caused by fungi. In enteral anastomosis breakdown, invasive mycosis occurs more often, with an accompanying lethality of up to 80%. In severe pancreatitis, up to 5% of peripancreatic necrosis is infected with fungi. The clinical course of severe mycosis, like the septic syndrome, is associated with fungemia in up to 50% of cases. As most of the facultative pathogenic fungi are part of the physiological flora, it is difficult to interpret mycological cultures. In order to diagnose invasive fungal infections, histopathological techniques and serologic tests for antigens and antibodies are available. Three antifungal agents (amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole) are available for intravenous administration. Amphotericin B is given at doses of up to 1 mg/kg per day, in liposomal galenism up to 3 mg/kg per day. Combining amphotericin B with flucytosine (150-200 mg/kg per day) a synergistic effect is reached. Fluconazole at a dosage of 200-800 mg per day represents an alternative with similar antifungal activity and lower side effects.",1997,9333708,no
The structures of polysaccharides and glycolipids of Aspergillus fumigatus grown in the presence of human serum.,"A study was made of polysaccharides and glycosphingolipids isolated from Aspergillus fumigatus grown in media supplemented with human serum from healthy donors. Fractionation of Cetavlon-precipitated polysaccharides on Sephacryl S-400 gave rise to an excluded fraction (Fraction I) with molecular weight of > 400 kDa and an included peak (Fraction II) with an average molecular weight of 30-80 kDa. Fraction I comprises about 5% of total polysaccharide and was identified as a glycogen-like molecule. Its structure was deduced from methylation data, treatment with amyloglucosidase, a red-brown coloration produced with an iodine solution and by 1H and 13C-NMR spectroscopy. It was previously suggested that higher amounts of glycogen-like polysaccharide (20%) were present in A. fumigatus grown in serum-free medium. Fraction II was identified as a galactomannan and was the main polysaccharide of A. fumigatus grown in serum-free medium. Fraction II was identified as a galactomannan and was the main 13C-NMR spectroscopy combined with partial acetolysis and methylation analysis. The 13C-NMR spectrum of the galactomannan showed a much greater complexity in the beta-D-gal f and alpha-D-man p C-1 regions, than was evident for galactomannan from serum-free cultures previously described, reflecting differences in the glycosylation pattern, stimulated in serum-supplemented medium. No differences in A. fumigatus glycosphingolipid could be detected between serum-containing and serum-free growth conditions. Our results demonstrate that the change in polysaccharide structure is a more specific response to the altered growth conditions and not merely a symptom of more general changes.",1997,9299754,no
Immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibody against Candida albicans mannan antigen demonstrates cutaneous Candida granulomas as evidence of Candida sepsis in an immunosuppressed host.,"We report the occurrence of invasive Candida albicans infection with disseminated cutaneous Candida granulomas in a patient with aplastic anaemia after viral hepatitis. Fungal elements in a skin biopsy specimen were detected by PAS stain and identified as Candida sp. by immunohistochemistry directed against the C. albicans mannan surface antigen. Based on rapid diagnosis of Candida granuloma and by Candida-positive cultures of blood and swabs, systemic treatment with liposomal amphotericin B led to survival of the patient.",1997,9187854,no
Acute cerebellopathy as a probable toxic effect of flucytosine.,"Cryptococcosis is the commonest fungal infection of the CNS and it is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in immunodeficient patients [1]. It has been occasionally described in immunocompetent patients [2]. We report a patient with no predisposing factors who was treated with flucytosine and amphotericin B for cryptococcal meningitis. Following treatment, she developed a reversible acute cerebellar syndrome that was probably secondary to the administration of flucytosine, an adverse effect that has not previously been described [3, 4]. An 87-year old women with no relevant personal or family history was admitted to the hospital for headache, fever, and confusion over the past week. The vital signs, general and neurological examination were normal. In laboratory tests, the urine, urea nitrogen, glucose, bilirubin, electrolytes, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, alkaline phosphatase, haematocrit, white-cell count, and platelet were also normal. A lumbar puncture was performed which showed: 60 typical lymphocytes per ml, adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity 6 U.l-1 (normal under 4 U.l-1), proteins 75.7 mg.dl-1, and glucose 13 mg.dl-1 with a glycaemia of 120 mg.dl-1. The microbiology study showed staining and a positive culture for Cryptococcus neoformans, and an antigen titre of 1/2080. The serology for HIV infection was negative, and other predisposing factors for this fungal infection, such as immunological defects, a lymphoreticular malignancy and sarcoidosis were excluded. A CT scan of the cranial-thoracic-abdominal regions was normal and tumour markers were absent.",1997,9112068,no
The use of immunohistochemistry to improve sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of systemic mycoses in patients with haematological malignancies.,"The original histomorphological diagnoses in a series of 34 mycotic lesions from 23 patients with haematological malignancies were re-evaluated by immunohistochemistry. A panel of antibodies was used to identify the agents of aspergillosis, candidosis, fusariosis, scedosporiosis (pseudallescheriosis), and zygomycosis. Apart from improving the diagnosis of aspergillosis, candidosis, and zygomycosis, the application of immunohistochemistry also disclosed three lesions of aspergillosis which had been overlooked during the original screening. It is concluded that the use of immunohistochemistry for the diagnosis of common opportunistic mycoses will not only increase diagnostic specificity, but will also reveal more tissue infections than the conventional histomorphological examination of traditionally stained sections.",1997,9072010,no
Plasma (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan assay and immunohistochemical staining of (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan in the fungal cell walls using a novel horseshoe crab protein (T-GBP) that specifically binds to (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan.,"A highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific to (1-->3)-beta-D-glucans (GBP-ELISA) has been developed using a novel (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan-binding protein (T-GBP), which was purified from the amebocyte lysate of the Japanese horseshoe crab, Tachypleus tridentatus. This method allowed quantitation of the glucans in a concentration range of 0.1-1,000 ng/ml, regardless of linear and branched structures, and was applied to determine the amounts of (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan in human and animal plasmas for diagnosis of fungemia. High levels of plasma glucan contents in clinical samples were found to be correlated closely with the severity of fungal infection. T-GBP was successfully utilized for indirect immunofluorescence staining of (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan in Candida albicans cell walls.",1997,9058244,no
Fine-needle aspiration biopsy in fungal infections.,"To evaluate the role of fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) in diagnosis of fungal infections, a retrospective analysis of 26 cases of fungal infection is described. The spectrum of various fungi encountered on cytologic microscopy of aspirated material and fungal culture was as follows: Aspergillus sp (16 cases), Cryptococcus neoformans (six cases), Mucorales (one case), Candida sp (one case), Phialophora parasiticus (one case), Sporothrix schenkii and Cladosporium sp (the last two isolated from a single case). In majority (71%) of cases, fungal infection was not clinically suspected but was picked up on cytologic material in all the cases. An accurate diagnosis based on morphology could be made in 21 cases (80%). Predisposing factor was found in three patients, two of them had diabetes mellitus and one was on immunosuppression. HIV serology was negative in seven cases tested. Commonest tissue reaction (75%) was foreign body giant cells with foamy macrophages and variable amount of necrosis. Although FNAB is helpful in the rapid diagnosis of fungal infections, culture is essential for more accurate identification.",1997,9034733,no
Specificity of a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detecting Aspergillus galactomannan.,"The specificity of a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting Aspergillus galactomannan was tested with exoantigens of 29 fungi cultured from clinical specimens. Cross-reactivity was observed with Penicillium chrysogenum, Penicillium digitatum, and Paecilomyces variotii. Furthermore, 40 serum samples obtained from bacteremic patients with hematologic malignancies were retrospectively tested by sandwich ELISA. False-positive reactions with the serum were reproducible but did not correspond with the results of culture of specific microorganisms. Moreover, the microorganisms cultured from the blood showed no reactivity by the sandwich ELISA.",1997,8968919,no
Detection of galactomannan and complement activation in the pregnant mouse during experimental systemic aspergillosis.,"Foeto-placental infections are obtained when pregnant mice are challenged intravenously with conidial suspensions of Aspergillus fumigatus. This experimental model, which is used without any immuno-suppressive pretreatment, can be employed to screen for differences in foeto-placental infectivity of A. fumigatus strains when the number of colony-forming units (CFUs) in conidial suspensions used for infection is from 1 x 10(5) to 1 x 10(6). In the foeto-placental unit, hyphal growth was initiated at the periphery of the placental disc from which infection spread to the central parts of the placenta, the extrafoetal membranes and the foetus. Complement activation was noticed as a consequence of pregnancy and conidial inoculation, but was neither dose-dependent nor related to the extent of infection. Galactomannan was present in the plasma of infected mice and, in contrast to the situation in bovine placental aspergillosis, can be used as a good marker of foeto-placental aspergillosis.",1996,9048873,no
Infective dyspepsia in a heart transplant recipient.,"We report the coexistence of symptomatic viral, bacterial, and fungal infection of the upper gastrointestinal tract in a heart transplant recipient.

Automated specific IgE assay with recombinant allergens: evaluation of the recombinant Aspergillus fumigatus allergen I in the Pharmacia Cap System.,"We report the results of a study comparing the recombinant Aspergillus fumigatus allergen 1 (rAsp f I) to commercial A. fumigatus extracts in serological assays. Pharmacia CAP System and skin tests.The study was designed to test the feasibility of using recombinant allergens in an automated serology system for determination of allergen-specific IgE.Patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), asthmatics with A. fumigatus allergy and control subjects, who included allergic asthmatics without allergy to A. fumigatus and healthy subjects, were investigated. All subjects were characterized with respect to their total IgE level, radio allergosorbent test to A. fumigatus and skin test reactivity to both commercial A. fumigatus extracts and recombinant rAsp f I protein.All patients with ABPA (n = 30) showed positive skin test reactions with commercial A. fumigatus extracts, and 24 were sensitized to rAsp f I by the same criterion. The 10 patients with asthma and A. fumigatus allergy showed positive skin reactions to at least one commercial extract, and five reacted to rAsp f I. All control subjects (n = 19) scored negatively in skin tests to A. fumigatus extracts and rAsp f I and showed no detectable rAsp f I-specific IgE. ImmunoCAP carrying immobilized rAsp f I were evaluated using sera from all individuals described and the results compared with those obtained with the rAsp f I-specific ELISA for IgE. The data obtained with the two rAsp f I-specific detection systems correlated closely (r = 0.997) and were in perfect agreement with the skin test results.The data show that rAsp f I can be used as immobilized allergen in the Pharmacia CAP System indicating the feasibility of using recombinant allergens for an automated serological diagnosis of allergic diseases. However, every recombinant allergen needs to be evaluated individually for its performance if applied to a new diagnostic technology.",1996,9027442,no
Expression of human recombinant beta 2-microglobulin by Aspergillus nidulans and its activity.,"The light chain of HLA class I protein (beta 2m) has been expressed in Aspergillus nidulans. The cDNA of beta 2m was modified using the polymerase chain reaction to include overlapping extensions for its subsequent fusion into an Aspergillus vector. This fusion resulted in beta 2m cDNA being flanked by the Aspergillus awamori glucoamylase promoter and the Aspergillus niger glucoamylase terminator. Expression of beta 2m was induced by the addition of starch to the culture medium. In preliminary mass culture trials, 177 micrograms/liter of f beta 2m were obtained in 60-liter fermentations. N-terminal sequencing of purified human beta 2m produced in fungi (f beta 2m) revealed that 28% of the purified protein was of proper sequence and 61% of the protein had an additional serine and lysine residue derived from the C-terminus of the fungal leader. Purified f beta 2m from culture supernatants appeared biochemically similar to beta 2m obtained from human urine (u beta 2m) as seen in immunoblot analysis. Functionally, f beta 2m effectively interacted as a subunit of class I MHC molecules. This was seen both in a sandwich ELISA for detecting properly folded HLA class I heavy chain and in assays showing cell-surface beta 2m exchange into the mouse class I MHC H-2Kd. In these experiments the biological activity of f beta 2m was indistinguishable from u beta 2m. The successful expression of biologically active beta 2m in A. nidulans suggests that fungal systems might be useful for the production of other active components of the HLA class I MHC complex.",1996,8960907,no
Ochratoxin production by Aspergillus species.,"Ochratoxin production was tested in 172 strains representing species in sections Fumigati, Circumdati, Candidi, and Wentii of the genus Aspergillus by an immunochemical method using a monoclonal antibody preparation against ochratoxin A. Ochratoxin A was detected in Aspergillus ochraceus, A. alliaceus, A. sclerotiorum, A. sulphureus, A. albertensis, A. auricomus, and A. wentii strains. This is the first report of production of ochratoxins in the latter three species. Ochratoxin production by these species was confirmed by high-performance thin-layer chromatography and by high-performance liquid chromatography. The chemical methods also indicated the production of ochratoxin B by all of the Aspergillus strains mentioned above.",1996,8953717,no
Specific antibody detection in human aspergillosis: a GEMO* multicentre evaluation of a rapid immunoelectrophoresis method (Paragon). Group d'Etude des Mycoses Opportunistes.,"A new immunoelectrophoresis system, the Paragon system, was evaluated in three different hospital centres with the aim of improving standardization of the serodiagnosis of human aspergillosis. To select the most efficient antigen, various commercial and home-made antigens were first tested on 19 sera from 19 patients with highly probable aspergillosis. The value measured using the Paragon anti-Aspergillus antibody detection system was then compared with the results obtained by conventional serological diagnostic methods (conventional immunoelectrophoresis, enzyme linked-immunosorbent assay, indirect immunofluorescence): this step was performed using the first 19 sera as well as 16 other sera from 13 patients with suspected aspergillosis. Concordant results were obtained in 28 cases. The discrepancies observed with seven sera were probably related to differences in the nature of the antigens. Paragon immunoelectrophoresis proved to be a practicable technique requiring only a small amount of serum and giving results within a shorter time than competitive methods (24-48 h). Its major drawbacks compared with conventional immunoelectrophoresis are some difficulties in reading, fewer precipitin lines and the relatively high cost of routine analysis.",1996,9144998,no
Dexamethasone and cyclosporin A modulation of cytokine expression and specific antibody synthesis in an allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis murine model.,"We previously demonstrated that, in C57B1/6 mice, cyclosporin A enhanced and dexamethasone inhibited the Aspergillus fumigatus-induced pulmonary eosinophilia and total IgE levels. To evaluate whether these effects were related to the modulation of T-lymphocyte recruitment and activation and cytokine expression, we performed immunohistochemical staining for T-cell surface marker CD3 and CD4, cell activation marker CD25, and cytokines granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-5 (IL-5) on lung tissue sections from mice exposed to Aspergillus fumigatus and treated or not with dexamethasone or cyclosporin A. Dexamethasone significantly inhibited Aspergillus fumigatus-induced increased number of activated T cells and cytokine-expressing cells in parallel with a decrease in pulmonary eosinophils. In contrast, cyclosporin A did not decrease these immunological events but enhanced the lung eosinophil recruitment. Moreover, dexamethasone prevented the production of immunoglobulins against 76 and 36 kD antigen proteins and cyclosporin A against 76 and 18 kD antigen proteins. These results indicate that dexamethasone down-regulates and cyclosporin A up-regulates lung eosinophil recruitment and total IgE production, probably via the modulation of T-lymphocyte activation and GM-CSF, IL-4 and IL-5 expression. Both drugs inhibit Aspergillus fumigatus-specific antibody synthesis, but their suppressive actions are selective to different antigenic components.",1996,8957199,no
The effects of fungal competition on colonization of barley grain by Fusarium sporotrichioides on T-2 toxin formation.,"Colonization of barley grain by Fusarium sporotrichioides and T-2 toxin formation in the presence of Aspergillus flavus, Penicillium verrucosum, and Hyphopichia burtonii were studied at 20 and 30 degrees C and at 0.97, 0.95 or 0.90 aw during 3 weeks' incubation. Colonization of grain was assessed from frequency of seed infection and numbers of colony forming units (cfu) produced and by observation of hyphal extension on the grain surface from germinating spores while concentrations of T-2 toxin were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using monoclonal antibodies. Germination of F. sporotrichioides spores was unaffected by the presence of other species under all conditions. However, subsequent colonization of barley grain by F. sporotrichioides was either completely inhibited or markedly decreased by the the presence of other fungi irrespective of the aw, temperature or competing species involved. T-2 toxin production occurred only at 20 degrees C and 0.97 or 0.95 aw, and mostly within the first 7 days: production of T-2 toxin by F. sporotrichioides was significantly greater in the presence of A. flavus and P. verrucosum throughout the 3-week incubation period under most conditions. T-2 toxin production was only slightly decreased by the presence of H. burtonii, despite the apparent lack of growth of F. sporotrichioides.",1996,8950114,no
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis in workers exposed to esparto grass (Stipa tenacissima) fibers.,"Esparto grass (Stipa tenacissima), which is commonly found in the Mediterranean countries, has a wide variety of uses. Five stucco makers who had cough, dyspnea, malaise, and fever after exposure to esparto fiber used in their jobs showed a significant decrease in symptoms when they were away from work. Precipitating antibodies against an esparto extract were found in the sera of all patients. Specific IgG antibodies against the esparto extract were also demonstrated in all patient sera, as were IgG antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus and thermophilic microorganisms (Micropolyspora faeni and Thermoactinomyces vulgaris) by means of an ELISA method. Esparto activity was inhibited in different ranges by the above antigens by inhibition ELISA. Only A. fumigatus could be identified after microbiologic evaluation of the esparto fiber samples. After inhalation challenge tests were performed with esparto extracts, all patients showed significant decreases in forced vital capacity, transfer lung CO, and PaO2 blood gas from baseline values. Fever, chills, malaise, dry cough, tachycardia, tachypnea, and rales on chest auscultation were also observed in all patients. Findings from bronchoalveolar lavage were suggestive of allergic alveolitis. Transbronchial biopsy specimens showed interstitial alveolitis with lymphocyte-macrophage infiltrate and granuloma. Unexposed control subjects did not exhibit reactivity to any of the tests listed above. The dust derived from esparto fibers can cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis in exposed subjects. Organisms such as A. fumigatus and thermophilic actinomyces could be the causative antigens. ""Stipatosis"" might be an appropriate name for this disorder.",1996,8939163,no
Identification of regulatory mutants of Aspergillus aculeatus affected in rhamnogalacturonan hydrolase expression.,"Rhamnogalacturonan hydrolase expression in A. aculeatus can be induced by pectin, but also by a combination of two constituent monosaccharides of pectin, rhamnose and galacturonic acid. The rhgA promoter was fused to the A. niger glucose oxidase coding sequence and a single copy of the hybrid gene was integrated at the rhgA locus in the genome of A. aculeatus. The gene product was subsequently used as reporter in a screening assay for the selection of rhamnogalacturonan hydrolase-overproducing mutant strains. At least four of the mutations were recessive and could be assigned to different loci. One mutation (rgr25) showed linkage with the rhgA locus. Inducible rhamnogalacturonan hydrolase expression levels of about 5-10 times that in the wild-type were found in the mutants rgr48, rgr25 and rgr34 after growth on a combination of rhamnose and galacturonic acid with or without fructose as a carbon source. In mutant rgr48 elevated levels of rhgA transcription were found.",1996,8929397,no
Community-acquired pneumonia in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a Spanish multicenter study.,"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is an infectious illness that frequently motivates hospital admission when comorbid conditions are present. However, the epidemiology of CAP in relation to the underlying disease of the patients is not well known. We performed a prospective multicenter study with the aim of assessing the clinical characteristics, etiology, and outcome of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with CAP. Between October 1992 and December 1994 we studied 124 COPD patients (mean FEV1 40 +/- 11% of predicted, mean FVC/FEV1 49 +/- 10) admitted because of CAP to one of the participating centers. An attempt to obtain an etiologic diagnosis was performed by means of blood cultures (n = 123), sputum cultures (n = 97), pleural fluid cultures (n = 17), protected specimen brush samples (n = 41), percutaneous transthoracic needle aspiration (n = 41), and serology (n = 106). Etiologic diagnosis was achieved in 80 (64%) of cases, however, diagnosis based upon valid techniques was only possible in 73 (59%) cases. The main causal microorganisms were the following: Streptococcus pneumoniae in 32 (43%), Chlamydia pneumoniae in 9 (12%), Hemophilus influenzae in 7 (9%), Legionella pneumophila in 7 (9%), Streptococcus viridans in 3 (4%), Coxiella burnetii in 3 (4%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 2 (3%), Nocordia asteroides 2, Aspergillus ssp. 1, and others 10. In three of these cases the etiology was polymicrobial. Bacteremia was present in 19 (15%) cases S. pneumoniae was the most frequent isolate (13 cases). Antibiotic treatment was modified in 22 cases due to etiologic findings, and in 9 due to therapeutic failure. Ten patients died (8%), and 22 needed mechanical ventilation, the mortality rate in the latter population being 23%. Total or partial resistance of S. pneumoniae to penicillin was observed in 10 of 32 (31%) isolations, and to erythromycin in 2 (6%). The results of this study are important for the standardization of empiric antibiotic strategies in COPD patients with pneumonia.",1996,8912764,no
Expression of ICAM-1 and TNF alpha in human alveolar macrophages from lung-transplant recipients.,"Local activation of macrophages may play an important role in the immune process of pulmonary infections and in the inflammatory response of lung allograft rejection. To document macrophage activation within human lung allografts displaying various complications, we have investigated ICAM-1 expression in freshly isolated alveolar macrophages (AM) from lung-transplant recipients by immunocytofluorimetric analysis, and rIFN gamma induced in vitro by ELISA. A total of 21 bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BAL) from 13 transplanted patients displaying no complication, acute rejection, bacterial/fungal infection, or CMV infection entered the study. ICAM-1 was expressed at a higher level in rejecting patients. Surprisingly, TNF alpha release from AM upon in vitro activation was significantly decreased during rejection. Furthermore, we have studied the effects of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone, the key drug for the treatment of allograft rejection, on the expression of ICAM-1 and TNF alpha induced in vitro in AM, at the levels of protein production and of transcription. Whereas dexamethasone did not influence ICAM-1 expression in AM, it downregulated TNF alpha production at least in part at the transcriptional level. Our results suggest strongly that the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids are not related to ICAM-1 modulation on human AM but to the downregulation of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF alpha that is produced early in the inflammatory process. Moreover, our model of human AM activation induced in vitro by rIFN gamma appears a useful tool for in vitro investigation of the cellular and molecular targets of anti-inflammatory drugs for a more appropriate use.",1996,8906220,no
Aspergillus flavus colonization and aflatoxin B(1) formation in barley grain during interaction with other fungi.,"Colonization of barley grain by Aspergillus flavus and formation of aflatoxin B(1) in the presence of Penicillium verrucosum, Fusarium sporotrichioides, and Hyphopichia burtonii were studied over a three-week period in all combinations of 20 or 30 °C and 0.97, 0.95 or 0.90 a(w). Grain colonization was assessed initially by observing hyphal extension on the grain surface, using scanning electron microscopy, and then from the proportion of seeds infected and numbers of colony forming units (cfu) formed. Aflatoxin b(1) concentrations were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay using a monoclonal antibody. These studies showed that interaction between A. flavus and other fungi in paired culture had different effects on both colonization and aflatoxin formation depending on the species involved and environmental conditions. Germination of A. flavus spores was unaffected by the presence of other species on the grain surface. Subsequently, three principal patterns of A. flavus colonization of barley grain were observed through the incubation period in the presence of other fungal species: (a) colonization unaffected by the presence of other species (b) colonization initially slower in the presence of other species but later differing little from pure cultures",1996,20882457,no
Immunoperoxidase staining for identification of Aspergillus species in routinely processed tissue sections.,"To evaluate the performance of an immunoperoxidase stain using the monoclonal antibody EB-A1 to detect Aspergillus species in formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded tissue.The monoclonal antibody EB-A1 directed against galactomannan was used to detect Aspergillus species in 23 patients with suspected or confirmed invasive aspergillosis. Immunostaining was performed on formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded tissue using the streptavidin-biotin method and compared with conventional haematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, and Gomori-Grocott stains. Results of immunostaining were semiquantitatively analysed with regard to both intensity of staining and number of positively staining micro-organisms. Tissue sections from 16 patients with confirmed invasive mycoses due to Candida species, Apophysomyces elegans, Rhizopus oryzae, Pseudallescheria boydii and Histoplasma capsulatum were used as controls.In 19 (83%) of 23 cases invasive aspergillosis was confirmed by both histological examination and culture (18 Aspergillus fumigatus and one A flavus). Immunoperoxidase stains were positive in 17 (89%) of 19 cases including one case of disseminated infection due to A flavus. Furthermore, the immunoperoxidase stain was positive in a culture negative tissue section with histological evidence of mycelial development, indicating the presence of Aspergillus species. Some cross-reactivity was observed with the highly related fungus P boydii, although the number of mycelial elements that stained was low.Immunoperoxidase staining using the monoclonal antibody EB-A1 performs well on routinely processed tissue sections and permits detection and generic identification of Aspergillus species, although it was no better than conventional histopathology in identifying the presence of an infection. An additional advantage is that the immunostain may help to provide an aetiological diagnosis when cultures remain negative.",1996,8943743,no
PCR detection of DNA specific for Aspergillus species in serum of patients with invasive aspergillosis.,"We investigated the possible presence of DNA specific for Aspergillus species in serum samples of patients with invasive aspergillosis (IA) by the nested PCR method. Fourteen strains of fungi including 5 strains of Aspergillus species and 10 strains of common bacteria were used for examination of specificity and sensitivity of the nested PCR. Two sets of oligonucleotide primers were derived from the sequence of the variable regions V7 to V9 of the 18S rRNA genes of Aspergillus fumigatus. The specific fragment was amplified from five strains of Aspergillus species in the single and nested PCR but not from other microorganisms. Target DNA was detected by the nested PCR with as little as 50 fg of the extracted DNA of A. fumigatus. We investigated the detection of DNA specific for Aspergillus species in serum samples of a murine model of aspergillosis and 20 patients with IA. The specific fragment was detected by the nested PCR in 71% of serum samples of infected mice and 70% of serum samples of patients with IA, while galactomannan antigen was detected in 43 and 60% of samples, respectively. The high sensitivity and specificity of the nested PCR indicate that the assay can provide early diagnosis with sufficient accuracy to be clinically useful for immunocompromised patients with IA.",1996,8880501,no
Aspergillomas of the sphenoid sinus: a series of 10 cases treated by endoscopic sinus surgery.,"We report our experience with 10 cases of sphenoidal aspergillomas treated by endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). Chronic symptoms such as cough, post-nasal discharge, dysphonia and even facial pain can be encountered in the history. Computerised tomography and, occasionally, magnetic resonance imaging are of great help in the assessment of this disease, especially when extensive skull base involvement is present. The radiological presentation can vary from an heterogeneous to homogeneous opacity with or without bone lysis to a frank pseudotumoural appearance. Four diagnostic tools have been evaluated to confirm the diagnosis: histology, direct smear, fungal cultures, and serology for Aspergillus. ESS has been successfully carried out without morbidity in all cases. No recurrence of the disease is seen after a mean follow-up of 27 months.",1996,8938890,no
Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in patients with chromomycosis.,"Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are a family of antibodies that react to proteins within neutrophil granules and monocyte lysosomes, and occur prominently in sera from patients with systemic necrotizing vasculitis. The cytoplasmic staining pattern (c-ANCA) is very sensitive and specific for Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), and most commonly results from reactivity with proteinase 3 (PR3). The features of tissue damage in the fungal infection chromomycosis, in particular polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) infiltration and granuloma formation, bear a resemblance to that seen in WG.We tested sera from 25 patients with clinical and histologic diagnosis of chromomycosis for the presence of ANCA by indirect immunofluorescence. These same sera were analyzed for reactivity to neutrophil primary granule extracts and PR3 by ELISA.Five of the 25 patients (20%) had detectable c-ANCA, without central accentuation, at serum dilutions of at least 1:40. Three of these 5 ANCA-positive patients reacted with neutrophil primary granule extracts by ELISA however, none of them reacted with PR3.These results demonstrate that fungal infection should be included among the conditions, unrelated to necrotizing vasculitis, that can trigger autoreactivity against myeloid lysosomal antigens.",1996,8913648,no
[Serodiagnosis of fungal infection].,"Serum samples from patients with candidiasis were assayed for Candida mannan by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using anti-Candida albicans and anti-Candida krusei antibodies (ELISA, n = 81), for heat-labile glycoprotein by the latex agglutination test (Cand-Tec, n = 69), for D-arabinitol by the enzymatic fluorometric method, and for beta-D-glucan by the chromogenic substrate method (the G test, n = 14). The sensitivities and the specificities were 83% and 99% for mannan, 61% and 85% for heat-labile glycoprotein, 50% and 91% for D-arabinitol/creatinine ratio (> or = 1.5 mumol/mg), and 100% and 71% for beta-D-glucan (> or = 30 pg/ml), respectively. No positive reactions for the Cand-Tec and the ELISA were observed in patients with candidiasis by Candida glabrata. The sensitivity of the Cand-Tec increased with the number of samples available per patient, which was lower for patients with hematological malignancies compared with patients without hematological malignancies (25% vs. 59%). For the ELISA, however, the sensitivity was not related to the presence of hematological malignancies, nor was it related to the number of samples per patient. Among the serodiagnostic methods examined, the ELISA may be most useful in diagnosing candidiasis and in predicting the prognosis of candidiasis caused by medically important Candida strains. Of 21 patients with aspergillosis, 19 patients had antigenemia detected by the ELISA, and only 5 patients showed positive reactions with the LA test(Sanofi Diagnostics). Five of six patients with cryptococcosis revealed positive reactions with both the ELISA and the LA test(Eiken).",1996,8911065,no
Domestic fungal viable propagules and sensitization in children with IgE mediated allergic diseases.,"In order to study the possible relationship between domestic fungal exposure and sensitization to fungi, the homes of 20 children with allergic diseases (mainly bronchial asthma) were inspected for visible fungal growth and airborne viable fungal propagules were sampled. Inclusion criterion was sensitization to at least one of the tested fungi as shown by proof of specific IgE in serum. Twelve of 19 homes (63%) revealed a considerable amount of viable fungal propagules and/or visible fungal growth. Penicillium, Cladosporium, Aspergillus, Mycelia sterilia and yeasts were most prevalent. There was no clear-cut relationship to serologically proven sensitization.",1996,9116880,no
"Enolase antigen, mannan antigen, Cand-Tec antigen, and beta-glucan in patients with candidemia.","We compared the specificities and sensitivities of four tests used for the serodiagnosis of candidemia in 39 patients with candidemia, including 10 patients with superficial Candida colonization, 10 patients with deep mycosis, and 20 healthy subjects. The results obtained by the dot immunoblotting assay for detecting the enolase antigen (48 kDa) were compared with those of assays for detecting mannan antigen, heat-labile antigen (a threshold titer of four times), and beta-glucan (> or = 60 pg/ml). Enolase antigen was detected in 28 (71.8%) patients with candidemia, while 30 (76.9%), 10 (25.6%), and 27 (84.4%) patients were positive for the heat-labile antigen by the Cand-Tec assay, the mannan antigen by the Pastorex Candida assay, and beta-glucan by the limulus test, respectively. Ten patients with superficial Candida colonization, 5 patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, 5 patients with cryptococcosis, and 20 healthy subjects were negative for both enolase antigen and mannan antigen. Two patients with superficial Candida colonization, one patient with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, and two patients with cryptococcosis were positive by the Cand-Tec assay. The beta-glucan concentration was more than 60 pg/ml in all patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis however, it was less than 10 pg/ml in all patients with cryptococcosis. The specificity of enolase antigen in the serodiagnosis of candidemia was 100%, but the sensitivity was 71.8%. The specificity and sensitivity of Cand-Tec, the assay for mannan antigen, and the assay for beta-glucan were 76.9 and 87.5%, 25.6 and 100%, and 84.4 and 87.5%, respectively. Our results demonstrated that antigen detection tests are useful for the diagnosis of candidemia",1996,8818881,no
Serodiagnosis and monitoring of Aspergillus infections after lung transplantation.,"To determine whether quantification of specific antifungal antibody responses in serum can provide supplemental information for the diagnosis of Aspergillus fumigatus infections and the monitoring of antifungal treatment in patients after lung transplantation.Retrospective study.Center for lung transplantation, University Hospital Groningen, the Netherlands.4 patients with proven A. fumigatus infections after lung transplantation and fatal outcome.The IgG antibody response specific for A. fumigatus antigens was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and was compared with radiographic features, cytologic findings, microbiological cultures, and clinical diagnosis.Increasing IgG antibody responses specific for A. fumigatus antigens closely paralleled cytologic or microbiological identification of A. fumigatus from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and decrease of lung function. Increasing specific IgG antibody responses were found to precede radiographic identification of lung cavitation by 1 to 2 weeks, precede the diagnosis of aspergillosis by 2 to 20 weeks, and detect fungal reinfection. In most cases, successful antifungal treatment decreased specific IgG antibody response. A decrease in specific IgG antibody response correlated with the inability to culture or identify A. fumigatus in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and with radiographic and clinical improvement.Specific IgG antibody responses in serum correlate with radiographic, cytologic, and microbiological findings and with the clinical diagnosis of A. fumigatus infections in patients who have had lung transplantation. Increased IgG antibody responses in serum may provide important information that is helpful in the diagnosis and early treatment of pulmonary fungal infections and in monitoring antifungal treatment.",1996,8686977,no
The effect of pre- and pro-sequences and multicopy integration on heterologous expression of the Fusarium solani pisi cutinase gene in Aspergillus awamori.,"A synthetic derivative of the cutinase cDNA of Fusarium solani pisi was expressed in Aspergillus awamori using the A. awamori endoxylanase II (exlA) promoter and terminator. The influence of the origin of the pre-sequence and the presence of a pro-sequence on the efficiency of extracellular cutinase production was analysed in single-copy transformants containing an expression cassette integrated at the pyrG locus. Transformants containing a construct encoding a direct, inframe fusion of the xylanase pre-peptide to the mature cutinase showed a 2-fold higher cutinase production level compared to strains containing constructs with an additional cutinase pro-peptide. The effect of multicopy integration of the expression cassette on cutinase production was analysed in strains with different numbers of a cutinase construct containing its own pre-pro-sequence. The multicopy strains showed a 6-to 12-fold increased production of extracellular cutinase relative to the single-copy strains. No linear dose response relation to the number of expression cassettes present in the strains was observed. The amount of active enzyme produced by the strains correlated with the amount of cutinase-specific mRNA, suggesting that cutinase overproduction is not limited at the level of translation or secretion.",1996,8987467,no
A model for the prediction of relative titres of avian malaria and Aspergillus spp. IgG in Jackass penguin (Spheniscus demersus) females based on maternal IgG in egg-yolk.,"A model for the prediction of IgG titres in females of the Jackass penguin (Spheniscus demersus) was developed, based on IgG which was maternally transmitted to the yolk of unembryonated eggs produced by these females. However, prediction of the female titre based on the titre of embryonated eggs may be inadequate. Blood samples from 10 S. demersus females and their corresponding embryonated (n = 10) and unembryonated (n = 49) eggs were analysed by indirect ELISA for avian malaria (Plasmodium relictum, P. elongatum) IgG and Aspergillus spp. IgG. There was no correlation between humoral responses to avian malaria and Aspergillus spp. in females or in their eggs. Avian malaria and Aspergillus spp. titres were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the eggs than in the corresponding females and were significantly correlated (P < 0.01) with the blood titres, r = 0.84, r = 0.89, respectively. No correlation was found between titres of embryo yolk-sac (embryonated eggs) and the blood of their female parent however, the embryo blood and the corresponding female titres were significantly (P < 0.05) correlated (avian malaria, r = 0.74",1996,8894766,no
Association between incidence of Aspergillus antigenemia and exposure to construction works at a hospital site.,"During the course of extensive building activity in the vicinity of bone marrow transplantation wards, the patients were routinely screened for the occurrence of Aspergillus galactomannan antigen in serum. In 19 (6.7%) out of 285 patients, an antigenemia was detected. Eleven (58%) of the 19 antigenemic patients suffered from autopsy-proven or clinically suspected invasive aspergillosis. The yearly incidence of antigenemic patients differed significantly, ranging from 0% in the year without building activities to 20.9% in the year with major activities, particularly interior completion works and landscaping. It is concluded that Aspergillus antigen monitoring of bone marrow transplant recipients has a limited value for the diagnosis of manifest invasive aspergillosis. However, it it epidemiologically useful to assess the extent of intensive contact with aspergilli and to control the effectivity of preventive measures.",1996,8837377,no
Improved diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis with gp66 (formerly antigen 7) of Aspergillus fumigatus for specific IgE detection.,"In cystic fibrosis (CF) serologic tests assume increased significance for discriminating the symptoms of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) from those of bacterial infections. Elevated specific IgE is a sensitive indicator of ABPA, but the high prevalence of patients with CF who have simple allergy to Aspergillus fumigatus means that it lacks specificity.The aim of this study was to develop an assay to detect IgE to a single allergenic protein of A. fumigatus to increase the discrimination between ABPA and uncomplicated A. fumigatus allergy.to identify a more selective allergen, serum samples from nine patients with ABPA and five patients with allergy were used to screen A. fumigatus proteins for allergenic activity by crossed radioimmunoelectrophoresis. Molecular weights were determined by electrophoresis and immunoblotting, and carbohydrate content was analyzed by concanavalin A chromatography and endoglycosidase digestion.The allergen identified was found to be a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 66 kd, referred to as gp66. An ELISA was developed to measure specific IgE to gp66, and the efficacy was compared with IgE detection by using the unfractionated A. fumigatus extract on serum samples from 14 patients with CF and ABPA, 42 patients with CF and allergy but not ABPA, and 23 patients with CF without ABPA or allergy.Use of gp66 increased the specificity of IgE analysis from 58.5% to 78.5%, whereas the sensitivity of 92.9% was maintained.",1996,8765818,no
Effects of fungal beta-glucan and interferon-gamma on the secretory functions of murine alveolar macrophages.,"We investigated the effect of a fungal component, soluble beta-glucan, on secretory functions of murine alveolar macrophages (AMs) in vitro. Stimulation by beta-glucan (500 microg/mL) or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma 100 U/mL) alone had a slight effect on AM functions, but when AMs were incubated together with beta-glucan and IFN-gamma, the production and secretion of some immune mediators, such as nitric oxide, interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), were markedly augmented. This combined effect of beta-glucan and IFN-gamma was based on a priming effect of IFN-gamma, because prestimulation with IFN-gamma followed by beta-glucan induced high nitric oxide production of AMs, but reversal of the sequence of treatments had only a slight effect. We also found that preincubation of AMs with IFN-gamma enhanced the binding of fluorescein-labeled beta-glucan on the AM surface, and this increased binding was abrogated to the control level by the addition of three species of soluble unlabeled (1-->3)-beta-D-glucans but not by soluble alpha-glucan. These data imply that the priming effect of IFN-gamma on the AM response to beta-glucan was dependent, at least in part, on the enhancement of beta-glucan specific binding sites on the AM surface. It was suggested that IFN-gamma is one of the principal factors controlling the pulmonary immune system against both severe fungal infection and inflammation via AM activation at the alveoli.",1996,8699115,no
Effects of mycotoxins on cytokine production and proliferation in EL-4 thymoma cells.,"The thymoma cell line EL4.IL-2 (EL-4) was used as a T-cell model to assess the immunotoxic effects of several mycotoxins produced by the Aspergillus-Penicillium and the Fusarium groups. EL-4 cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 12-acetate (PMA) in the presence of mycotoxins at various concentrations for 5 d and culture supernatants were analyzed for interleukins (IL) IL-2 and IL-5 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The cytokine effects were further related to proliferation and cell viability using the MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay with absorbance at 570 nm (A570) as the endpoint indicator. IL-2 and IL-5 levels were dramatically increased by cyclopiazonic acid at 50-1000 ng/ml, whereas IL-2 was significantly decreased at 10 microgram/ml. Proliferation was slightly increased at 100-1000 ng/ml cyclopiazonic acid but markedly depressed at 5 and 10 microgram/ml. When EL-4 cells were exposed to 5 and 10 microgram/ml of ochratoxin A, IL-2 production was markedly increased while IL-5 production was significantly decreased. The A570 was significantly decreased by ochratoxin A at 10 microgram/ml. IL-2 and Il-5 production was almost totally suppressed by patulin at concentrations > or = 500 ng/ml and by T-2 toxin at > or = 5 ng/ml. These effects occurred concurrently with marked depression of A570 in the MTT assay. Although A570 was unaffected by either zearalenone or alpha-zearalenol exposure, both IL-2 and IL-5 levels were significantly elevated by these toxins at 5 or 10 microgram/ml. IL-2 and IL-5 production were not affected in EL-4 cells cultured with either the Aspergillus-Penicillium toxins aflatoxin B1 and secalonic acid or the Fusarium toxins wortmannin, fumonisin B1, or fusaric acid at concentrations up to 10 microgram/ml. In total, the EL-4 culture studies indicated that cyclopiazonic acid, ochratoxin A, zearalenone, and alpha-zearalenol could stimulate cytokine production whereas patulin and T-2 toxin were inhibitory. Cytokine dysregulation was not always related directly to perturbations in proliferation. The results suggest that the EL-4 thymoma cell line could be a simple and effective in vitro model for evaluating immunotoxicity of various classes of environmental chemicals.",1996,8691508,no
Exposure-sensitization relationship for alpha-amylase allergens in the baking industry.,"Fungal alpha-amylase is an important occupational allergen in the bakery industry. Epidemiologic studies focusing on the relationship between alpha-amylase allergen exposure and work-related respiratory allergy, however, have not been reported yet. In this cross-sectional study, sensitization to occupational allergens and work-related symptoms were studied in 178 bakery workers and related to allergen exposure. Alpha-amylase allergen concentrations were measured in personal dust samples, using a sandwich enzyme immunoassay. All workers were categorized into groups on the basis of their job histories and the alpha-amylase exposure levels of their job titles. Of all workers 25% had one or more work-related symptoms. As much as 9% of the bakery workers showed a positive skin prick test reaction to fungal amylase, and in 8% amylase-specific IgE was demonstrated. Alpha-amylase exposure and atopy appeared to be the most important determinants of skin sensitization, with prevalence ratios for atopy of 20.8 (95% CI, 2.74 to 158) and for medium and high alpha-amylase exposure groups of 8.6 (95% CI, 1.01 to 74) and 15.9 (95% CI, 1.95 to 129), respectively. Furthermore, a positive association was found between positive skin prick tests to alpha-amylase and work-related respiratory symptoms. In conclusion, this study has shown that there is a strong and positive relationship between alpha-amylase allergen exposure levels in bakeries and specific sensitization in bakery workers.",1996,8680668,no
Inhibition of the transcription factors NF-kappa B and AP-1 underlies loss of cytokine gene expression in rat alveolar macrophages treated with a diffusible product from the spores of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"The spores of Aspergillus fumigatus have a survival advantage over other respirable fungal spores in the lung, leading to a number of lung diseases associated with this fungus. We have hypothesized that a component on the spore surface can inhibit the activation of alveolar macrophages, known to play an essential role in immune regulation in the lung. A diffusible product from the spores of A. fumigatus (AfD) inhibited the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) protein by alveolar macrophages in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Using a semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we also demonstrated a potent inhibitory effect of AfD on the production of proinflammatory cytokine transcripts in rat alveolar macrophages. The inhibition occurred at the level of transcription, with AfD inhibiting the synthesis of TNF alpha-and interleukin 6 (IL-6)-specific mRNA transcripts. No effect was seen on the synthesis of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) cytokine transcripts or on the expression of the housekeeping gene beta-actin. Furthermore, AfD specifically inhibited the activation of nuclear transcription factors NF-kappa B and AP-1, both of which are required for the coordinate upregulation of transcription of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6. We conclude that AfD can inhibit normal alveolar macrophage responses by selectively inhibiting the production of key inflammatory cytokines, and that the mechanism of inhibition is primarily at the level of transcriptional activation.",1996,8679226,no
Incidence and predictors of cytomegalovirus pneumonia in orthotopic liver transplant recipients. Boston Center for Liver Transplantation CMVIG Study Group.,"The incidence, predictors, and outcome of cytomegalovirus pneumonia in OLT recipients have not been well defined. We conducted an analysis of prospectively collected data from 141 OLT recipients who were included as part of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of CMV immune globulin prophylaxis. Cytomegalovirus pneumonia was diagnosed in 13 of 141 (9.2%) OLT recipients during the first year posttransplant and was associated with a higher 1-year mortality compared with those recipients without CMV pneumonia (84.6 vs. 17.2%, P=0.0001). Univariate analysis demonstrated that CMV viremia (P=0.001), invasive fungal disease (P=0.0001), donor(+)/pretransplant recipient(-) CMV serologic status (P=0.013), abdominal operation (excluding retransplantation) after liver transplantation (P=0.0027), bacteremia (P=0.0105), and advanced United Network of Organ Sharing status (P=0.023) were associated with CMV pneumonia. Cytomegalovirus viremia was diagnosed in 11 of 13 patients with CMV pneumonia at a median of 11 days (range 1-66 days) before diagnosis of CMV pneumonia. In a multivariate analysis using a time-dependent, Cox proportional hazards model, CMV viremia (RR=8.6, 95% CI 1.8-39.7, P=0.0012), invasive fungal disease (RR=6.5, 95% CI 2.1-20.3, P=0.0001), and abdominal reoperation (RR=4.4, 95% CI 1.4-13.1, P=0.0043) were found to be independent predictors of CMV pneumonia. The attributable mortality associated with CMV pneumonia within the first year after liver transplantation for the patients with CMV pneumonia was 67.4%. Intensified measures for prevention of CMV should be considered for patients at high risk of developing CMV pneumonia.",1996,8685949,no
"Expression of the Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase of Aspergillus fumigatus as determined by immunochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy.","A polyclonal antibody against purified Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) from the pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus was raised in a sheep. This antibody recognised purified A. fumigatus SOD, together with a single band of 19 kDa in A. fumigatus cytoplasmic antigen, by immunodevelopment of Western blots. The polyclonal serum did not recognise either the manganese or iron containing forms of the enzyme however, it was reactive against putative Cu,Zn SODs in other members of the genus Aspergillus. Immunofluorescent staining of A. fumigatus cultures demonstrated expression of the Cu,Zn SOD in conidia and hyphae, with the cell wall staining particularly intensely. Conidiophores were stained in an uniformly intense pattern. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that the SOD was present within the hyphal cell wall, although there was also labelling in the cytoplasm.

Identification of the reactive subunits of Aspergillus umbrosus involved in the antigenic response in farmer's lung.,"Farmer's lung (FL) is the most common form of extrinsic allergic alveolitis and the fungus Aspergillus umbrosus has frequently been associated with FL among Finnish farmers. IgG and IgA class antibodies against Aspergillus umbrosus are found in the serum of FL patients and healthy exposed farmers. So far the immunologically reactive subunits of Aspergillus umbrosus are unknown.The purpose of the study was to identify and localize the reactive subunits of Aspergillus umbrosus that are involved in the antigenic response in FL.The distribution of the primary antibody on the outer wall layers of 4- and 11 day-old fungi Aspergillus umbrosus was studied by pre-embedding immunolabelling with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)- and gold-conjugated antibodies. The surface carbohydrates of the outer wall layers were studied using FITC-conjugated lectins.FITC-conjugated antibodies from FL patient sera reacted with spores (conidia), phialides and hyphae, whereas the fruiting body, cleistothecia, remained unstainable. Immunofluorescence labelling was confirmed by immunolabelling electron microscopy, and gold-conjugated IgG antibodies were found on the outer cell walls of spinulose conidia, and in a less degree on the outer cell walls of hyphae and phialides. Only single gold particles were found scattered on the surfaces of cleistothecia. The surface carbohydrates of Aspergillus umbrosus conidia, vesicles, phialides and hyphae had a high affinity to GlcNAc beta 1- and Man alpha 1-/Glc alpha 1-specific lectins and only GlcNAc beta 1-specific lectins also reacted with the outer cell walls of cleistothecia. Blocking of the antigenic sites of Aspergillus umbrosus by preincubating antigen-coated enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates with lectins caused some inhibition, indicating that sites with the highest affinity for lectins were not always antigenic sites.Gold-and FITC -conjugated antibodies were distributed mostly on the outer wall layers of conidia, hyphae and phialides of Aspergillus umbrosus and GlcNAc beta 1-linked lectins had the strongest affinity to the outer wall layers.",1996,8809426,no
[Diagnosis of ABPA during a life-threatening asthma attack].,Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a disease with the clinical signs of asthma.

[Sero-diagnosis for pulmonary aspergillosis--its utility in early diagnosis].,"The clinical utility of Pastorex Aspergillus, a commercially available circulating aspergillus galactomannan antigen detection kit was evaluated. In animal models of pulmonary aspergillosis, it was extremely sensitive for detection of not only A. fumigatus antigen but also antigens of A. flavus and A. niger both in serum and urine. In a preliminary study in autopsied or clinically proven cases with aspergillus infections a high positive rate of antigen detection was obtained when it was applied prospectively. A total of 1,373 clinical samples obtained from patients with suspected aspergillus infection were examined. Among 67 patients giving antigen-positive results in their clinical samples including serum, urine, sputum and others, 17 patients proved to have aspergillus infection by histological or cultural studies. Sixteen patients were judged to be suspicious of aspergillus infection. Measurement of serum (1 --> 3) beta-D glucan by G-test in these cases was well correlated to the results of the antigen detection test. However, the serum showed often antigen-negative even when it was examined at the peak of illness. The rapid clearance of the antigen from circulation was considered to be one of the reasons for this phenomenon. In these cases, antigen detection in samples other than serum, such as urine, sputum, and pleural fluid was also useful. In conclusion, when using Pastorex Aspergillus to obtain the early diagnosis of aspergillus infection frequent examination in different types of samples is recommended.",1996,8752728,no
Specific IgG4 responses during chronic and transient antigen exposure in aspergillosis.,"The factors that lead to increased production of specific IgG subclasses are still largely unknown. Recent studies suggest that increased IgG4 responses may be related to prolonged antigen exposure. We present data showing that increased IgG4 responses are found under conditions of chronic exposure to Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) antigen. IgG(total), IgG subclass, and IgE responses were studied using ELISA, CAP-FEIA, and immunoblotting techniques in patients with pulmonary aspergilloma (PA), which is a model for chronic antigen exposure, and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), characterized by transient antigen exposure. Af-IgG1 was increased in patients with PA compared with those with ABPA. Patients with PA and IgE responses to Af and/or other inhalant allergens showed significantly higher Af-IgG4 responses than did patients with PA and negative IgE responses or patients with ABPA. Surveillance studies over time in individual patients showed concordance in Af-IgG1 and Af-IgG4 responses. Both Af-IgG1 and Af-IgG4 levels followed the course of disease progression and treatment. Immunoblotting revealed correlations between Af-IgG1 and Af-IgG4 binding to most, but not all, antigenic Af components. This study documents for the first time increased IgG4 levels under conditions of chronic exposure to fungal antigen in PA. Furthermore, a significantly higher IgG4 response was found in those patients with PA who produced IgE. The transient exposure to Af antigen during exacerbation of ABPA gives rise to transient elevations in IgG4 levels.",1996,8665060,no
Cross-reactivity between Aspergillus fumigatus and Penicillium.,"Rabbit anti-Aspergillus fumigatus, rabbit anti-Penicillium and sera from patients with precipitating antibodies against A. fumigatus or Penicillium were analyzed by means of inhibition experiments in ELISA (IgG) and (or) immunoblot analysis (IgG). Sera from healthy donors were also analyzed in ELISA inhibition and sera from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in RAST (IgE) inhibition. Most sera from patients with precipitins against Penicillium gave anti-A. fumigatus ELISA titers in the same range as sera from patients with aspergillosis. Anti-Penicillium IgG reacted with several A. fumigatus antigens with molecular weights between 28 and 130 kD. This reaction could be inhibited by the carbohydrate fraction of A. fumigatus and by extracts of related fungi. The binding to Penicillium of IgE antibodies in sera from patients with ABPA could be inhibited by A. fumigatus almost as effectively as by Penicillium. The binding of these antibodies to A. fumigatus was only slightly affected by Penicillium antigens. The presence of IgG antibodies that cross-react with A. fumigatus may strongly affect the immunoblot patterns and ELISA results obtained with sera from patients with aspergillosis. Penicillium spp. probably belong to the major stimuli which induce the synthesis of so-called naturally occurring antibodies to A. fumigatus.",1996,8645995,no
Characterization of soybean allergens causing sensitization of occupationally exposed bakers.,"Fourteen bakers suffering from workplace-related respiratory symptoms and sensitized to soybean were studied. Twelve of them were also allergic to wheat flour, 10 to rye flour, and five to alpha-amylase of Aspergillus oryzae (Asp o 2). IgE estimation by RAST strongly indicated that the trypsin inhibitor and lipoxidase are major allergens of soybean. Various allergenic components could be characterized by immunoblotting after two-dimensional electrophoresis. Our RAST and immunoblotting results show an interindividually different allergic response to inhalative soybean constituents, and that the trypsin inhibitor (20 kDa, pI approximately 4.5) is an important inhalative soybean allergen recognized by IgE antibodies in the sera of 86% of the examined sensitized bakers.",1996,8836337,no
Enhanced IgE response to Candida albicans in postoperative invasive candidiasis.,"Invasive candidiasis is a life-threatening complication problem in post-operative and immunocompromized patients, e.g. those treated by intensive care. Candida is frequently cultured from the mucous membranes of hospital patients and fungal cultures offer little diagnostic help. Other diagnostic methods, such as blood cultures, serology and diagnostic imaging techniques produce results too late and, if positive, low sensitivity.To study the value of Candida-specific antibodies, especially those of IgE class, in diagnosing invasive Candida infection.The immunoglobulins IgE, IgG and IgM responses to antigens of Candida albicans in the sera of 14 patients with culture, biopsy and/or autopsy proven postoperative invasive candidiasis and of 11 colonized and 19 non-colonized operated patients were studied by mannan radioallergosorbent test (RAST), mannan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblotting.Detection of IgE antibodies to C. albicans polysaccharide (mannan) and protein antigens proved specific and sensitive in diagnostics of invasive candidiasis after major abdominal surgery. IgE rose early in the course of the infection and the method made a clear distinction between invasive infection and mucous colonization. Immunoblotting for protein antibodies was most sensitive while nitrocellulose-RAST for mannan antibodies was most specific. The combined use of immunoblotting and RAST increased the sensitivity and the specificity. Determinations of anti-Candida IgG and IgM antibodies had low sensitivity and specificity.Critically ill patients with invasive candidiasis develop IgE antibodies to Candida antigens probably because of disturbed TH1/TH2 responses. Determination of specific IgE antibodies can be used as a diagnostic aid in the early stage of invasive Candida infection.",1996,8732243,no
Molecular cloning and expression of a recombinant Aspergillus fumigatus protein Asp f II with significant immunoglobulin E reactivity in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"The cDNA of Aspergillus fumigatus encoding an allergen was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The 987 bp long cDNA clone expressed a recombinant protein Asp f II of 34 kd. This protein exhibited binding to immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the serum samples from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). The patients with ABPA and central bronchiectasis demonstrated high levels of serum IgE antibodies, whereas patients with ABPA without central bronchiectasis, patients with asthma and Aspergillus skin test reactivity but no evidence of ABPA, and patients with aspergilloma showed only low levels of IgE antibody to Asp f II. In two-dimensional electrophoresis, a native antigen electroeluted from an A. fumigatus culture filtrate antigen preparation showed an isoelectric point and molecular weight similar to that of Asp f II. In a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the IgE antibody reactivity of Asp f II with patient serum samples could be significantly inhibited by culture filtrate antigens of A. fumigatus. These results indicate that Asp f II has immunologic reactivities comparable to those of native A. fumigatus antigens. The recombinant Asp f II can be expressed in E. coli in large quantities and should prove useful as a standardized allergen for sensitive and specific immunodiagnosis of ABPA, especially in patients with central bronchiectasis.",1996,9273358,no
Efficient expression of a Phanerochaete chrysosporium manganese peroxidase gene in Aspergillus oryzae.,"A manganese peroxidase gene (mnp1) from Phanerochaete chrysosporium was efficiently expressed in Aspergillus oryzae. Expression was achieved by fusing the mature cDNA of mnp1 with the A. oryzae Taka amylase promoter and secretion signal. The 3' untranslated region of the glucoamylase gene of Aspergillus awamori provided the terminator. The recombinant protein (rMnP) was secreted in an active form, permitting rapid detection and purification. Physical and kinetic properties of rMnP were similar to those of the native protein. The A. oryzae expression system is well suited for both mechanistic and site-directed mutagenesis studies.",1996,8975615,no
Prospective sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for serum galactomannan: early predictive value and clinical use in invasive aspergillosis.,"The delay between the onset of invasive aspergillosis and the start of antifungal therapy is crucial for the patient's recovery. Early diagnosis is difficult in cancer patients through lack of precocious specific signs. We have investigated the clinical usefulness of circulating Aspergillus antigen monitoring in pediatric hematology patients with a new sensitive sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.A prospective study was conducted by assessing circulating galactomannan levels in high risk patients. Thirty-seven patients studied during an 18-month period were evaluated twice weekly during neutropenic phases with the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for serum Aspergillus galactomannan.Twelve patients had one or more episodes of positive circulating galactomannan detection, 10 of whom developed presumptive invasive aspergillosis. The clinical and radiologic signs occurred at a mean of 13.4 days (range, 0 to 48) after circulating galactomannan detection and reversed in 6 patients treated with amphotericin B at the same time circulating galactomannan detection became negative. Reappearance of circulating galactomannan was observed during subsequent neutropenic periods in 3 patients.The detection of galactomannan at concentrations as low as 1 ng/ml can be useful for the early initiation of antifungal therapy and monitoring treatment in clinically documented lung aspergillosis. This technique coupled with chest computed tomography could help to restrict the need of invasive diagnostic procedures in fragile patients.",1996,8852911,no
Immunohistochemical diagnosis of systemic bovine zygomycosis by murine monoclonal antibodies.,"Murine monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) against water-soluble somatic antigens (WSSA) and the wall fraction (WF) from Rhizopus arrhizus (Rhizopus oryzae) were produced in vitro by fusion of splenocytes from immunized BALB/c mice with mouse myeloma X63-Ag 8.653 cells. Supernatants reacting only with homologous antigens in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were subsequently screened for reactivity with homologous fungi in immunohistochemical techniques. All four Mabs raised against the WF of A. arrhizus failed to react on tissues. However, four of the Mabs raised against the WSSA of R. arrhizus (Mab-WSSA-RA-1 through Mab-WSSA-RA-4) revealed a high homologous reactivity on tissues and the cross-reactivity of these were subsequently evaluated on tissues containing other members of the family Mucoraceae and other unrelated fungi. On tissues and on immunoblots all four Mabs reacted identically and specifically with members of the family Mucoraceae, i.e., Absidia corymbifera, R. arrhizus, and Rhizomucor pusillus. The Mabs were all isotyped as IgM antibodies, were nonprecipitating, and reacted with homologous antigens with molecular masses from I4 to 110 kDa. With WSSA from A. corymbifera and R. pusillus the four Mabs were bound to antigens from 14 to 52 kDa and from 20 to 28 kDa, respectively. The diagnosis of 145 bovine lesions obtained by one of the specific Mabs (Mab-WSSA-RA-1) were compared to results obtained by heterologously absorbed polyclonal antibodies. In most lesions (n = 140 [approximately 97%]) the Mab and the polyclonal antibodies reacted in a similar pattern, i.e., positively for zygomycosis in 89 lesions, negatively in 41 aspergillosis lesions, and negatively in 10 undiagnosed lesions. Hyphae within two of four lesions in lymph nodes, which were not stained by the polyclonal antibodies, reacted with the specific Mab. However, in another three lesions of lymph nodes stained by the polyclonal antibodies no reactivity was seen with the Mab-WSSA-RA-1. The immunoreactivity of the Mabs (Mab-WSSA-RA-1 through Mab-WSSA-RA-4) raised against WSSA of R. arrhizus justify their application for the in situ diagnosis of systemic bovine zygomycosis.",1996,8801711,no
Aspergillosis: diagnosis and treatment.,"The incidence of invasive aspergillosis is increasing rapidly in the developed world with two Aspergillus spp., A. fumigatus and A. flavus, causing the majority of infections (85-90% and 5-10%, respectively). The major risk factors are profound neutropenia (< or =1000 x 10(6) cells/L), prolonged neutropenia, neutrophil function deficits, and corticosteroid therapy. Useful diagnostic techniques include sputum culture, CT scan, bronchoscopy with microscopy and culture, percutaneous lung biopsy, open lung biopsy and serology. Invasive aspergillosis has an almost 100% mortality rate if untreated. Amphotericin B is the usual first-line therapy although it is associated with a high failure rate. Itraconazole (> or =400 mg daily) is a useful alternative and surgical resection may be life saving in some cases. The efficacy of the initial therapy is critical for improving mortality rates.",1996,18611704,no
Heating inactivates the enzymatic activity and partially inactivates the allergenic activity of Asp o 2.,"Sensitization to various flours and flour additives in the baking industry has been known for some time. However, most studies refer to allergens in their native state.The aim of our study was to find out how high temperatures during the baking process influence enzymatic and allergenic activities of the common flour additive alpha-amylase (Asp o 2), a relevant allergen for bakers derived from Aspergillus oryzae.In order to assess the allergenicity of Asp o 2 during the baking process, four to 11 correspondingly sensitized bakers were investigated by Enzyme Allergo-Sorbent Test (EAST) with native Asp o 2 and Asp o 2 heated to 80, 90, 95, 99.8 or 200 degrees C. Furthermore, the enzymatic activity was assayed in simulated baking processes at the above mentioned temperatures.Elevated temperatures resulted in a gradual loss of IgE antibodies' recognition of Asp o 2 in two commercially available enzyme products. The enzymatic activity decreased more rapidly. Heating the enzyme to 200 degrees C abolished both the enzymatic and the allergenic activity of the enzyme.Based on these results, alpha-amylase in flour additives partially retains its allergenicity. This finding could be relevant for consumers.",1996,8835132,no
Immunoblotting patterns in the serodiagnosis of aspergilloma: antibody response to the 90kDa Aspergillus fumigatus antigen.,"At present there are no accepted criteria to assess the usefulness of Western blot assays for the serodiagnosis of aspergilloma. An Aspergillus fumigatus cytosolic fraction complex (CFC) composed of four proteins (p90, p60, p40, and p37) has been identified. The usefulness of Western blotting with CFC antigens for the serodiagnosis of aspergilloma was evaluated in 25 patients with well-established diagnoses and in 94 controls. The most consistently reactive antigen was p90 (92% of patients with aspergilloma), followed by p40 (76%) and the entire CFC taken together (76%). With these data, interpretive criteria for positive and negative immunoblots were established, with p90 indicated as a helpful marker of aspergilloma.",1996,8801087,no
Comparison of an enzyme immunoassay and latex agglutination test for detection of galactomannan in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.,"Aspergillus antigenemia was followed up in 215 consecutively observed bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients over a period of two years, using both a latex agglutination test and a sandwich immunocapture enzyme immunoassay (EIA) with a rat antigalactomannan monoclonal antibody as capture and detector antibody. For each patient, sequential sera (3 to 20) were obtained before and after BMT. No positivity was observed before BMT. After BMT, the EIA and latex agglutination test were positive in 19 and 4 patients respectively of 25 patients with confirmed aspergillosis and 14 and 7 of 15 patients with probable aspergillosis. In 19 of 25 patients with confirmed aspergillosis and 9 of 15 patients with probable aspergillosis, the EIA was more sensitive and detected infection earlier than the latex test. In all positive cases, antigenemia rapidly increased in sequential samples and remained strongly positive. In 31 of 169 (19%) BMT patients without clinical signs of aspergillosis, the EIA was occasionally positive in samples taken within the first month after BMT, giving a specificity of 81% in these patients. In non-BMT patients suffering from other diseases (n = 77), the specificity was 98.7%. The overall positive and negative predictive values for the EIA were 54% and 95% respectively. These results favour the use of EIA for early diagnosis and monitoring of aspergillosis in BMT patients, although the predictive value of transient positivity remains to be ascertained.",1996,8801086,no
Post-lung transplant biopsies: an 8-year Loyola experience.,"A total of 125 transplant procedures involving the lung have been performed at Loyola University of Chicago in 120 patients. There were 67 single (40 right, 27 left), 44 bilateral single, 2 double lung, and 12 heart-lungs (HL) transplant procedures. This paper summarizes the pathologic findings in 565 transbronchial, 102 endobronchial, 20 open lung, and 92 endomyocardial biopsies and compares them with the recommendations in the published literature. The lung biopsies were evaluated according to the Working Formulation, Lung Rejection Study Group, International Society of Heart Transplantation. In transbronchial biopsies, all of which were from the transplanted lungs, the number of alveolated lung fragments ranged from 0 to 14 (mean, 5). Two hundred twelve biopsies showed no rejection, 113 had minimal rejection, 133 had mild rejection, 34 had moderate rejection, and 1 had severe acute rejection. Active airway damage (Grade B) was seen in 48 biopsies, which were graded from minimal to severe based on the amount of inflammation. Chronic rejection (Grade C) was diagnosed in 23, chronic vascular rejection (Grade D) in 8, and acute vasculitis (Grade E) in 9 biopsies. Routine trichrome and elastic van Gieson stains did not add to the diagnosis. All biopsies were routinely stained with immunoperoxidase for cytomegalovirus. Cytomegalovirus was diagnosed in 84 biopsies, 54 by both H&E and immunoperoxidase, 23 by immunoperoxidase alone, and 5 by H&E alone. The endobronchial biopsy of the anastomotic site had nonspecific inflammation in 46 biopsies. Twenty-nine had infection with a specific organism, Aspergillus and Candida in each of 8 biopsies by Gomori's methenamine silver stain, cytomegalovirus in 7 (4 by H&E and immunoperoxidase 3 by immunoperoxidase), bacteria in 4, and fungal hyphae in 2 biopsies. In the 12 patients with heart-lung transplants, a total of 92 endomyocardial, 35 transbronchial, and 1 endobronchial biopsies were obtained. Acute rejection was seen only in 2 endomyocardial biopsies, whereas the transbronchial biopsy showed acute mild or moderate rejection in 10, chronic rejection in 1, and cytomegalovirus infection in six biopsies. We conclude that: (a) all biopsies with alveolated lung parenchyma can be evaluated for rejection and infection yielding clinically significant diagnoses",1996,8657718,no
Automated serology with recombinant allergens. A feasibility study.,"Diagnosis of allergic conditions is based on skin prick- and/or intradermal tests and on serology. Both methods make use of allergenic preparations and the results mainly depend on the quality of the substances applied and on the reactivity of the subjects. Recombinant allergens can be produced as highly pure proteins. They may contribute to a significant improvement of the diagnosis of allergic diseases provided that the allergens became available in a pure, fully antigenic form suitable for routine assessments. We have studied the diagnostic properties of recombinant Aspergillus fumigatus allergen I (rAsp f I/a), a major allergen recognised by about 60% of the A. fumigatus allergic individuals, to test the feasibility of using recombinant allergens for automated serology in the Pharmacia CAP System, a new solid-phase immunoassay. ImmunoCAPs carrying immobilised rAsp f I/a were produced and evaluated using sera from well characterised patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), allergic asthmatics with or without A. fumigatus sensitisation, and healthy control persons. The clinical parameters used for the diagnosis of allergy to A. fumigatus were RAST and skin test reactivity to commercial A. fumigatus extracts. IgE antibodies recognising rAsp f I/a were determined by a direct antigen-specific ELISA and with the newly developed rAsp f I/a ImmunoCAPs. Quantitative results from the two rAsp f I/a detection systems correlated closely, indicating that this recombinant allergen can be incorporated in the Pharmacia CAP System with unaltered antigenic activity. The behaviour of a panel of recombinant A. fumigatus allergens in the Pharmacia CAP System will be evaluated in the near future to assess the potential of recombinant allergens for the automated diagnosis of allergic conditions.",1996,9095230,no
Development of murine monoclonal antibodies for the immunohistochemical diagnosis of systemic bovine aspergillosis.,"Murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against water-soluble somatic antigens (WSSA) and the wall fraction (WF) from Aspergillus fumigatus were produced by fusion of splenocytes from immunized BALB/c mice with mouse myeloma X63-Ag 8.653 cells. The supernatants of in vitro cultured hybridomas were initially screened for reactivity with the WSSA and the WF from A. fumigatus and WSSA of other fungi in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Supernatants reacting only with A. fumigatus antigens were subsequently screened for homologous and heterologous reactivity with immunohistochemical techniques using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from experimentally infected mice. Because of a high immunohistochemical reactivity with homologous fungi, 4 MAbs raised against A. fumigatus WSSA and WF were selected for a further evaluation of cross-reactivity (diagnostic specificity) in immunohistochemical and immunoblotting assays. In immunohistochemical assays, all MAbs raised against WSSA cross-reacted heavily with a number of other fungal species. All 4 MAbs (MAb-WF-AF-1-4) raised against the WF reacted strongly with hyphae of Aspergillus spp. hyphae of Scedosporium apiospermum were also strongly labeled by MAb-WF-AF-3 and -4. The 2 specifically reacting MAbs (MAb-WF-AF-1 and -2) were of the IgM biotype and were precipitating, and in immunoblotting experiments both bound to a 106-kD antigen of the WF, whereas they did not bind to WSSA of A. fumigatus. One of the 2 aspergillosis-specific MAbs (MAb-WF-AF-1) was used to screen 145 mycotic lesions of cattle. The diagnoses on bovine lesions obtained by MAb-WF-AF-1 were compared with results based on reactivity with heterologously absorbed polyclonal antibodies and, for some lesions, to culture results. In the vast majority of lesions (n = 133), the MAb-WF-AF-1 and the polyclonal anti-Aspergillus antibodies reacted in a similar pattern, i.e., positively in 41 aspergillosis lesions and negatively in 92 zygomycotic lesions. Hyphae in 3 of 12 lesions that were not stained by the polyclonal antibodies reacted with the specific MAb-WF-AF-1",1996,9026084,no
Immunochemical detection of ochratoxin A in black Aspergillus strains.,"One hundred and fifty-seven strains belonging to Aspergillus section Nigri were tested for ochratoxin A production using three different methods: a relatively new immunochemical method based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The monoclonal antibody-based ELISA technique was successfully used to screen for low levels of ochratoxin A in the black Aspergilli without concentrating the culture filtrates. The results were confirmed by TLC and HPLC analysis and chemical derivatization. These latter methods required concentrated filtrates. Ochratoxin A was detected in the culture filtrates of five of the 12 A. carbonarius strains, none of the 45 A. japonicus strains and three of the 100 isolates in the A. niger aggregate (A. foetidus, A. awamori and A. niger.",1996,8981783,no
Endothelin in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is increased in lung-transplanted patients.,"Animal studies have shown increased endothelin in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid during unmodified rejection. We performed radioimmunoassay of endothelin in 59 BAL fluid samples from ten patients at different times after lung transplantation. All patients received immunosuppressive therapy (cyclosporin, azathioprine and methylprednisolone). Reference BAL samples were obtained from six controls. Of the 59 test samples, five were collected during rejection episodes, confirmed by clinical outcome, BAL cytology and radiology (rejection group), and 19 were taken during bacterial, viral or fungal infection (infection group). The endothelin content of BAL (pg/ml) was significantly greater in the rejection group than in the infection group (61.1 +/- 3.8 vs 40.6 +/- 2.0) or in the 35 samples taken in uncomplicated course after lung transplantation (40.9 +/- 5.4), p < 0.01. The endothelin level in BAL fluid from the controls was only 3.0 +/- 1.4 pg/ml, significantly less (p < 0.005) than in all the lung-transplanted groups. Endothelin in BAL fluid thus was increased after lung transplantation, and still further during rejection.",1996,8976030,no
Evaluation of the diagnostic value of the measurement of (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan in patients with pulmonary aspergillosis.,"The value of the measurement of (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan, a major and common cell wall constituent of fungi, for diagnosing pulmonary aspergillosis was assessed in comparison with that of conventional examinations. The concentrations of (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan in sera was elevated in 7 out of 8 patients with active aspergillosis, but not in cases without active diseases, except for one sample. Further, the concentrations well reflected the activity of the aspergillosis in each case. Regarding conventional examinations, with the immunodiffusion test it was difficult to detect the present activity of the disease. The radioallergosorbent test was useful for diagnosing bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, but not for other types of aspergillosis. The Aspergillus-specific component, galactomannan, was insensitive and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay gave highly variable results. Thus, although the assessment of the specificity of the assay is still necessary, compared with other tests, the assay of (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan has the advantage of diagnosing pulmonary aspergillosis and also of assessing the disease activity.",1996,8966370,no
Clinical review of nasal allergy due to fungus.,"In our clinic we have encountered nasal allergy due to fungi such as Candida, Aspergillus, and Alternaria. We therefore conducted a retrospective study of patients who consulted our Department between 1984 and 1991. A clinical review of patients who showed a positive skin test for Candida, Aspergillus, or Alternaria was performed. Our study revealed that Alternaria showed the highest ratio of strong positivity upon both RAST and skin test among the three fungi examined. These results led us to reconsider Alternaria as an important fungal antigen.",1996,8908281,no
Aspergillus infections: problems in diagnosis and treatment.,"Invasive aspergillosis is a common infection in patients who are immunocompromised, particularly in oncology patients, patients receiving other immunosuppressive therapy, bone marrow transplant patients, and HIV-infected patients. The diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis is difficult in the absence of tissue biopsy and histologic confirmation. Therefore, the need for and progress in recent advances in the development of highly sensitive and specific serodiagnostic tests for the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis have been reviewed. Anti-Aspergillus antibody detection lacks the utility to lead to early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. However, sensitive methods that detect significant amounts of Aspergillus antigen in body fluids, primarily serum, of high risk patients are currently being evaluated and may provide a noninvasive early diagnostic test that is both sensitive and specific. Our recent results with an inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which detects small but significant amounts of Aspergillus antigen in serum, in 35 patients with invasive aspergillosis are discussed. Also, current antifungal agents with anti-Aspergillus activity that have the potential for use as therapy or prophylaxis are briefly reviewed.",1996,8789599,no
Evaluation of eight antibody tests and one antigen test for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.,"Eight Aspergillus antibody detection assays--three indirect haemagglutination assays (IHA-LD, IHA-Roche, IHA-Fumouze), three enzyme immunoassays (EIA-IgG, EIA-IgM, EIA-IgA, DDV) and two complement fixation tests (CF-metabolic and CF-somatic, Virion--and one latex agglutination test (LAT) for Aspergillus galactomannan antigen detection (Sanofi Pasteur) were evaluated in 14 patients with proven invasive aspergillosis (a total of 47 serum samples and one cerebrospinal fluid sample) and in 68 selected control individuals (one selected serum sample each). For the antibody tests, sensitivity ranged from 14% to 36% and specificity from 72% to 99%. The antigen detection test had a sensitivity of 36% and a specificity of 100%. Currently commercially available antibody detection assays for the serodiagnosis of invasive aspergillosis are inadequate.

Elevated concentrations of IgG to A. f. and C. a. were found in 6 and 12 patients, respectively. Serodiagnosis was confirmed by a direct detection of the fungi in the bronchi (cytology of the lavage, culturing). It is highly probable that opportunistic fungi may be involved in pulmonary dissemination.

A Gossypium arboreum cell suspension culture which produces the sesquiterpene phytoalexin gossypol showed a time-dependent 10-fold increase in a 1.9-kb mRNA in response to a challenge by a preparation from Verticillium dahliae. The mRNA prepared from these elicited cultures was used to isolated two cDNA clones that contain open frames coding for proteins of 554 amino acids with M(r) 64,096 and 64,118. The encoded protein shows a significant degree of sequence identity with the other known plant terpene cyclases. Western blot analyses with a cross-reactive monoclonal antibody from a related sesquiterpene synthase in Nicotiana tabacum showed a time-dependent increase of a 65-kDa protein which reached a maximal level 24 h post elicitor treatment. The encoded protein from the pXC1 cDNA was produced in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity column chromatography. The enzymatic properties of this protein were identified by a radiochemical assay for cyclization of farnesyldiphosphate and a product structure was assigned by GC-MS, chiral phase GC, and NMR analyses as (+)-delta-cadinene. The fungal-elicited production of a (+)-delta-cadinene synthase is consistent with a role for this enzyme as the first committed step in the pathways leading to the related phytoalexins gossypol and lacinilene C in cotton.",1995,8554317,no
Quantification of DNA damage and repair in amino acid auxotrophs and UV-sensitive mutants of Aspergillus nidulans using an ELISA.,"An ELISA used to investigate DNA repair in mammalian cells has been adapted to investigate mutagen-induced DNA damage and repair in protoplasts of Aspergillus nidulans. The assay shows a reduced rate of repair of DNA damage in methionine and arginine auxotrophs (methG and argB), which were shown previously to be hypersensitive to UV radiation and chemical mutagens. The assay also showed a considerably reduced ability to repair mutagen-induced damage in the uv-sensitive mutants uvsB and uvsH. The increased sensitivity of amino acids auxotrophs to mutagens is, therefore, correlated with a reduced capacity to repair mutagen-induced DNA damage.",1995,8543032,no
Fungal infections in solid organ transplant recipients.,"Invasive fungal infections occur in 5% to 45% of solid organ transplant recipients, and are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised population. The net depression of host defenses and environmental factors, such as preoperative exposures to endemic mycoses or nosocomial and specific surgery-associated exposures, affect the development of invasive infection. Most fungal infections in solid organ transplant recipients occur within the first 2 months after transplantation. The most common pathogens in the majority of solid organ transplant recipients are Candida spp, followed by Aspergillus sp. Diagnosis is best made by a high index of suspicion and aggressive acquisition of specimens for culture serologic tests are useful for infections due to Cryptococcus neoformans and Histoplasma capsulatum. Amphotericin B is the drug of choice for life-threatening infections. The triazoles, fluconazole and itraconazole, may be effective alternatives for less serious infections due to susceptible organisms. Prophylactic and preemptive treatment strategies require further study.",1995,8747778,no
The alpha-D-mannan core of a complex cell-wall heteroglycan of Trichoderma reesei is responsible for beta-glucosidase activation.,"A heteroglycan responsible for the binding of the enzyme beta-1,4-D-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21) to fungal cell walls was isolated from cell walls of the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei. The heteroglycan, composed of mannose, galactose, glucose, and glucuronic acid, also activated beta-1,4-D-glucosidase, beta-1,4-D-xylosidase and N-acetyl-beta-1,4-D-glucosaminidase activity in vitro. The structural backbone of this heteroglycan was prepared by acid hydrolysis and gel filtration. The molecular structure of the core of the heteroglycan was determined by NMR studies as a linear alpha-1,6-D-mannan. The mannan core obtained by acid degradation stimulated the beta-glucosidase activity by 90%. Several glycosidases from Aspergillus niger were also activated by the T. reesei heteroglycan. The beta-glucosidase of Trichoderma was activated by mannan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to a comparable extent.",1995,8588743,no
Comparison of antigen detection and PCR assay using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for diagnosing invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in patients receiving treatment for hematological malignancies.,"The performance of a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) which detects Aspergillus galactomannan (GM) was evaluated in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples from 19 patients who were treated for hematological malignancies and who were suspected of having invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). All patients had fever and pulmonary infiltrates on the chest roentgenogram on the day that the BAL fluid was obtained. The ELISA results were compared with the results of culture and Aspergillus genus-specific PCR analysis of BAL fluid samples. ELISA was also performed with serum samples. Aspergillus species were detected by PCR or ELISA with BAL fluid samples from five of seven patients who had radiological evidence of IPA. Serum ELISA results were positive for all patients with ELISA-positive BAL fluid, and for four patients the serum ELISA was positive before the BAL fluid was obtained. PCR and ELISA were positive for 2 and 1 of 10 BAL fluid samples, respectively, obtained from patients without radiological evidence of IPA, and 5 and 2 of 35 BAL fluid samples, respectively, obtained from nonneutropenic patients. This preliminary investigation suggests that GM may be detected by ELISA in BAL fluid samples from patients at risk of IPA, but that monitoring of serum GM levels may allow for the earlier diagnosis of IPA. However, further evaluation in prospective studies is required.",1995,8586691,no
"Plasma (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan and fungal antigenemia in patients with candidemia, aspergillosis, and cryptococcosis.","(1-->3)-beta-D-Glucan is one of the major structural components of fungi, and it seems that it can be detected by the fractionated (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan-sensitive component from a Limulus lysate, factor G. We evaluated the concentration of (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan by using factor G and other fungal antigens in 24 patients with clinical evidence of mycosis and 36 healthy subjects. The mean concentration of (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan in the plasma of the healthy subjects was found to be 2.7 +/- 1.9 pg/ml (range, < 6.9 pg/ml), and it was found to be substantially higher in all 11 patients with candidemia (mean, 2,207.4 pg/ml range, 325.4 to 8,449.0 pg/ml). Eight of those 11 patients with candidemia (73%) were positive for the Cand-Tec heat-labile candida antigen and only 3 patients (27%) were positive for mannan antigen.

Stable accumulation of Aspergillus niger phytase in transgenic tobacco leaves.,"Phytase from Aspergillus niger increases the availability of phosphorus from feed for monogastric animals by releasing phosphate from the substrate phytic acid. A phytase cDNA was constitutively expressed in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants. Secretion of the protein to the extracellular fluid was established by use of the signal sequence from the tobacco pathogen-related protein S. The specific phytase activity in isolated extracellular fluid was found to be approximately 90-fold higher than in total leaf extract, showing that the enzyme was secreted. This was confirmed by use of immunolocalization. Despite differences in glycosylation, specific activities of tobacco and Aspergillus phytase were identical. Phytase was found to be biologically active and to accumulate in leaves up to 14.4% of total soluble protein during plant maturation. Comparison of phytase accumulation and relative mRNA levels showed that phytase stably accumulated in transgenic leaves during plant growth.",1995,8539288,no
Effects of maize weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) on production of aflatoxin B1 by Aspergillus flavus in stored corn.,"Insects play an important role as facilitators of the aflatoxin-producing fungus, Aspergillus flavus Link, in both preharvest and postharvest corn. The current study investigated the role of maize weevils, Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky, in enhancing aflatoxin B1 content in stored corn. In laboratory experiments, aflatoxin B1 was quantified with an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on corn following artificial infestation with adult weevils that had each been topically treated with 100 spores of A. flavus. Corn kernels infested with A. flavus-contaminated weevils had significantly higher levels of aflatoxin B1 than A. flavus-inoculated corn without weevils. The presence of maize weevils resulted in increased kernel moisture content during incubation, and grain moisture was positively correlated with aflatoxin content across treatments receiving spores. Aflatoxin B1 levels were higher in corn treated with fungus-contaminated weevils compared with corn that was mechanically damaged and inoculated with spores, which in turn had more aflatoxin than undamaged corn treated with spores. Aflatoxin B1 content in corn increased with time of weevil exposure from 7 to 21 d, but decreased after 28 d of exposure. Aflatoxin levels in infested corn increased significantly with increased numbers of A. flavus-contaminated weevils. Maize weevils carried spores both internally and externally however, substantial numbers of spores were intimately associated with the exoskeleton of adult weevils. These findings indicate that maize weevils facilitate the growth of A. flavus and aflatoxin production in corn by increasing surface area susceptible to fungal infection and increasing moisture content as a result of weevil metabolic activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1995,8537546,no
An immunodominant 90-kilodalton Aspergillus fumigatus antigen is the subunit of a catalase.,"We have identified, purified, and characterized structurally and functionally a 90-kDa immunodominant antigen associated with the water-soluble fraction of Aspergillus fumigatus. This antigen is recognized by 90.3% of serum samples from patients with aspergilloma and should be considered either by itself or better in combination with other purified antigens as a candidate for developing a standardized immunoassay for the detection of aspergilloma. p90 is a glycoprotein containing at least two two N-linked sugar chains of 2 and 5 kDa, respectively, which are not necessary for its reactivity with aspergilloma serum samples. Using specific anti-p90 rabbit serum, we have demonstrated that under native conditions, p90 exists in oligomeric form and has associated catalase activity. This activity is resistant to extreme temperatures (> 60 degrees C), reducing agents (40 mM dithiothreitol), high concentrations of denaturing agents such as 8 M urea and 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and treatments with ethanol-chloroform-water (5:3:10 [vol/vol]) mixtures.",1995,7591135,no
"Cre1, the carbon catabolite repressor protein from Trichoderma reesei.","In order to investigate the mechanism of carbon catabolite repression in the industrially important fungus Trichoderma reesei, degenerated PCR-primers were designed to amplify a 0.7-bp fragment of the cre1 gene, which was used to clone the entire gene. It encodes a 402-amino acid protein with a calculated M(r) of 43.6 kDa. Its aa-sequence shows 55.6% and 54.7% overall similarity to the corresponding genes of Aspergillus nidulans and A. niger, respectively. Similarity was restricted to the aa-region containing the C2H2 zinc finger and several aa-regions rich in proline and basic amino acids, which may be involved in the interaction with other proteins. Another aa-region rich in the SPXX-motif that has been considered analogous to a region of yeast RGR1p, was instead identified as a domain occurring in several eucaryotic transcription factors. The presence of the cre1 translation product was demonstrated with polyclonal antibodies against Cre1, which identified a protein of 43 (+/- 2) kDa in cell-free extracts from T. reesei. A Cre1 protein fragment from the two zinc fingers to the region similar to the aa-sequence of eucaryotic transcription factors, was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase. EMSA and in vitro footprinting revealed binding of the fusion protein to the sequence 5'-GCGGAG-3', which matches well with the A. nidulans consensus sequence for CreA binding (5'-SYGGRG-3'). Cell-free extracts of T. reesei formed different complexes with DNA-fragments carrying this binding sites, and the presence of Cre1 and additional proteins in these complexes was demonstrated. We conclude that T. reesei Cre1 is the functional homologue of Aspergillus CreA and that it binds to its target sequence probably as a protein complex.",1995,8521952,no
"An acetylglucomannan esterase of Aspergillus oryzae purification, characterization and role in the hydrolysis of O-acetyl-galactoglucomannan.","An acetyl glucomannan esterase (AGME) was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from the culture supernatant of Aspergillus oryzae. This new enzyme had a molecular mass of 36 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.6. It was most active in the pH range 5.0-5.5 and was stable for 24 h at 40 degrees C at pH 5.0-6.0. The purified esterase liberated acetic acid from O-acetyl-galactoglucomannan, O-acetyl-4-O- methylglucuronoxylan and alpha-naphtyl acetate. The specific activity was 10-times higher for acetylated mannan than for acetylated xylan. The enzyme was able to act on polymeric substrate but activity was clearly enhanced by addition of mannanase from Trichoderma reesei and alpha-galactosidase from guar seeds. Presence of mannanase also increased the liberation of acetic acid in long-term hydrolysis (24 h), while the addition of alpha-galactosidase had no effect. No significant synergism between these two glycanases and the previously characterized esterase of A. oryzae (FE), which is also able to deacetylate galactoglucomannan, was observed. Even though the AGME had 8-times higher specific galactomannan deacetylating activity than the FE, the maximum amount of acetic acid liberated from the polymeric galactoglucomannan by AGME was only 80% of that of FE. Both esterases clearly enhanced the action of mannanase and alpha-galactosidase in the degradation of O-acetyl-galactoglucomannan isolated from Norway spruce.",1995,7576539,no
Characterization and localization of the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain in Aspergillus nidulans.,"Migration of nuclei throughout the mycelium is essential for the growth and differentiation of filamentous fungi. In Aspergillus nidulans, the nudA gene, which is involved in nuclear migration, encodes a cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain. In this paper we use antibodies to characterize the Aspergillus cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain (ACDHC) and to show that the ACDHC is concentrated at the growing tip of the fungal mycelium. We demonstrate that four temperature-sensitive mutations in the nudA gene result in a striking decrease in ACDHC protein. Cytoplasmic dynein has been implicated in nuclear division in animal cells. Because the temperature-sensitive nudA mutants are able to grow slowly with occasional nuclei found in the mycelium and are able to undergo nuclear division, we have created a deletion/disruption nudA mutation and a tightly downregulated nudA mutation. These mutants exhibit a phenotype very similar to that of the temperature-sensitive nudA mutants with respect to growth, nuclear distribution, and nuclear division. This suggests that there are redundant backup motor proteins for both nuclear migration and nuclear division.",1995,7568239,no
"Extragenic suppressors of nudC3, a mutation that blocks nuclear migration in Aspergillus nidulans.","Nuclear migration plays an important role in the growth and development of many organisms including the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. We have cloned three genes from A. nidulans, nudA, nudC, and nudF, in which mutations affect nuclear migration. The nudA gene encodes the heavy chain of cytoplasmic dynein. The nudC gene encodes a 22-kD protein. The nudF gene was identified as an extra copy suppressor of the temperature sensitive (ts-) nudC3 mutation. The nudC3 mutation substantially decreases the intracellular concentration of the nudF protein at restrictive temperature. This is restored toward the normal level by an extra copy of nudF. To identify other genes whose products interact directly or indirectly with the NUDC protein, we have isolated a set of extragenic suppressors showed them to represent nine different genes, designated sncA-sncI (for suppressor of nudC). sncA-sncH were either dominant or semidominant in diploids homozygous for nudC3 and heterozygous for the snc mutations. All of the suppressors reversed the ts- phenotype of nudC3 by restoring the intracellular concentration of the NUDF protein.",1995,8647384,no
Studies on shared antigenic/allergenic components among fungi.,"Fungal allergens have been found to be one of the most prevalent aeroallergens in India. Knowledge of shared/unique components among different fungi is necessary for proper diagnosis and treatment of patients allergic to fungi. In the present study, crude extracts (CE) of 11 common fungi (Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus flavus, Asp. fumigatus, Asp. niger, Asp. tamarii, Asp. versicolor, Cladosporium herbarum, Curvularia lunata, Mucor hiemalis, Penicillium citrinum, and Fusarium solani) were characterized by isoelectric focusing (IEF), SDS-PAGE, and immunoblot. On IEF (pI 3-9), the number of protein bands was found to be greatest (46) in M. hiemalis extract. SDS-PAGE exhibited a varied number of bands, generally 18-40, with mol. mass ranging from 14 to 100 kDa. IgG-specific immunoprint using rabbit anti-F. solani CF antibodies demonstrated a mol. mass distribution of shared antigenic proteins of 14-100 kDa in most of the fungi. Shared allergenicity was observed in a number of allergenic proteins in fungal extracts with mol. mass ranging between 14 and 70 kDa on IgE-specific immunoblot using pooled sera of patients allergic to Fusarium. A 45-kDa protein was found to be common among these fungi on immunoblot with patients as well as with rabbit antibodies. F. solani CF extract contained more antigenic/allergenic proteins than F. solani CE. It was concluded that F. solani CF shared several antigenic/allergenic components with CE of other common fungi. This fact needs to be taken into account when fungal extracts are used in diagnosis and immunotherapy of allergic patients.",1995,8607563,no

Production and use of monoclonal antibodies to Microsporum canis.,"Microsporum canis NCPF 179 and M. canis NCPF 177 dermatophyte cytoplasmic extracts (DCEs) were used as antigens to generate monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Hybridomas with supernatants of optical density (OD) > 1 for homologous dermatophyte cytoplasmic extracts (CE) and OD < 0.5 for heterologous CE of Candida albicans tested by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were selected for cloning. mAbs secreted by cloned hybridoma lines were screened against CE of M. canis, M. gypseum, M. equinum, M. distortum, Trichophyton verrucosum, C. albicans, Malassezia pachydermatis and Aspergillus fumigatus. The ELISA performed on clone supernatants identified a variety of different activities between the dermatophyte and other fungal CEs.

Aspergillus fumigatus antigens.,"Cytosolic fractions of mycelial extracts from Aspergillus nidulans, A. flavus, and three different isolates of A. fumigatus, grown to stationary phase in Czapek-Dox-AOAC medium, were tested by immunoblotting for the presence of antigens reactive to 80 serum samples from aspergilloma patients. Fifty control serum samples were used to determine the specificity of the reactions. In the A. fumigatus cytosolic fraction a group of four main antigenic bands (p90, p60, p40 and p37) was consistently recognized (in total or partial form) by 90% of the serum samples from the aspergilloma patients. This group of antigens was designated as the 'cytosolic fraction complex' (CFC). As confirmed by two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting with aspergilloma serum samples, each of the four antigenic bands is formed of several isoforms of acidic glycopeptides with slightly different pls. All the isoforms are at least N-glycosylated, as demonstrated by endoglycosidase H removal of a considerable amount of sugar residues. The relationship of these antigens with certain other A. fumigatus antigens previously reported in the literature, and their potential use in the immunodiagnosis of aspergilloma, are discussed.",1995,7582030,no

Different reactivity to recombinant Aspergillus fumigatus allergen I/a in patients with atopic dermatitis or allergic asthma sensitised to Aspergillus fumigatus.,"We report a clinical study comparing the skin test reactivity to recombinant Aspergillus fumigatus allergen 1 (rAsp fI/a) in patients with atopic dermatitis and A. fumigatus sensitisation (n = 15), A. fumigatus-allergic patients with asthma (n = 10) and healthy control subjects (n = 10). All patients sensitised to A. fumigatus reacted at intradermal skin tests with commercial A. fumigatus extracts in contrast to the healthy subjects. Six out of 10 patients with well-characterised A. fumigatus allergic asthma were sensitised to rAsp fI/a as shown by a positive skin test. The patients with skin test reactivity to rAsp fI/a also showed rAsp f I/a-specific serum IgE as determined by ELISA. None of the patients with atopic dermatitis, healthy control subjects and 4 out of 10 A. fumigatus-allergic asthmatics reacted in intradermal tests to rAsp fI/a. Serologic investigations revealed that these subjects did not express detectable amounts of rAsp fI/a-specific IgE in agreement with the negative skin test results. Extended serologic investigations have not shown significant differences in rAsp fI/a-specific IgA, IgG4 and IgG1 serum levels between atopic dermatitis patients and healthy control subjects. The results suggest that sensitisation to A. fumigatus in patients with atopic dermatitis is not related to the major A. fumigatus allergen I in contrast to the high incidence of sensitisation to Asp fI/a occurring in allergic asthmatics.",1995,7647590,no

Western blot analysis of cerebrospinal fluid for detection of Aspergillus antigens.,"Western-blot immunoassay of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens of patients with central nervous system (CNS) aspergillosis (3), CNS candidosis (1) and bacterial meningitis (2) was carried out using pooled serum from histopathologically proven deep-seated aspergillosis cases to detect unique antigenic fractions for aspergillosis in CSF. No reactivity was observed in patients with non-fungal meningitis. Four cross-reactive bands (40, 90, 200 and > 200 KD) were detectable in CSF from patients with both aspergillosis and candidosis of the CNS.

Identification of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in cystic fibrosis patients by recombinant Aspergillus fumigatus I/a-specific serology.,"Before specific therapy, such as oral corticosteroids, can be commenced it is essential to distinguish full-blown allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) from allergy to A. fumigatus in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). For this purpose we have evaluated the diagnostic value of recombinant A. fumigatus allergen I/a (rAsp f I/a)-specific serology in 55 patients with CF. Based on clinical presentation and laboratory data, 10 CF patients had ABPA, 27 had Aspergillus allergy, and 18 were not allergic to A. fumigatus (CF control group). The serologic assays revealed a 10-fold increase in rAsp fI/a-specific IgE, a 5-fold increase in rAsp fI/a-specific IgG1, and a 4-fold increase in rAsp fI/a-specific IgG4 antibodies in ABPA patients compared with the Aspergillus allergy and CF control groups. Sera from 11 CF patients were analyzed without knowledge of their clinical state or diagnosis of ABPA. All ABPA patients (4 of 11) were accurately identified. We conclude that rAsp fI/a-specific serology is a highly sensitive and specific test that can be used to identify ABPA reliably in CF patients.",1995,7633719,no
1H- and 13C-NMR characterization of the digalactosylmannopentaose liberated from legume seed galactomannan by beta-mannanase action.,"Incubation of Locust bean gum with an Aspergillus niger beta-D-mannanase released a wide variety of galactomannan oligomers. A single heptasaccharide, digalactosylmannopentaose, was obtained from fractionation of the mixture by size exclusion chromatography.

Aspergillus fumigatus somatic antigens: comparison between two methods of preparation and immunochemical characterization.,"Aspergillus fumigatus and other species of the same genus can cause different pathological processes amongst which can be found pulmonary hypersensitivity, intracavitary colonization and invasive and disseminated aspergillosis. The diagnosis of these processes is helped in a great way by the immunological response of the patient to Aspergillus antigens or by the detection of these as a metabolic product in blood and other fluids such as urine. To date, no firm agreement exists regarding the best preparation and standardization technique of aspergillar antigens, which is however the most important step towards the development of immunological diagnostic tests. In this study, two methods for the obtention of A. fumigatus somatic antigens have been compared, using 3 strains of different origins. The main differences between both antigenic extraction methods were the liquid media used for cultures (Czapek and Glucose peptone), the incubation times (4 weeks and 3 days respectively), the type of agitation during the incubation period (intermittent or continuous) and the dialysis and concentration method. The antigens obtained were standardized by the determination of the proteic and hydrocarbonate content, vertical electrophoresis in SDS PAGE, immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting against experimental antisera. From the comparison between both extraction methods, it was found that the highest proteic content was obtained with the somatic antigens of mycelium developed in Czapek for 4 weeks, whereas fungi cultivated in Glucose peptone had a higher glucide content.

The pH values of the fractions were determined and equilibrated to pH 7.2 and then analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using horseradish peroxidase enzyme system against serum specimens from dogs with blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, aspergillosis, and coccidioidomycosis. The results showed a peak absorbance at pH 3.89-4.31 (fractions 4 and 5) with the blastomycosis serum specimens. This was a single sharp peak while the rest of the fractions were lower. In contrast the sera from dogs with histoplasmosis showed a peak absorbance at pH 5.54-5.97 (fractions 9 and 10), while the other mycoses showed patterns that did not resemble the blastomycosis or histoplasmosis specimens. Serum specimens from dogs with blastomycosis being treated with itraconazole were also assayed (pre-treatment and 1, 2, 3, and 12 months post-treatment sera). The characteristic peak for blastomycosis was observed and a decrease in the peak was seen as the treatment progressed. Fractions 3-12 were also used to detect delayed dermal hypersensitivity in hyperimmunized hairless guinea-pigs. Fraction 5 (pH 4.31) elicited the optimal response in B. dermatitidis-immunized animals, while no cross-reactivity was observed in guinea-pigs sensitized with Histoplasma capsulatum killed cells.",1995,8531017,no
Sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay compared with Pastorex latex agglutination test for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients.,The performance of a direct sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting Aspergillus galactomannan was compared with that of the Pastorex Aspergillus antigen latex agglutination (LA) test by using 532 serum samples from 61 patients at risk for invasive aspergillosis. The ELISA gave positive results earlier in the course of infection than did the LA test. A sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 86% were obtained for the LA test and corresponding values of 90 and 84% were obtained for the ELISA when a series of serum samples was employed.,1995,7665670,no
Activation of the Aspergillus PacC transcription factor in response to alkaline ambient pH requires proteolysis of the carboxy-terminal moiety.,"Extremes of pH are an occupational hazard for many microorganisms. In addition to efficient pH homeostasis, survival effectively requires a regulatory system tailoring the syntheses of molecules functioning beyond the cell boundaries (permeases, secreted enzymes, and exported metabolites) to the pH of the growth environment. Our previous work established that the zinc finger PacC transcription factor mediates such pH regulation in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans in response to a signal provided by the products of the six pal genes at alkaline ambient pH. In the presence of this signal, PacC becomes functional, activating transcription of genes expressed at alkaline pH and preventing transcription of genes expressed at acidic pH. Here we detect two forms of PacC in extracts, both forming specific retardation complexes with a PacC-binding site. Under acidic growth conditions or in acidity-mimicking pal mutants (defective in ambient pH signal transduction), the full-length form of PacC predominates. Under alkaline growth conditions or in alkalinity-mimicking pacCc mutants (independent of the ambient pH signal), a proteolysed version containing the amino-terminal approximately 40% of the protein predominates. This specifically cleaved shorter version is clearly functional, both as an activator for alkaline-expressed genes and as a repressor for acid-expressed genes, but the full-length form of PacC must be inactive. Thus, PacC proteolysis is an essential and pH-sensitive step in the regulation of gene expression by ambient pH. Carboxy-terminal truncations, resulting in a gain-of-function (pacCc) phenotype, bypass the requirement for the pal signal transduction pathway for conversion of the full-length to the proteolyzed functional form.",1995,7628696,no
Soluble serum interleukin 2 receptors in patients with asthma and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"When T cells are activated, they produce two distinct surface receptors for interleukin 2 (IL2). One of these surface receptors is a 55-kD protein called IL2Ra which is released into peripheral blood following T cell activation. This soluble protein (sIL2R) can be measured in peripheral blood utilizing an ELISA, and thus provides an indirect indicator of T cell activation.The purpose of this study was to determine whether allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) was associated with increased soluble interleukin 2 receptors (sIL2R).We used the Immunoenzymometric Assay Kit (Immunotech International, Marseille, France) which had a monoclonal antibody to sIL2R to sensitize wells. To determine the degree of T cell activation in patients with asthma and ABPA, we have evaluated the concentration of sIL2R in the peripheral blood in four groups: (1) 26 nonatopic patients, (2) 39 patients skin test positive to Aspergillus who did not have serologic evidence of ABPA, (3) 14 patients with quiescent ABPA, and (4) 13 patients who had a new roentgenographic infiltrate from ABPA.The mean concentration of sIL2R in the four groups were 24.5 pM (+/- 16.7), 38.4 pM (+/- 27.2), 48.4 pM (+/- 28.2), and 64.8 pM (+/- 33.0), respectively. Group 4 was greater than groups 1 and 2 (P < .05), and group 3 was greater than group 1 (P < .05).In patients with ABPA that is flaring, there is greater T cell activation than in either nonatopic controls or in patients who have asthma. Patients with ABPA in remission also had significantly greater T cell activation than nonatopic controls.",1995,7788514,no
Cloning and expression of the carboxypeptidase gene from Aspergillus saitoi and determination of the catalytic residues by site-directed mutagenesis.,"Carboxypeptidase from Aspergillus saitoi removes acidic, neutral and basic amino acids as well as proline from the C-terminal position at pH 2-5. cpdS, a cDNA encoding A. saitoi carboxypeptidase, was cloned and expressed. Analysis of the 1816-nucleotide sequence revealed a single open reading frame coding for 523 amino acids. When A. saitoi carboxypeptidase cDNA was expressed in yeast cells, carboxypeptidase activity was detected in the cell extract and was immunostained with a 72 kDa protein with polyclonal anti-(A. saitoi carboxypeptidase) serum. The recombinant enzyme treated with glycopeptidase F migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 60 kDa on SDS/PAGE, which was the same as that of the de-N-glycosylated carboxypeptidase from A. saitoi. Site-directed mutagenesis of the cpdS indicated that Ser-153, Asp-357 and His-436 residues were essential for the enzymic catalysis. It can be concluded that A. saitoi carboxypeptidase has a catalytic triad comprising Asp-His-Ser and is a member of serine carboxypeptidase family (EC 3.4.16.1).",1995,7772020,no
Aspergillus antigen detection in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.,"The utility of serum Aspergillus antigen in invasive aspergillosis was determined by identifying patients with >50 ng/mL Aspergillus carbohydrate antigen by ELISA. Patients were identified from a university hospital over a 65-month period. Nineteen patients with antigenemia had proven invasive aspergillosis, 16 had probable invasive aspergillosis, and 14 had an indeterminate diagnosis. There were 5 patients with false-positive results. Antigen levels were higher in disseminated infection than in invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (median levels, 500 and 121 ng/mL, respectively). Survival also correlated with antigenemia. Serial samples were obtained from 31 of 35 patients with proven or probable invasive aspergillosis. Fifteen of 19 patients with rising or persistent antigenemia died, whereas only 1 of 12 patients who cleared antigenemia died. Higher antigen levels were useful in predicting disseminated disease, and the course of antigenemia correlated with clinical outcome. Antigen detection may be a useful addition in the management of invasive aspergillosis.",1995,7769291,no
Skin-prick tests for hypersensitivity to alpha-amylase preparations.,"Twenty-five asthmatic subjects with suspected alpha-amylase hypersensitivity were studied by skin-prick tests, a capture ELISA, immunoblotting and bronchial provocation tests. At the same time, different amylases were analysed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using a polyclonal rabbit antiserum. Eight patients showed a positive bronchial response to amylase. Seven of them had positive skin-prick tests, with this method being the most sensitive approach for diagnosis. However, in four cases, skin tests were also positive although the patients had a negative provocation test, thus demonstrating that skin tests are not specific. ELISA and blotting showed similar results in terms of sensitivity and specificity. The enzymes used by the workers included several antigens besides alpha-amylase. The rabbit antiserum to alpha-amylase detected a protein in a wheat flour extract. In one case, the IgE antibodies were specific only for a contaminant of lower molecular weight than amylase. These facts suggest that proteins from the culture medium could be responsible for some cases of amylase hypersensitivity, making the diagnosis difficult. The presence of amylase in another enzymatic extract, a protease produced by Aspergillus oryzae, was proved by means of skin tests and immunoblotting, thus demonstrating the allergenic properties of this enzymatic preparation.",1995,7605978,no
"Insertion into Aspergillus nidulans of functional UDP-GlcNAc: alpha 3-D- mannoside beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase I, the enzyme catalysing the first committed step from oligomannose to hybrid and complex N-glycans.","Filamentous fungi are capable of secreting relatively large amounts of heterologous recombinant proteins. Recombinant human glycoproteins expressed in this system, however, carry only carbohydrates of the oligomannose type limiting their potential use in humans. One approach to the problem is genetic engineering of the fungal host to permit production of complex and hybrid N-glycans. UDP-GlcNAc:alpha 3-D-mannoside beta- 1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GnT I) is essential for the conversion of oligomannose to hybrid and complex N-glycans in higher eukaryotic cells. Since GnT I is not produced by fungi, we have introduced into the genome of Aspergillus nidulans the gene encoding full-length rabbit GnT I and demonstrated the expression of GnT I enzyme activity at levels appreciably higher than occurs in most mammalian tissues. All the GnT I activity in the Aspergillus transformants remains intracellular suggesting that the rabbit trans-membrane sequence may be capable of targeting GnT I to the fungal Golgi apparatus.",1995,7496151,no
Sensitivity and specificity of an isoelectric focusing fraction of Blastomyces dermatitidis yeast lysate antigen for the detection of canine blastomycosis.,"Blastomyces dermatitidis yeast lysate antigen (T-58, dog isolate) fractions prepared using the Rotofor preparative isoelectric focusing (IEF) cell (Bio-Rad) were compared with B. dermatitidis yeast lysate and filtrate reagents with respect to the detection of antibodies in sera from dogs with blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis and aspergillosis. A horseradish peroxidase enzyme immunoassay with Turbo TMB substrate was used in the study. One particular IEF fraction (pH 4.3) was optimal in the assay, and it exhibited greater sensitivity (100%) and specificity (93%) than the lysate or filtrate preparations. The highest degree of cross-reactivity was encountered with the histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis specimens and considerably less with the cryptococcosis and aspergillosis sera. Studies are in progress to purify further the optimal IEF fraction.",1995,8531928,no
Highly sensitive detection of fungal antigens by ultrasound-enhanced latex agglutination.,"Treatment with ultrasound has been employed to greatly enhance the sensitivity of commercially available latex agglutination tests for fungal antigens. This 5 min procedure detects 40 pg ml-1 of Candida albicans mannan and 70 pg ml-1 of Aspergillus fumigatus galactomannan, a 250 and 500-fold improvement respectively over conventional agglutination test sensitivities. The ultrasound-enhanced test offers the possibility of improved diagnosis and management of patients with systemical candidosis or invasive aspergillosis.",1995,7666302,no
Clinical evaluation and reproducibility of the Pastorex Aspergillus antigen latex agglutination test for diagnosing invasive aspergillosis.,"The performance of the Pastorex Aspergillus antigen latex agglutination test for the detection of galactomannan in sera of patients at risk for invasive aspergillosis was evaluated, and the impact of storage on the reproducibility of the antigen titre was tested.During a one year period, 392 serum samples were obtained from 46 patients at risk for invasive aspergillosis and tested for the presence of galactomannan using an Aspergillus latex agglutination test (Pastorex). Twenty three positive serum samples which had been stored at -20 degrees C for 2-16 months were retrospectively retested. Furthermore, two positive serum samples were stored at -20 degrees C and -70 degrees C and prospectively tested at three month intervals for a period of 15 months.The Pastorex Aspergillus test was positive in eight patients with microbiological, radiological, or histological evidence for invasive aspergillosis, but was negative in the initial serum sample from five of these patients. In two patients with histological evidence for invasive aspergillosis no positive reaction was found in six samples. Six of 13 (45%) serum samples which had been stored at -20 degrees C for longer than six months had lost reactivity, while one of 10 (10%) samples had lost reactivity when stored up to six months. Two serum samples which had been stored at -20 degrees C and -70 degrees C and prospectively retested at three month intervals for 15 months, maintained stable antigen titres.The Pastorex Aspergillus test is too insensitive to diagnose invasive aspergillosis in an early stage, but may contribute to the diagnosis when cultures remain negative and serial samples are obtained. To maintain a good reproducibility, serum samples should be stored at -70 degrees C when the period of storage exceeds six months.",1995,7629297,no
Enzymatic synthesis of mannobioses and mannotrioses by reverse hydrolysis using alpha-mannosidase from Aspergillus niger.,"Various manno-oligosaccharides including alpha-D-man-(1 --> 2)-D man and alpha-D-man-(1 --> 2)-alpha-D-man-(1 --> 2)-D-man were formed when a highly concentrated mannose solution was incubated in the presence of alpha-mannosidase from Aspergillus niger. alpha-D-Man-(1 --> 2)-D-man and alpha-D- man-(1 --> 2)-alpha-D-man-(1 --> 2)-D-man were isolated by activated carbon chromatography followed by high performance liquid chromatography using an amino-silica column. In addition to the above oligosaccharides, alpha-D-man-(1 --> 3)-D-man, alpha-D-man-(1 --> 6)-D-man, and alpha-D-man-(1 --> 2)-alpha-D-man-(1 -->6)-D-man were also isolated.",1995,7585696,no
Specific antibody detection in invasive aspergillosis by analytical isoelectrofocusing and immunoblotting methods.,"Aspergillus fumigatus antigens have been tested to determine their potential as aids in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA). Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to these antigens were detected by analytical isoelectrofocusing in conjunction with immunoblotting. A total of 12 antigenic fractions, including culture filtrates and surface and mycelial extracts of A. fumigatus, were investigated. Eleven were reactive with serum specimens from patients with aspergilloma, which served as positive controls for the evaluation of a specific IgG response. Eight of 12 antigens showed good responses with serum specimens from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, which were used to assess the sensitivity of IgG detection. No measurable reactivity was detected in 18 negative control serum specimens, while 11 of 13 patients with proven, highly probable, or probable cases of IA had anti-Aspergillus IgG to multiple antigenic preparations. Patients with IA who were capable of mounting a substantial humoral response to Aspergillus antigens gave an antibody profile with five antigenic preparations which seemed to be characteristic of the disease. Data show that this method is highly sensitive and may allow the selection of fractions which are both highly antigenic and specific for the detection of antibodies to Aspergillus antigens. They also indicate that the use of a spectrum of antigenic molecules is advisable, given the variability observed in the immune responses of individual patients.",1995,7790472,no
Expression of three osmotin-like protein genes in response to osmotic stress and fungal infection in potato.,"We have characterized three cDNAs encoding osmotin-like proteins from potato (Solanum commersonii) cell cultures. These cDNAs (pA13, pA35, and pA81) have extensive nucleotide identity in the coding regions but low homology in the 3' non-coding sequences, and may encode three isoforms of potato pathogenesis-related (PR) type 5 proteins. Using gene-specific probes, RNA gel blot analyses showed constitutive accumulation of osmotin-like protein mRNAs in cell cultures, leaves, stems, roots and flowers, with high abundance in the roots and mature flowers. Treatments with abscisic acid (ABA), low temperature, and NaCl increased the accumulation of all three mRNAs in S. commersonii cell cultures and plants grown in vitro. Salicylic acid (SA), and wounding resulted in a moderate increase in the levels of pA13 and pA81 but not pA35 mRNAs. Infection with the fungus Phytophthora infestans activated strong and non-systemic expression of all three osmotin-like protein genes. The accumulation of osmotin-like proteins, however, was detected only in P. infestans-infected tissues but not in plants treated with ABA, SA, NaCl, low temperature, or wounding.",1995,7787181,no
Production and application of monoclonal antibodies specific to pyrroloquinoline quinone.,"We produced five monoclonal antibodies (mAbs 1, 2, 6, 7, and 9) that are specific to pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ). PQQ-conjugated hemocyanin was used for the immunization of mice and the hybridomas were selected using PQQ-conjugated BSA in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. MAbs 2 and 9 were of the IgG1 isotype. Both could recognize free PQQ, the former probably at the o-quinone and the latter at the opposite side of the molecule. They did not bind with trihydroxyphenylalanine, dihydroxyphenylalanine, 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene, ascorbic acid, riboflavin, or menadione. In contrast to the IgGs, mAbs 1, 6, and 7 (IgMs) did not bind with free PQQ. Using mAb 2, a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed, which enabled us to determine 50 nM-1 microM free PQQ. Furthermore, we analyzed the covalently bound prosthetic groups of two quinoproteins (amine oxidase from Aspergillus niger and amine dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida) by Western analysis using these mAbs. However, the results was negative, indicating that the prosthetic groups are not PQQ.",1995,7592546,no
Serological evidence of Aspergillus type I hypersensitivity in a subgroup of pulmonary aspergilloma patients.,"Aspergillus causes a spectrum of diseases, among which aspergilloma (saprophytic colonization) and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). We investigated the possible presence of type I hypersensitivity in patients with aspergilloma (as is classically found in ABPA). The sera of 38 patients with aspergilloma were investigated for the presence of Aspergillus-specific IgE by the CAP System (CAP) and by the RAST System (RAST). Twelve of these patients (32%) showed positive Aspergillus-specific IgE (group ASP-IgE+), with the CAP being more sensitive than the RAST. Median total IgE was higher in the ASP-IgE+ group as compared with the ASP-IgE- f1p4p (p < 0.05), but no differences were seen between the ASP-IgE+ group and patients with ABPA. Furthermore, when Alternaria-specific IgE were compared between ASP-IgE+ and ABPA groups, they were found more frequently in the latter group (p < 0.05). Thus, an aspergilloma group with type I hypersensitivity was isolated whose serologic profile to Aspergillus antigens was similar to the ABPA group. However, the patients in this group did not show sensitization to another mould (i.e., Alternaria), in contrast to the ABPA group. The presence of type I hypersensitivity in a subgroup of aspergillomas suggests an immunoallergic component to this disease which could contribute to a chronic inflammatory response to Aspergillus in some aspergillomas.",1995,7888788,no

An analysis of antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus in bovine serum by immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.,"Serum samples from 20 cows with spontaneously acquired systemic aspergillosis and serum collected consecutively from a cow with experimentally induced aspergillosis were assayed for antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus in immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Purified antigens (18 kDa protein and 20 kDa galactomannan) from A. fumigatus as well as complex preparations of metabolic and somatic antigens were used. Antibodies against A. fumigatus were found in both infected and non-infected cows. High titers and especially an increase in titer in consecutive samples signified infection. Reactivity with the 22 and 32 kDa antigens in preparations of exocellular antigens and the 19, 20, and 39 kDa antigens from intracellular antigens was seen with sera from infected cows only, and is therefore indicative of infection.",1995,7748536,no
[Fluctuations in serum antigens and antibodies in a patient with primary cutaneous aspergillosis associated with acute leukemia].,"A 5-year-old girl developed cutaneous aspergillosis due to Aspergillus flavus while undergoing remission induction therapy for acute lymphocytic leukemia. Of six serum samples obtained during the acute stage of Aspergillus infection, four showed antigenemia (6.5-22.9 ng/ml) determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). However, five serum samples obtained after treatment with amphotericin B and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor showed negative results for antigens. Sera obtained on day 17 after the detection of skin lesions showed seroconversion in precipitin antibody determined by an immunodiffusion test and in immunoglobulin (Ig) A class antibody determined by ELISA, while sera obtained on day 24 showed seroconversion of IgG and IgM class antibodies. The patient achieved complete remission of leukemia and was discharged on the 92nd day of hospitalization. No signs of disseminated or deep-seated fungal infections were present during the hospitalization. Assays for serum antigens may be of value for the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. Moreover, persistently negative results for antigens in accordance with antibody responses may correlate with recovery from the infection.",1995,7745300,no
A new sensitive sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect galactofuran in patients with invasive aspergillosis.,"A double-direct sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that uses a rat anti-galactomannan monoclonal antibody as the acceptor and detector antibody was designed. This immunoassay, which detects less than 1 ng of galactomannan per ml, was assessed in a retrospective study with samples from patients with invasive aspergillosis. Serum is more appropriate than urine for use in the search for circulating galactomannan. Antigenemia does not have a transient character.

[Pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine resistant cerebral toxoplasmosis in AIDS].,"A 48-year-old man with known HIV infection for 4 years was admitted with a 2-week history of increasing brachio-facial paraesthesiae of the left side of the body and pains in the head and neck. Physical examination also showed discrete slowing of mental activity and oral candidiasis. Toxoplasmosis serology showed a low titre with a borderline IgM titre. Cranial computer tomography showed two confluent contrast medium concentrating foci in the region of the head of the caudate nucleus and the right internal capsule. Because toxoplasmosis encephalitis was suspected, treatment was started with sulfadiazine (1 g four times daily), pyrimethamine (25 mg four times daily), folic acid (15 mg daily) and dexamethasone (8 mg three times daily). After 19 days of treatment there was no clinical improvement, and a check CT scan showed worsening with increased oedema of the cerebellar medulla, compression of the lateral ventricles and a mid-line shift of 5 mm. Since the Sabin-Feldman test titre had increased, and there was no evidence to suggest a lymphoma or a viral or fungal infection, toxoplasmosis resistant to standard therapy was postulated, and treatment was started with clindamycin (600 mg three times daily) and pyrimethamine (25 mg four times daily). The clinical features subsided within 4 days. A further check CT scan 14 days later showed almost complete resolution.",1995,7828463,no

Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis: serologic update for 1995.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a complex disease occurring in 1-2% of patients with asthma involving hypersensitivity to Aspergillus species. The diagnosis is made correlating clinical history and supporting serologic tests. Over many years various serologic tests have been used to both diagnose and follow disease activity. Initial serology from patients with all four positive tests (total serum IgE, IgE and IgG antibody indices, serum precipitins to Aspergillus fumigatus) were compared with the patients' most recent serology. The total serum IgE, IgE antibody index and serum precipitins had the most initial positive tests which stayed positive throughout treatment. The IgG antibody index was the most inconsistent. There were no significant differences between all four tests. We concluded that all four serologic tests are important in the diagnosis of ABPA.",1995,8926621,no
Natural co-occurrence of Fusarium toxins and aflatoxin B1 in corn for feed in north Vietnam.,"Natural occurrence of Fusarium mycotoxins (trichothecenes and fumonisins) and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) were surveyed in 32 corn samples, harvested in 1993 and randomly sampled in 1994 in several districts of Hanoi, Vietnam. Corn samples were first milled into fine powder, extracted with methanol-water (3:1) and the crude extracts obtained from the same samples were used for the simultaneous analysis of the trichothecenes such as nivalenol (NIV), deoxynivalenol (DON), and T-2 toxin (T-2) by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/NS) fumonisins B1 (FB1), B2 (FB2), and B3 (FB3) by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a flourescence detector",1995,8612007,no
[Emergency lung resections for invasive aspergillosis in neutropenic patients].,"Mortality due to Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis (IPA) remains high in neutropenic patients due to pulmonary haemorrhage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the emergency surgical management of IPA. Seven neutropenic patients, with a mean age of 47 years (range: 30-64) (4 women and 3 men) were treated for (6 cases) acute leukaemia one Myeloma (1 case). Presumptive diagnosis of IPA was based on: Halo sign (n = 6) or air-crescent sign (n = 1) on CT scan, positive serology (n = 4), positive antigenemia (n = 3) and positive broncho-alveolar lavage (n = 1). In 2 cases, IPA diagnosis was only based on CT scan. In all cases, aspergillosis lesions were located near the left (n = 5) or right (n = 2) pulmonary artery. The type of pulmonary resection was: left superior lobectomy in 3 cases, left superior lobectomy and Fowler's segmentectomy in 1 case, Left inferior lobectomy in 1 case, right superior lobectomy in 1 case and middle lobectomy and paracardiac segmentectomy. Sleeve resection of the pulmonary artery was performed in two patients. There were no deaths or major postoperative complications. Mean hospital stay after surgery was 12 days (rang: 8-19).

Improved detection of medically important fungi by immunoperoxidase staining with polyclonal antibodies.,"This study was performed to identify pathological fungi of eight species [Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, Torulopsis (Candida) glabrata, Cryptococcus neoformans, Fusarium anthophilum, Rhizopus oryzae, Sporothrix schenckii and Trichosporon beigelii] in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections by indirect immunoperoxidase staining. Mature albino rabbits were immunized with formalin-killed organisms. Antibodies were prepared by precipitation. Immunoperoxidase staining was applied to the paraffin-embedded tissue sections of experimentally infected mice and human autopsy and surgical specimens. Although the cell walls of each fungus stained clearly, many cross-reactivities appeared.

"(1-->3)-beta-D-glucan in culture fluid of fungi activates factor G, a limulus coagulation factor.","Two well-known polysaccharides, (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan and mannan, are major structural components of the fungus cell wall. The G test is a direct method to measure (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan using a (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan-sensitive component, factor G, fractionated from the limulus lysate. The concentration of (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan in culture supernatants of Candida albicans increased to 1,390.0 pg/ml at 24 hours. The concentration of mannan also increased parallel with fungal growth. However, after digestion of supernatants with endo-(1-->3)-beta-D-glucanase, the reactivity to factor G disappeared, although titers of antimannan monoclonal antibody-based latex agglutination were unchanged. Our study demonstrated that cell suspensions of both C. albicans and Cryptoccocus neoformans activated the limulus factor G, and that not only the conidia form but also the filamentous form of Aspergillus fumigatus reacted with factor G. Various Candida spp. (C. paraspilosis, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. krusei), Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rhodotorula rubra, Trichosporon beigelii, and A. fumigatus released soluble (1-->3)-beta-D-glucan into their culture supernatants, but C. neoformans and Cunninghamella bertholletiae showed only a small reaction to the G test during their culture. Our results indicate that the G test is a good method for serodiagnosis of deep mycosis and also as a screening tool for contamination of medical devices, drugs, and experimental materials with (1 --> 3)-beta-D-glucan.",1995,8531015,no
Serologic monitoring of disease and treatment in a patient with pulmonary aspergilloma.,"Disease progression and efficacy of fungistatic treatment in pulmonary aspergilloma (PA) are difficult to monitor. The usefulness of chest tomography, IgG-ELISA serology, double immunodiffusion, and IgG-immunoblotting was assessed in monitoring disease progression and efficacy of itraconazole treatment during a 9-yr follow-up of a patient with two exacerbations of PA. A rise in IgG-ELISA titer coincided with a recrudescence of clinical symptoms, whereas a decrease after treatment paralleled clinical improvement. IgG-binding to a 32-kD serine protease and to 60- and 94-kD proteins produced with collagen-containing culture medium closely corresponded with IgG-ELISA titers. IgG-binding to a 40-kD metalloprotease remained at very low levels until symptoms and fungal growth became well advanced, when a sharp rise was seen. Responses to all antigens rapidly diminished after the start of successful treatment with itraconazole. Serology may be a useful adjunct in the monitoring of disease progression and the efficacy of itraconazole treatment in patients with PA. IgG-binding to individual fungal proteins shows subtle differences in kinetics. Immunologic responses to fungal proteases raised with collagen-containing culture media may reflect fungal proteolytic involvement during disease progression and treatment more closely than responses to proteins raised with conventional media.",1995,7812553,no
Immunochemical identification of fungi using polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits to exoantigens from Aspergillus ochraceus.,"Aspergillus ochraceus Wilhelm is a producer of highly toxic mycotoxin, ochratoxin A, and is known to contribute to the damage of grain on storage. Rabbit antibodies were produced against the exoantigens of A. ochraceus, and ELISA and immunoblotting procedures were used to characterize their reactivity towards fungal exoantigens of four Aspergillus, seven Penicillium, three Fusarium, one Mucor and one Alternaria species. The antibodies were specific for A. ochraceus and essentially cross-reacted neither with other fungi nor with the water-soluble grain components. These antibodies, therefore, have the potential of being utilized for the discriminative monitoring of A. ochraceus in foodstuffs and feeds.",1995,7765866,no
Detection of (1-3)-beta-D-glucan in a rat model of aspergillosis.,"The G test containing factor G, fractioned from the Limulus lysate, was used to detect (1-3)-beta-D-glucan in a rat model of aspergillosis. Aspergillus fumigatus strain MF-13, 1 x 10(4) conidia, were inoculated transtracheally into rats treated with cortisone acetate (100 mg/kg) and fed a low-protein (8%) diet. Increased serum (1-3)-beta-D-glucan was found on the sixth day after inoculation in concentrations of 370 +/- 178 pg/ml (mean +/- SD) in untreated controls, and 154 +/- 43 pg/ml in rats treated with 0.5 mg/kg of amphotericin B. On day 11 (1-3)-beta-D-glucan concentrations were 2,590 +/- 2,940 pg/ml and 448 +/- 442 pg/ml, respectively. The elevation in levels of (1-3)-beta-D-glucan increased in correlation with the elevation of galactomannan antigen titers (1-3)-beta-D-glucan is thus measurable during experimental aspergillosis in rats.",1995,7714664,no
Antigens of Aspergillus fumigatus produced in vivo.,"Immunoblots of extracts from kidneys of mice infected intravenously with Aspergillus fumigatus were probed with human sera from patients with aspergilloma. A limited number of antigens were detected with molecular masses of 31, 36, 56, 84, 88 and 200 kDa. These antigens can be clustered into two classes: (i) galactomannan and/or galactofuran-containing glycoproteins and (ii) antigenic proteins (31, 36 and 88 kDa) exempt of the galactofuran epitope. Antigens belonging to this second class were also produced in vitro but were not the major proteins expressed by A. fumigatus in a glucose-asparagin medium.",1995,7650587,no
Chemical and immunological characterization of the extracellular galactomannan of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"The galactomannan (GM) produced extracellularly by Aspergillus fumigatus has been purified by a double sequential hydrazine-nitrous acid treatment of the ethanol precipitate of the culture filtrate. Nuclear magnetic resonance and gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis have been performed on intact GM, acid-hydrolyzed GM, and oligomers resulting from the acetolysis of the acid-hydrolyzed GM. Results show that A. fumigatus GM is composed of a linear mannan core with an alpha-(1-2)-linked mannotetraose repeating unit attached via alpha-(1-6) linkage. Side chains composed of an average of 4 to 5 beta-(1-5)-galactofuranose units are linked to C-6 and C-3 positions of alpha-(1-2)-linked mannose units of the mannan. The immunoreactivity of GM and HCl-hydrolyzed GM was studied by use of human sera from aspergillosis patients and an antigalactofuran monoclonal antibody. The alpha-(1-2) (1-6)-mannan core is not antigenic. The immunogenic galactofuran is found amongst several exocellular glycoproteins. According to a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with GM as the detector antigen, only 26% of the serum samples from aspergilloma patients (all positive by immunodiffusion assays) give optical density values superior to a cutoff estimated as the mean +/- 3 standard deviations of values obtained with control sera.",1994,7960122,no
Display of expression products of cDNA libraries on phage surfaces. A versatile screening system for selective isolation of genes by specific gene-product/ligand interaction.,"Techniques for cloning cDNAs from bacteriophage libraries immobilised on solid supports are well established. However, these techniques do not allow selective enrichment of clones expressing proteins of interest. Screening of cDNA libraries would be simplified if the proteins encoded by cDNAs could be expressed on the surface of phage. Phage carrying genes encoding proteins for which a ligand is available can be selected directly by affinity interaction [Crameri, R. & Suter, M. (1993) Gene (Amst.) 137, 69-75]. The expression products from a cDNA library from Aspergillus fumigatus have been displayed on the surface of the filamentous phage M13 and screened for gene products binding to human serum IgE. The physical linkage of cDNA-encoded proteins to the genetic information required for their production, achieved by exploiting the high-affinity interaction of the Jun and Fos leucine zippers, allows screening of up to 1 x 10(10) independent clones in 50-microliters aliquots applied to a well of a microtiter plate coated with the ligand. Phage displaying IgE-binding proteins were selectively enriched 10(5)-10(6)-fold over non-specific phage after six rounds of growth and selection. The apparent molecular mass of the proteins selected from the cDNA library was in the range 20-40 kDa. Restriction enzyme analysis and preliminary sequence determination of 12 selected inserts revealed different sequences. The ability of the proteins to bind to human serum IgE was corroborated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and by Western-blot analysis. The developed cloning strategy allows isolation of cDNAs encoding proteins for which a ligand is available and circumvents immobilisation of the libraries on solid-phase supports which hamper selective enrichment of clones expressing the desired protein.",1994,7957259,no
"Avenacosidase from oat: purification, sequence analysis and biochemical characterization of a new member of the BGA family of beta-glucosidases.","A protein consisting of 60 kDa subunits (As-P60) was isolated from etiolated oat seedlings (Avena sativa L.) and characterized as avenacosidase, a beta-glucosidase that belongs to a preformed defence system of oat against fungal infection. The enzyme is highly aggregated it consists of 300-350 kDa aggregates and multimers thereof. Dissociation by freezing/thawing leads to complete loss of enzyme activity. The specificity of the enzyme was investigated with para-nitrophenyl derivatives which serve as substrates, in decreasing order beta-fucoside, beta-glucoside, beta-galactoside, beta-xyloside. The corresponding orthonitrophenyl glycosides are less well accepted. No hydrolysis was found with alpha-glycosides and beta-thioglucoside. An anti-As-P60 antiserum was prepared and used for isolation of a cDNA clone coding for As-P60. A presequence of 55 amino acid residues was deduced from comparison of the cDNA sequence with the N-terminal sequence determined by Edman degradation of the mature protein. The presequence has the characteristics of a stroma-directing signal peptide",1994,8000004,no
Structural and functional analysis of the nor-1 gene involved in the biosynthesis of aflatoxins by Aspergillus parasiticus.,"The nor-1 gene was cloned previously by complementation of a mutation (nor-1) in Aspergillus parasiticus SU-1 which blocked aflatoxin B1 biosynthesis, resulting in the accumulation of norsolorinic acid (NA). In this study, the nucleotide sequences of the cDNA and genomic DNA clones encompassing the coding region of the nor-1 gene were determined. The transcription initiation and polyadenylation sites of nor-1 were located by primer extension and RNase protection analyses and by comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the nor-1 genomic and cDNA clones. A plasmid, pNA51-82, was created for one-step disruption of the nor-1 gene by inserting a functional copy of the nitrate reductase (niaD) gene from A. parasiticus into the coding region of the nor-1 gene. Transformation of A. parasiticus NR-3 (niaD Afl+) with pNA51-82 resulted in niaD+ transformants that accumulated NA and produced reduced levels of aflatoxin as determined by thin-layer chromatography and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses of extracts from mycelia and the growth medium. Southern analysis of genomic DNA isolated from the NA-accumulating transformants indicated that the wild-type nor-1 gene in the chromosome had been replaced by the nonfunctional allele carried on pNA51-82. This recombinational inactivation event provides direct evidence that the nor-1 gene is functionally involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis. Comparison of the predicted nor-1 amino acid sequence with sequences in the GenBank and EMBL databases suggested that the protein is a member of the family of short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases, consistent with its proposed function as a keto reductase.",1994,7993094,no
[Spontaneous course of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis].,"This case report illustrates the spontaneous course of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). The x-ray images cover a time-frame of nearly 20 years. All of the main criteria of ABPA are fulfilled. Despite intermittent oral corticosteroid treatment, recurrent eosinophilic infiltrates of the lungs occurred. New strategies in diagnosis and treatment of ABPA are discussed.",1994,7973517,no
Comparison of three in vitro assays for serum IgE with skin testing in asthmatic children.,"The diagnostic performance of three commercial assay kits [Phadezym RAST (PhRAST), Pharmacia CAP system (CAP), and multiple chemiluminescent assay (CLA-MAST)] for measuring serum-specific IgE was evaluated and compared using intradermal skin testing or skin prick testing as reference standards. Serum samples were obtained from allergic patients who were tested with either intradermal skin tests or skin prick tests (96 and 49 subjects, respectively). Six different allergen extracts were tested: Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus, short ragweed, Bermuda grass, and cockroach mix. Results showed that when using intradermal skin testing as a reference standard, the CLA-MAST had the lowest sensitivity (75%), specificity (80%), and efficiency (85%) but the Pharmacia CAP system achieved the highest sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency (86%, 94%, and 91%, respectively). When compared with these two relatively new assays, the Phadezym RAST had medium sensitivity (80%), specificity (92%), and efficiency (88%). In contrast, when using skin prick testing as a reference standard, the highest specificity was achieved by Phadezym RAST (95%), followed by Pharmacia CAP system (90%), and MAST (81%). As for the sensitivity of each test, the Phadezym RAST was the lowest (60%) and Pharmacia CAP system reached the highest sensitivity (79%) and for the efficiency test, the score was 87% for CAP, 83% for Phadezym RAST, and 75% for MAST. These results suggest, therefore, that the CAP system is the preferred test and provides a useful guide for prescription of environmental control and immunotherapy in unselected patients.",1994,7944001,no
Aplastic anemia after liver transplantation for fulminant liver failure.,"We determined the incidence and outcome of aplastic anemia among 56 patients who underwent liver transplantation for fulminant liver failure at the University of Nebraska Medical Center between July 1985 and December 1993. Aplastic anemia developed in 6 of 18 (33%) children and 1 of 19 (5%) adults who had fulminant non-A, non-B hepatitis no cases of aplastic anemia occurred among patients with other causes of fulminant liver failure. None of these patients had evidence of a preexisting hematological disorder or infection with hepatitis C virus (as determined with a second-generation ELISA). Aplastic anemia was diagnosed at a median of 4 wk after the onset of hepatitis, with five cases seen before transplantation. Six patients received antithymocyte globulin to promote remission of aplastic anemia. Three children died (fungal infection in two, intracranial hemorrhage in one)--one at 43, one at 108 and one at 119 days after transplantation--without remission of aplastic anemia. Among the four surviving patients, with median follow-up of 25 mo, complete and partial remission of aplastic anemia have occurred in three and one, respectively. Liver allograft function is stable in all surviving patients. The data demonstrate that aplastic anemia is a common complication among children who undergo liver transplantation for fulminant non-A, non-B hepatitis. It is associated with a high rate of mortality, although most survivors appear to have full hematological recovery.",1994,7927220,no
"Purification and characterization of a ribonuclease from Aspergillus giganteus IFO 5818, the gigantin. Immunological and enzymic comparison with alphasarcin.","A protein has been isolated from a culture medium of Aspergillus giganteus IFO 5818 (gigantin) and purified by ion-exchange chromatography successively on DEAE-cellulose and carboxymethyl-cellulose, and gel-filtration chromatography on Biogel P10. With a high purity, gigantin was found to be a non-glycosylated basic protein with a relative molecular mass of 17000 +/- 200 determined in PAGE/SDS. Gigantin was able to digest the synthetic homopolymers of nucleic acids poly(A), poly(I), poly(C) and poly(U). The catalytic action has an optimal pH around 7.0, an optimal temperature at 45-55 degrees C and can be inhibited by cations. Gigantin activity, analyzed as its capacity to hydrolyze RNA from yeast, was comparable to that of alphasarcin, a similar biochemical protein produced by the strain A. giganteus MDH 18894. A study of the substrate specificity for alphasarcin indicated a preference for poly(A) and poly(I), while gigantin had greater activity on poly(C) and poly(U). The cross reaction of gigantin with a rabbit antiserum to alphasarcin suggests a high sequence similarity between both proteins. However, gigantin is immunologically distinguishable from alphasarcin as alphasarcin antiserum detects epitopes in alphasarcin that are not present in gigantin.",1994,7925444,no
Fungal colonization of untreated peptic ulcer.,"To evaluate the relationship between Candida and peptic ulcer.One hundred consecutive patients with untreated peptic ulcer (81 with duodenal ulcer and 19 with gastric ulcer) were studied using histopathology, culture and fungal serology. Twenty subjects with non-ulcer dyspepsia were taken as controls.Forty seven patients (47%) with peptic ulcer were colonized by Candida as compared to 3 patients (15%) with non ulcer dyspepsia (p < 0.05). Confluent growth of Candida on culture of gastric aspirate or biopsy from ulcer edge was a more sensitive method for diagnosis of peptic ulcer-associated candidiasis than histological examination. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of Candida isolation in relation to age or sex of the patients, smoking habit and alcoholism. Large ulcers (> 2 cm) were, however, more often colonized by Candida (75%) than smaller ones (43%) (p < 0.05). Candida albicans was the commonest species isolated (60%). Invasive candidiasis was associated with Candida agglutinin titer of 1:128 in 81% of cases.Candida colonization rate in peptic ulcer is significantly higher than in non-ulcer dyspepsia.",1994,7829139,no
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis: a retrospective study of 35 cases.,"Clinical profile of 35 patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) was analysed. The disease was found to be more frequent among females. Constitutional symptoms, expectoration, increased breathless and poor control of asthma were the main presenting features. Skin reactivity against aspergillin and Candida was positive in 30 and 2 cases, respectively. Precipitating antibodies against Aspergillus species was positive in 28 cases, and against Candida albicans in 2 cases. Sputum grew either Aspergillus or C. albicans or both in 19 patients. Absolute eosinophilia was observed only in one third of cases. Chest skiagram revealed characteristic central/proximal bronchiectasis and/or fleeting shadows in all cases. No specific pattern was observed on spirometry. There was no correlation between the duration of bronchial asthma, sputum culture and serology results. Most patients responded well to steroids. One striking feature of the study was that one third of the cases were misdiagnosed as pulmonary tuberculosis and were treated with antitubercular drugs for varying periods of time. A high index of clinical suspicion with appropriate laboratory tests are required to identify these cases.",1994,7774963,no
Production of aflatoxin and cyclopiazonic acid by various aspergilli: An ELISA analysis.,"An enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to monitor a total of 153 fungi in theAspergillus flavus group, Including 130A. flavus, 15A. parasiticus and 8A. tamarii, for their ability to produce aflatoxins (AFs) and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) in a mycologlcal broth-sucrose-yeast extract medium. Of 15A. parasiticus isolates, ten produced AFs In a range of 12.4 to 89.3 μg/vial (average 56.9 μg/vial) two isolates produced only trace amounts of AFs and three isolates produced none at all. Production of CPA was not demonstrated in anyA. parasiticus isolate. On the other hand, all A. tamarii isolates produced only CPA with a range of 310 to 1100 gmg/vial. Fifteen percent (14.6%) of theA. flavus isolates (19/130) produced more than 500 μg CPA/vial, but yielded no or little AF (less than 0.1 μg/vial). About 22.3% ofA. flavus (29/130) that produced less than 500 μg of CPA also yielded little or no aflatoxin. MostA. flavus isolates (44.6%) produced both CPA (50 to 300 μg/vial) and AFs (10 to 40 μg/vial). About 9.2% of theA. flavus are low CPA producers (less than 100 μg/vial) but yielded higher amounts of AFs. A small percentage (12/130 or 9.2%) of A. flavus isolates produced neither CPA nor aflatoxin. Excluding the isolates that produced neither AFs nor CPA, there is a negative correlation between the production of CPA and AFs by most A.flavus isolates. Data obtained from ELISA for the production of CPA were consistent with TLC results. Thus, the ELISA method for CPA and AFB could be applied to the screening of toxigenic fungi. Data on the simultaneous production of both toxins by a large percentage of the toxigenicA. flavus isolates suggest that there is a potential health hazard for co-existence of both toxins in foods and feeds.",1994,23605971,no
[Specific antigens and antibodies in invasive aspergillosis].,"Early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis is of utmost importance but difficult to achieve. Serological methods were developed mainly because all the other diagnostic approaches had major drawbacks. The detection of antibodies against Aspergillus antigens provided little interesting information, since anti-Aspergillus antibodies were commonly found in healthy people, while, on the other hand, immunocompromised patients often failed to raise antibodies. Several groups of investigators showed that the detection in serum or urine by RIA or ELISA of Aspergillus antigens, was a highly specific indication of invasive disease. The sensitivities of the techniques, however, were moderate, partially due to the low antigen concentrations and the transient character of antigenemia. The only commercially available test is a latex agglutination test detecting 15 ng/ml galactomannan. It has a high specificity but reported sensitivities varied between 42% and 94.7%. Results with an experimental double-sandwich ELISA detecting about 1 ng/ml galactomannan suggest that the improvement of detection limit also greatly increases the clinical value of the test: patients become and remain positive 2 to 10 weeks earlier. If these results are confirmed, antigen detection could become a essential element in the management of an immunocompromised patient population.",1994,7877862,no
Value of antigen and antibody detection in the serological diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in patients with hematological malignancies.,"In a study to determine the value of antigen and antibody detection in the serological diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in patients with hematological malignancies, 436 sequential serum samples from 79 neutropenic patients were tested. Circulating galactomannan antigen was detected with a latex agglutination method (Pastorex Aspergillus) and antibody to Aspergillus fumigatus with an immunodiffusion test on agar gel. Among the 79 patients 18 cases of invasive aspergillosis were detected (4 proven, 6 highly probable, 3 probable, 5 suspected). Antigen was detected in 7 of these 18 patients. The sensitivity of the antigen test was 38.8% and the specificity 95%. The antibody test showed 55.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity. In this study the antigen test was less sensitive than previously reported but highly specific and might serve as a supplementary diagnostic test.",1994,7843181,no
"Comparative evaluation of the Premier enzyme immunoassay, micro-immunodiffusion and complement fixation tests for the detection of Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum antibodies.","A total of 178 sera, including 68 from proven cases of histoplasmosis (65 positive for the presence of Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum antibodies and three positive for antigen), 93 from patients with suspected histoplasmosis but with no laboratory evidence of H. capsulatum var. capsulatum infection, 14 from humans with heterologous fungal and non-fungal infections and three from normal individuals, were tested for IgG H. capsulatum antibodies and M or M and H precipitins by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (Meridian Diagnostics, Cincinnati, OH, USA) and microimmunodiffusion (MID) respectively. Sixty-three of the 68 histoplasmosis case sera demonstrated IgG antibody, and 65 of 68 demonstrated the presence of specific precipitins in the MID test. Nine positive case sera, when tested with the Laboratory Branch complement fixation (LBCF) test, reacted positively to whole yeast and histoplasmin antigens (titres 1:8 to 1:512). Three histoplasmosis case sera repeatedly tested negative for IgG, specific precipitins and complement-fixing antibodies, whereas they were positive for Histoplasma antigen. Eighteen of 95 sera from patients without evidence of histoplasmosis demonstrated IgG antibody in the EIA only. Among these positive sera, three out of three cases of aspergillosis and three out of five cases of blastomycosis were confirmed. Sera from HIV-infected and healthy individuals did not show IgG or M and/or H antibodies to H. capsulatum. Ninety-three sera were negative by both EIA and MID. The EIA for IgG was less sensitive (97%) than MID (100%). The specificity of EIA and MID was 84% and 100% respectively.",1994,7746288,no
Analysis of IgG subclass and IgE response in allergic disease caused by Aspergillus fumigatus by immunoblotting techniques.,"Analysis of sera from patients suffering from allergic asthma, extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA) due to Aspergillus fumigatus or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) by means of IEF immunoprint and Western blot showed characteristic IgG subclasses and IgE responses. Asthmatic patients revealed specific IgE antibodies. IgG subclass reactivities in asthmatics and healthy blood donors were weak and uncharacteristic. Major allergens recognized by asthmatic patients have isoelectric points (pI) of pI 4.4 and 4.8 and molecular weights of 20, 29, 34, 38 and 45 kD. Patients suffering from EAA typically demonstrated strong IgG subclass reactivities with an emphasis to IgG1 and IgG2, while no specific IgE was found. Various major antigens could be identified. Reaction to a pI 6.0 antigen seemed to be characteristic for EAA. ABPA patients showed strong reactivities of all IgG subclasses and of IgE. An intense IgG4 reaction appeared as a typical marker for ABPA. Several major antigens and allergens could be determined. Especially the IgG4 reactivities to proteins with pI 4.6, 5.0, 5.2, 5.4 and 6.5 and molecular weights of 14, 20, 29, 34, 38 and 45 kD seemed to be a characteristic pattern in ABPA. Furthermore, IgE antibodies to culture filtrate components of 34 and 38 kD appeared to be typical in ABPA.",1994,8038618,no
A new methionine antagonist that has antifungal activity: mode of action.,"A new antifungal, azoxybacilin (an unusual amino acid with an azoxy moiety) was identified from Bacillus cereus, and its in vitro antifungal activity and mode of action were investigated. Azoxybacilin was active against a broad spectrum of fungi. It was especially active against mycelial fungi, such as Aspergillus, and did not show antibacterial activity. No cross-resistance with antifungals currently on the market was observed. The IC50 values of azoxybacilin antifungal activity against Saccharomyces cerevisiae were significantly greater when amino acids containing sulfur were added to the growth medium, whereas other amino acids were not effective at all. We, therefore, tested the effect of the intermediates involved in the synthetic pathway of these amino acids. The activity markedly diminished when one of the following four intermediates was present in the medium:homocysteine, cysteine, cystathionine or methionine. These four intermediates were the same as those required for the growth of the O-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase mutant, S. cerevisiae ONO726, indicating that azoxybacilin would inhibit a step or steps in the sulfur-fixation pathway.",1994,7928678,no
Retrospective evaluation of a latex agglutination test for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients.,"A commercial latex agglutination (LA) test for the detection of circulating Aspergillus galactomannan was evaluated in sera obtained from 121 immunocompromised patients, including 19 with proven invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Patient urine (the specimen of choice for detection of galactomannan) was not tested with the LA test as 34 of 81 specimens from controls gave false-positive results. The sensitivity (95%), specificity (90%) and negative predictive value (99%) of the LA test were similar to previously published results obtained with two EIAs. However, the positive predictive value was only 67% compared to > or = 95% obtained with the EIAs. In addition, the LA test was also of less value than the EIAs in predicting the onset of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. It was the earliest indicator of infection in only 1 of 19 proven cases.",1994,7813502,no
Effects of histoplasmin M antigen chemical and enzymatic deglycosylation on cross-reactivity in the enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot method.,"The enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB) method was evaluated as a suitable method for detecting antibodies against M antigen of Histoplasma capsulatum by use of both glycosylated and deglycosylated M protein of histoplasmin (HMIN). Sera from patients with histoplasmosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, and aspergillosis were tested by the EITB with glycosylated M protein of HMIN. This assay demonstrated 100% sensitivity with histoplasmosis serum samples, all of which reacted with the 94-kDa glycoprotein (M antigen). Although the EITB is highly sensitive, it is not specific for histoplasmosis when glycosylated M protein is used as an antigen. A total of 81% of paracoccidioidomycosis, 25% of blastomycosis, 33% of coccidioidomycosis, 73% of aspergillosis, and 16% of tuberculosis serum samples cross-reacted with M protein of HMIN and yielded patterns indistinguishable from those obtained with histoplasmosis serum samples. The EITB reactions with both untreated M antigen and M antigen altered by periodate oxidation or by deglycosylation with endoglycosidases were compared. Cross-reactions with heterologous sera in the EITB could be attributed to periodate-sensitive carbohydrate epitopes, as reflected by the increase in the test specificity from 46.1 to 91.2% after periodate treatment of M protein. The EITB for the detection of antibodies to M antigen is a potential diagnostic test for histoplasmosis, provided that periodate-treated M protein is used as an antigen.",1994,8556474,no
Granulomatous lymphadenitis caused by Coccidioides immitis.,"The dimorphic fungus Coccidioides immitis is endemic to regions of the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Central America. The mycelial form is highly infectious and is carried in dust, which is inhaled. The lung is primarily affected. The disease caused by this organism ranges from an asymptomatic form to the disseminated or progressive type. Diagnosis hinges on identification of fungal infection by means of biopsy, culture, serology, or skin testing. Each method has advantages and pitfalls. This report discusses a case of granulomatous lymphadenitis caused by C immitis which was diagnosed in the eastern United States by means of a lymph node biopsy.",1994,8083067,no
Aspergillus antigenuria compared to antigenemia in bone marrow transplant recipients.,"The detection of galactomannan antigen in urine was investigated in 26 bone marrow transplant recipients using an Aspergillus latex agglutination test (Pastorex). After modification of the method, which was originally devised for serum testing, the detection limit in native urine was approximately 20 ng/ml. Antigen was found in 79 (36.4%) of 217 serial urine samples, compared to 40 (11.8%) of 340 serum samples. As a rule, antigenuria preceded antigenemia and was more persistent. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of antigenuria for autopsy-proven aspergillosis and clinically suspected Aspergillus infection were 57%, 53%, 31% and 77%, respectively, while those of antigenemia were 43%, 53%, 25% and 71%. It is concluded that urine testing is more reliable than serum testing for the detection of Aspergillus galactomannan. The detection of antigen, however, whether in serum or in urine, allows no clear distinction between Aspergillus infection and exposure to non-infectious Aspergillus antigens.",1994,7805687,no
Serological responses induced in mice by immunogenic proteins and by protein respiratory allergens.,"It is known that a variety of materials, including both low molecular weight chemicals and proteins, is able to induce occupational respiratory allergy. We have shown previously that exposure of mice to chemical respiratory sensitizers results in both a marked increase in the serum concentration of IgE and the appearance of specific IgE antibody. In the present study we have examined the characteristics of immune responses induced in mice following intraperitoneal exposure to 3 protein respiratory allergens, ovalbumin (OVA), a lipase from Aspergillus oryzae (LP) and an amylase from Bacillus subtilis (AM) and to a fourth protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), which is considered usually not to cause respiratory sensitization. Under conditions where all proteins provoked IgG antibody responses, only OVA, LP and AM elicited specific IgE antibody. As judged by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) assay, BSA failed to induce an IgE response. In contrast to chemical respiratory sensitizers, the protein allergens examined here failed to cause a substantial increase in the serum concentration of IgE OVA and AM induced no increase in serum IgE and LP only a comparatively modest increase relative to control values. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that while protein respiratory allergens are able to provoke specific IgE antibody, they fail to cause a marked increase in the concentration of this immunoglobulin in the sera of treated mice. It would appear, therefore, that the mouse IgE test, which seeks to evaluate chemical respiratory sensitization potential as a function of induced changes in the concentration of serum IgE, will be inappropriate for the identification of protein respiratory allergens. Nevertheless, identification of protein allergens may be possible by exploiting the observations reported here that such proteins induce in mice specific IgE antibody responses.",1994,7518969,no
Particulate Aspergillus fumigatus antigens elicit a TH2 response in BALB/c mice.,"In order to understand the immunoregulation in allergic aspergillosis, a murine model was developed by exposing animals to particulate and soluble antigens of Aspergillus fumigatus.BALB/c mice were exposed to soluble Aspergillus antigen intranasally. Animals showing moderate levels of IgE were subsequently exposed to soluble antigen or antigen conjugated to polystyrene beads intranasally. The IgE and IgG1 in the sera and the eosinophils in the blood and lungs were studied. The spleen and lung mononuclear cells were stimulated with both concanavalin A and antigen and evaluated for production of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-10, and interferon-gamma.Animals exposed to particulate antigens showed more elevated serum IgE levels and increased numbers of eosinophils in the blood and lungs than those exposed to soluble antigen. Lung cell cultures from animals exposed to particulate antigens when stimulated with Aspergillus produced IL-4 and IL-5, indicating a TH2 type of response. Animals exposed to soluble antigens showed a weaker TH2 response, as evidence by low IgE levels in sera, fewer eosinophils in the blood, and low levels of cytokine production from lung and spleen cells.The results indicate that the physical nature of the antigen may have a major role in determining the type of immune response of the host.",1994,8006306,no
"Comparative stability, sensitivity and specificity studies with different lots of Blastomyces dermatitidis yeast and mycelial lysate antigens.","Comparative studies were performed to assess the stability and lot-to-lot variation of Blastomyces dermatitidis yeast and mycelial phase lysate antigens. Four lots were prepared from each growth phase of B. dermatitidis strain T-58 (canine isolate) during a 14-month period. Serum specimens from dogs with blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis and aspergillosis were assayed for antibody content using an alkaline phosphatase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The four lots of the yeast phase reagents were similar with respect to sensitivity and specificity, and the absorbance readings were approximately four times greater with sera from dogs with blastomycosis than with histoplasmosis or coccidioidomycosis. Even less cross-reactivity was evidenced when the sera from dogs with cryptococcosis and aspergillosis were assayed. In contrast, the four lots of the mycelial lysate reagents were considerably less reactive and more cross-reactive than the yeast phase antigens and, as above, the four reagents retained their activity after prolonged storage. Therefore the results indicated that the lysate antigens exhibited a great deal of stability and lot-to-lot variations in activity were not observed.",1994,7898510,no
[Are amylases in bakery products and flour potential food allergens?].,"The enzyme alpha-amylase from the mould Aspergillus oryzae (Asp o II) routinely used for the production of bread, cakes and pastries has in recent years been identified as an inhalative allergen for occupational diseases (bakers' asthma). It is doubtful whether this amylase in the final product, i.e. after the baking procedure, can still be regarded as an allergen. To clarify this question, detailed case histories on 138 subjects were recorded (98 allergics, 20 patients suffering form chronic intestinal diseases, 20 healthy controls). The clinical examinations included prick skin test and IgE antibody determination using one of the customary enzyme preparations. EAST showed a few of these 138 bread consumers to be weakly sensitized to the enzyme. One of the subjects displayed a significant reaction to alpha-amylase heated to 200 degrees C. As expected, eleven bakers sensitized to alpha-amylase by inhaling it in the workplace (positive prick test, positive case history) predominantly exhibited specific IgE antibodies to the native enzyme. Apart from one weakly positive finding, heated alpha-amylase yielded negative results in this collective. Baking conditions vary widely, especially with regard to single components, temperature and duration. Thus, further investigations as to residual allergenicity or the feasible occurrence of new antigenic determinants during the production of bread, cake and pastries are required. 27% of bakers examined and 9% of atopics showed antibodies to a flour inherent enzyme, a beta-amylase. On the whole, the selected conditions hinted at a weakly sensitizing potential inherent in baking flour and in added amylase.",1994,8209207,no
Aspergillus ribotoxins react with IgE and IgG antibodies of patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"Asp f I has been identified as a major allergen of Aspergillus fumigatus and shows amino acid sequence homology with the mitogillin family of cytotoxins. In this study we compared the various cytotoxins from Aspergillus species for their reactivity with immunoglobulin E (IgE) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in the serum samples of patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Elevated levels of IgE and IgG antibodies to all A. fumigatus antigens and ribotoxins were demonstrated in a majority of ABPA patients as compared with allergic patients with asthma and normal subjects. In approximately 75% of patients with allergic aspergillosis, IgE antibody to ribotoxins showed marked elevation, whereas in the remaining patients it was below the baseline, although crude A. fumigatus antigen showed higher specific serum IgE. These results suggest that cytotoxins play a major role in the pathogenesis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.",1994,8195680,no
Serum anti-Aspergillus fumigatus antibodies by immunoblot and ELISA in cystic fibrosis with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) occurs with a prevalence of 5% to 15% in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Because of the frequent colonization with Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) in CF, the causative agent of ABPA, antibody reactivity to Af proteins is frequently observed, which obscures the diagnosis of ABPA. Patients with CF are also categorized according to the presence of positive skin test responses to Af and/or the presence of positive precipitins. In this study we used ELISA and immunoblot assay to detect IgE and IgG anti-Af antibodies in patients with CF and ABPA (n = 13) compared with other groups of patients with CF: those with positive skin test and positive precipitin results (n = 18), those with positive skin test and negative precipitin results (n = 14), those with negative skin test and positive precipitin results (n = 10), and those with negative skin test and negative precipitin results (n = 35). IgE and IgG anti-Af antibodies were significantly elevated in patients with ABPA as determined by both immunoblot assay (p < 0.01) and ELISA (p < 0.01). However, detection of Af antibodies by ELISA was more sensitive in discriminating patients with CF and ABPA from patients with CF who had positive skin test and positive precipitin results but lacked radiographic and clinical evidence of ABPA. In patients with CF and ABPA the immunoblot assays demonstrated a multitude of IgE, IgG, and IgA antibody responses to Af proteins, which ranged in molecular weight from 14 kd to greater than 106 kd. The level of IgE anti-Af antibody to individual proteins decreased during remissions of ABPA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1994,8182235,no
Isolation and denomination of an important allergen in baking additives: alpha-amylase from Aspergillus oryzae (Asp o II).,"The commercially available alpha-amylase from Aspergillus oryzae which is widely used as a baking additive was compared with a highly purified enzyme preparation. We used enzyme allergosorbent test (EAST), EAST inhibition, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), isoelectric focussing, immunoblotting, and N-terminal amino acid sequencing to characterize the causative allergen. Our screening comprised 89 partially selected bakers. Forty-three (48%) of them had work-related respiratory symptoms 14 (32%) of whom were sensitized to the baking additive. Significant immunological differences could not be found between crude and purified sample with the exception that the latter one produced nearly twice as high antibody values. Iodine starch staining demonstrated that the component which was exclusively or predominantly bound by IgE antibodies of symptomatic bakers represents the active alpha-amylase. According to the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) nomenclature, the term Asp o II is suggested for this important occupational allergen.",1994,8087658,no
Indole-3-carbinol induces a rat liver glutathione transferase subunit (Yc2) with high activity toward aflatoxin B1 exo-epoxide. Association with reduced levels of hepatic aflatoxin-DNA adducts in vivo.,"Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), a metabolite of the grain mold Aspergillus flavus, is a potent hepatocarcinogen and widespread contaminant of human food supplies. AFB1-induced tumors or preneoplastic lesions in experimental animals can be inhibited by cotreatment with several compounds, including indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a component of cruciferous vegetables, and the well-known Ah receptor agonist beta-naphthoflavone (BNF). This study examines the influence of these two agents on the AFB1-glutathione detoxication pathway and AFB1-DNA adduction in rat liver. After 7 days of feeding approximately equally inhibitory doses of I3C (0.2%) or BNF (0.04%) alone or in combination, male Fischer 344 rats were administered [3H]AFB1 (0.5 mg/kg, 480 microCi/kg) intraperitoneally and killed 2 hr later. All three experimental diets inhibited in vivo AFB1-DNA adduction (BNF, 46% I3C, 68%",1994,8070315,no
Indole-3-carbinol and beta-naphthoflavone induction of aflatoxin B1 metabolism and cytochromes P-450 associated with bioactivation and detoxication of aflatoxin B1 in the rat.,"Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a highly hepatotoxic and hepatocarcinogenic secondary metabolite of the grain mold Aspergillus flavus and related fungi. Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), found in cruciferous vegetables, can both inhibit and promote AFB1-induced carcinogenesis. We have examined the influence of dietary treatment with I3C and the well-known Ah receptor agonist beta-naphthoflavone (BNF) on the relative levels of different cytochrome P-450 (CYP) isoforms known to metabolize AFB1 in male Fischer 344 rats. After 7 days of feeding 0.2% I3C or 0.04% BNF, alone or in combination, the relative levels of hepatic CYP1A1, 1A2, 2B1/2, 2C11, and 3A were assessed by laser densitometry of Western blots. Both diets containing I3C markedly increased band densities of CYP1A1 (up to 24-fold), 1A2 (3.1-fold), and 3A1/2 (3.8-fold), and had lesser effects on the levels of 2B1/2 (1.8-fold) and no effect on CYP2C11. BNF also strongly increased band densities of CYP1A1 (12-fold) and 1A2 (2.7-fold), but had no effect on the levels of CYP2B1/2 or 3A1/2 band densities, and repressed those of CYP2C11 (2-fold). In addition, we examined the in vitro hepatic microsomal metabolism of AFB1 at 16, 124, and 512 microM substrate levels. Diets containing I3C elevated initial rates of AFM1 (a detoxication product) production 18.6- to 19.2-fold over control at 16 microM AFB1, which declined to 7.8- to 9.5-fold at 512 microM AFB1. The BNF-only diet gave similar, but less dramatic effects (5.9-fold at 16 microM AFB1, 3.5-fold at 512 microM AFB1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1994,8070314,no
Interleukin-8 in alcoholic liver disease.,"Acute alcoholic hepatitis is accompanied by features of the acute phase response, peripheral blood neutrophilia and liver neutrophil infiltrate even in the absence of demonstrable bacterial or fungal infection. Plasma levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), the major cytokine inducers of the acute phase response, are markedly raised in acute alcoholic hepatitis and correlate closely with clinical and laboratory indicators of disease severity. The potent neutrophil activator and chemotaxin interleukin-8 (IL-8) is released in response to TNF and recent interest has focussed on its possible role in producing the characteristic peripheral blood neutrophilia and liver neutrophil infiltrate in alcoholic hepatitis. Circulating IL-8 and liver tissue levels of IL-8 are markedly raised in alcoholic hepatitis, with highest levels in patients who die within the first four weeks of admission to hospital. There is a close correlation between hepatic IL-8 and infiltration with neutrophils. Less dramatic increases in circulating IL-8 are present in abstinent alcoholic cirrhotics and patients admitted for detoxification. These observations suggest a central role for IL-8 in the neutrophilia and hepatic neutrophil infiltrate characteristic of acute alcoholic hepatitis.",1994,7810274,no
Immunologic significance of a collagen-derived culture filtrate containing proteolytic activity in Aspergillus-related diseases.,"Despite increasing evidence implicating fungal proteases in the virulence of pulmonary fungal diseases, routine fungal culture media do not favor protease production. Hence, filtrates that serve as the source of antigen for serologic determinations are poor in proteases, and consequently, the immunologic significance of these enzymes is unknown.A clinical isolate of Aspergillus fumigatus was cultured on collagen medium, resulting in excretion of high levels of fungal proteases in the culture filtrate. This was compared with standard culture filtrates by diverse analytic techniques including immunoblotting with sera of patients with pulmonary aspergilloma (PA) and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA).Protein profiles of collagen medium filtrate showed several (glyco)proteins not found in conventional culture filtrates, including a prominent 32 kd glycoprotein, which coisolated in gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography with elastase activity, as well as 67 kd and 94 kd (glyco)proteins. Intense IgG binding was seen with the 32 kd glycoprotein when ABPA and PA sera were used. The 94 kd protein showed intense binding with PA sera but not with ABPA sera, whereas for the 67 kd glycoprotein the reverse tended to be the case.Fungal culture on collagen media results in the production of filtrates with high protease activity, containing unique (glyco)proteins of which at least one (32 kd) is closely associated with fungal elastase activity. These constituents are immunologically relevant, eliciting IgG production in patients with PA and ABPA, suggesting production of these (glyco)proteins during disease in vivo. The use of collagen media filtrates may enhance our serodiagnostic capacity in patients with fungal pulmonary diseases.",1994,8163786,no
Allergens in Aspergillus fumigatus. I. Characterization of two different allergen extracts and evaluation of their stability and the importance of carbohydrate for IgE binding.,"Aspergillus fumigatus grown in submerged and surface cultures was extracted, and the extracts were analyzed separately. The submerged extract contained 31.9% protein and 8.3% carbohydrate, while the corresponding values were 17.0% and 33.3% for the surface material. With individual sera from patients with allergic asthma, SDS-PAGE combined with immunoblotting revealed that the submerged extract contained at least six strong IgE-binding components (20, 30, 38, 50, 68, and 90 kDa) in addition to several weak to medium IgE-binding components. The surface extract contained about the same number of IgE-binding components, but only one gave a strong reaction (20 kDa). The allergens present were shown to have pI between 4.5 and 5.6 as demonstrated by isoelectric focusing (IEF) combined with immunoblotting. For identification of A. fumigatus glycoprotein allergens, both extracts were treated with periodate under mild conditions. Two allergens of the submerged extract (90 and 38 kDa) partly lost their IgE-binding ability by this treatment, indicating that these components are glycoproteins and that the carbohydrate moiety is involved in the IgE binding. The IgE-binding ability of the 20-kDa allergen was not influenced by periodate. For assessment of the stability of the two allergen extracts, aqueous solutions were kept at 4 degrees C for 2, 7, and 21 d and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The results showed that most allergens of the submerged extract were partly inactivated after 2 d. After 21 d, only the 20-kDa and 30-kDa components were still able to bind IgE. Similar results were obtained by analyzing the surface extract.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1994,8037357,no
Novel structures of N-linked high-mannose type oligosaccharides containing alpha-D-galactofuranosyl linkages in Aspergillus niger alpha-D-glucosidase.,"Seven oligosaccharides were isolated from alpha-D-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20) from Aspergillus niger, and the structures of these oligosaccharides were studied by 1H NMR spectroscopy. After treatment of the alpha-D-glucosidase with N-glycosidase F, seven major oligosaccharide peaks were detected by Dionex anion-exchange HPLC. The structures corresponding to the three peaks OS-1, OS-2, and OS-4 were determined to be Man8GlcNAc2, Man9GlcNAc2, and GlcMan9GlcNAc2, respectively, from 1H NMR spectra of the isolated fractions. Each of the four oligosaccharides OS-5, OS-6, OS-7-1, and OS-7-2 contained an alpha-D-galactofuranosyl residue (Galf) linked to Man(A) via an alpha-(1-->2)-linkage. OS-7 was found to consist of two oligosaccharides. The structures of these four oligosaccharides were determined to be GalfMan5GlcNAc2, GalfMan6GlcNAc2, GalfMan7GlcNAc2, and GalfMan8GlcNAc2 by 1H NMR spectroscopy and compositional analysis. The Galf structure of GalfMan5GlcNAc2 was found to be identical to that of an oligosaccharide previously isolated from the alpha-D-galactosidase of the same strain. The structure of OS-3 remains undetermined.",1994,8194071,no
Aspergillus flavus and other mycoflora of groundnut kernels in Israel and the absence of aflatoxin.,"More than 300 groundnut (peanut) samples collected from different regions of Israel were examined by ELISA for aflatoxin contamination. Samples were designated for export, local consumption or for sowing. None of the samples were contaminated with the toxin. However, when kernels were kept at high humidity (RH≊99%), aflatoxin could be frequently detected seven days after incubation and the toxin was not uniformly distributed among kernels.Aspergillus niger, A flavus, Penicillium citrinum andP pinophilum were the dominant fungi and no differences were observed among cultivars. Almost half of the commercial samples examined were devoid ofA flavus. Other fungi identified wereA tamaril, A amstelodami, P rubrum, Rhizoctonia solani, Macrophomina phaseolina, Rhizopus spp., Sclerotium rolfsll, Fusarium andAlternaria spp the two last ones comprising a group of low incidence.Although groundnut samples that containA flavus-infected kernels are moderately common, the local climate and agrotechniques In use in Israel are not conducive to aflatoxin accumulation.

Evaluation of enzyme immunoassay for Candida cytoplasmic antigens in neutropenic cancer patients.,"A Candida albicans cytoplasmic antigen enzyme immunoassay (CACP antigen EIA) was developed with antibodies raised against antigens prepared from yeast cells grown under standardized growth conditions. The C. albicans components reactive in the EIA were shown to be predominantly proteins with associated carbohydrates. Denaturing gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of five major CACP proteins with molecular weights between 36,000 and 44,000. The clinical usefulness of the CACP EIA was evaluated by retrospective blinded measurement of 89 serum samples from 31 granulocytopenic patient episodes. Twice-weekly surveillance cultures, sequential serum samples (approximately once per week or with change of the clinical course), and standard diagnostic criteria of fungal infection were used to categorize patients. The sensitivity and specificity of the CACP assay on the basis of serum samples were 82 and 100%, respectively (67 and 100% on the basis of patient episodes). The positive and negative predictive values were 100 and 97% for serum (100 and 93% for patient episodes). By comparison, the CANDTEC assay had low sensitivity (33%) and poor positive predictive values (50%). The CACP EIA may be a useful test suitable for further evaluations as a method for the diagnosis of invasive Candida infection in neutropenic cancer patients.",1994,8195392,no
Otic administration of amphotericin B 0.25% in sterile water.,"To report otic administration of parenteral amphotericin B 0.25% in sterile water.A 44-year-old HIV+ man was diagnosed with otitis externa. The patient's past medical history was remarkable for positive Coccidioides immitis serology for more than five months, essential hypertension, and Barrett's esophagitis. Culture results from an ear swab revealed 4+ Aspergillus fumigatus and 3+ Staphylococcus, coagulase negative. Antiinfective therapy for the otitis externa included oral and topical antibacterial and antifungal medications. Amphotericin B 0.25% in sterile water was prepared by the pharmacy for topical otic administration. The otic amphotericin B was dispensed with instructions to refrigerate and assigned a one-week expiration date. The prescription called for instillation of 1-2 drops in each ear three times a day. The patient's signs and symptoms of otitis externa resolved during several weeks of antiinfective therapy. Topical administration of amphotericin B 0.25% in sterile water was not associated with any local adverse effects in this patient.The rationale for use of the parenteral amphotericin B formulation to prepare an otic dosage form, and the rationale for the specific concentration and expiration date chosen are discussed.This patient tolerated topical otic administration of amphotericin B 0.25% in sterile water when administered three times daily.",1994,8193421,no
"Recombinant expression and antigenic properties of a 32-kilodalton extracellular alkaline protease, representing a possible virulence factor from Aspergillus fumigatus.","A 32-kDa nonglycosylated alkaline protease (EC 3.4.1.14) with elastolytic activity, secreted by the opportunistic pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC 42202, is suggested to be a virulence factor of this fungus. The enzyme is a serine protease of the subtilisin family, and its cDNA nucleotide sequence has recently been reported. We have cloned the cDNA encoding the mature protease into a high-level Escherichia coli expression plasmid and produced the recombinant protease as a fusion protein with a six-adjacent-histidine affinity tag at the carboxy terminus. Subsequently, the recombinant protease was purified to homogeneity, with affinity chromatography yielding 30 to 40 mg of recombinant protease per liter of E. coli culture. Refolded recombinant protease, in comparison with native protease, demonstrated weak enzymatic activity but similar immunochemical characteristics as analyzed by antigen-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), competition ELISA, and immunoblotting assays. To assess the allergenic potential of the protease, sera from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and sera from healthy control individuals were analyzed by ELISA and immunoblotting techniques. Sera from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis did not have protease-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies and, remarkably, did not show significantly elevated protease-specific IgG antibody levels compared with those in sera from healthy control individuals. This suggests that the alkaline protease from A. fumigatus does not elicit IgE antibodies and has weak immunogenicity, a property which may explain fungus persistence in allergic individuals.",1994,8112866,no
Allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis caused by the basidiomycetous fungus Schizophyllum commune.,"We describe, to our knowledge, the first case of allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPM) caused by the basidiomycetous fungus Schizophyllum commune in an otherwise healthy woman. Bronchoscopic analysis repeatedly disclosed S. commune hyphae in the bronchi of the lingular lobe these hyphae were originally misidentified as Aspergillus because the presence of clamp connections was overlooked. A lingular infiltrate with ectatic proximal bronchi, eosinophilia, an elevated serum level of IgE, and antibodies to S. commune supported the diagnosis. It is sometimes difficult to isolate and identify S. commune in clinical specimens, and hence only a limited number of cases of ABPM might have been correctly diagnosed in the past. We suspect, therefore, that some cases of ABPM caused by an allergic reaction to S. commune may be misdiagnosed as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis or eosinophilic pneumonia of unknown origin. The significance of S. commune in allergic bronchopulmonary diseases is discussed.",1994,8011808,no
Experimental aspergillosis in guinea pigs: influence of itraconazole on fungaemia and invasive fungal growth.,"The guinea pig model of experimental aspergillosis was used to evaluate the efficacy of itraconazole 2.5 and 5 mg kg-1 in preventing the invasive phase of the disease when animals were already loaded with Aspergillus conidia. Evaluations were made by recording the survival rates, culturing fragments of nine organs, examining seven organs by means of histochemistry and immunohistochemistry (mAb EB-A1 to Aspergillus galactomannan) and by serological titration of galactomannan. The data indicate that itraconazole is highly effective in preventing true invasive aspergillosis. Serological evaluations of antigenaemia suggest that low titres may only reflect fungaemia, while titres of 1:8 and above are suggestive of invasive disease.",1994,7845416,no
Diagnosis of paracoccidioidomycosis by dot immunobinding assay for antibody detection using the purified and specific antigen gp43.,"The dot immunobinding assay, a rapid, visually read test, was adapted for serodiagnosis and follow-up of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM). Purified gp43 antigen was tested before and after sodium metaperiodate treatment. To evaluate the assay, it was tested with sera from PCM, histoplasmosis, Jorge Lobo's disease, aspergillosis, candidiasis, and cryptococcosis patients and healthy subjects. Native gp43 gave positive results with all sera from PCM patients and weakly positive results with sera from Jorge Lobo's disease patients (31.3%). No false-positive results were obtained when periodate-treated gp43 was used as the antigen. These results indicate that the dot immunobinding test is sensitive, specific, economical, and fast for serodiagnosis and follow-up studies of PCM.",1994,8150974,no
Efficacy of unilamellar liposomal amphotericin B in treatment of pulmonary aspergillosis in persistently granulocytopenic rabbits: the potential role of bronchoalveolar D-mannitol and serum galactomannan as markers of infection.,"A model of primary pulmonary aspergillosis in rabbits was developed to reproduce the persistent levels of profound granulocytopenia and the histopathologic features of bronchopneumonia, vascular invasion, and hemorrhagic infarction encountered in humans. D-mannitol was detectable in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy, and galactomannan was measurable in serum by latex agglutination immunoassay. A pharmacokinetically distinctive unilamellar vesicle formulation of liposomal amphotericin B, 5 mg/kg/day intravenously, compared with high-dose conventional desoxycholate amphotericin B, 1 mg/kg/day intravenously, was more effective in preventing nephrotoxicity, increasing survival, reducing the number of viable organisms, and decreasing tissue injury due to Aspergillus organisms. Thus, D-mannitol in lavage fluid and galactomannan in serum may be useful markers of pulmonary aspergillosis, and liposomal amphotericin B was significantly more effective and safer than desoxycholate amphotericin B for treatment of pulmonary aspergillosis in profoundly granulocytopenic rabbits.",1994,8106769,no
Isolation and structure of novel defensive peptides from frog skin.,"In addition to the highly specific cell-mediated immune system, vertebrates possess an efficient host-defense mechanism against invading microorganisms which involves the synthesis of highly potent antimicrobial peptides with a large spectrum of activity. A 34-residue cationic and amphiphatic peptide, designated dermaseptin I, was recently isolated from the skin of the arboreal frog Phyllomedusa sauvagii and was shown to exhibit microbicidal activity against various pathogenic microorganisms including bacteria, yeast, protozoa and filamentous fungi. In this study, we report the isolation and characterization of four novel antimicrobial peptides from frog skin through the combined use of an anti-dermaseptin enzyme immunoassay and an antifungal bioassay. The 28-34-residue antimicrobial peptides are cationic, containing 3-5 lysine residues that punctuate an alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic sequence. Based on their primary structure, all four peptides can be fitted to a class L amphipathic alpha helix which places all lysine residues on the polar side of the helix. The four antimicrobial peptides have high sequence similarity with dermaseptin I (53-94% similarity) suggesting that their respective genes are all members of the same family. In addition, pairwise sequence alignment of dermaseptin I and adenoregulin, a 33-residue cationic peptide recently isolated from frog skin and shown to enhance the binding of agonists to the A1 adenosine receptor, reveals 62% similarity (39% amino acid positional identity). Both peptides share a similar but non-identical spectrum of antimicrobial activity, being active against bacteria, yeast and filamentous molds. However, no significant hemolytic activity was found for these peptides which suggests a selectivity for prokaryotic cells. These findings indicate that adenoregulin should be included in the dermaseptin family of peptides. In addition, tryptic digestion of purified pro-dermaseptin I liberated a 15-amino-acid peptide identified as the authentic C-terminus of dermaseptin I. These results are in accordance with the predicted sequences of pro-dermaseptins obtained through molecular cloning, in which the dermaseptin progenitor sequences are located at the extreme C-terminus of the precursors.",1994,8306981,no
Hyperimmune serum modulates allergic response to spores in a murine model of allergic aspergillosis.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a disease in atopic asthmatics characterized by eosinophilia and elevated levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE) and IgG antibodies to the ubiquitous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus (Af). The role of specific antibodies in the disease process is not clear. In this study, BALB/c mice were injected with hyperimmune serum from syngeneic mice exposed to soluble antigen of Af. These mice were then exposed to either Af spores or soluble antigen. Total IgE, Af-specific IgG1 (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) in serum, and eosinophils (eosinophil peroxidase assay) in lungs and bone marrow were measured. Histologic sections of lungs were examined for cellular infiltration and morphologic changes. Results indicate a suppression of increase in levels of antibodies and eosinophilia in mice receiving immune serum and exposed to spores compared with controls receiving phosphate-buffered saline treatment. Spores being the primary source of exposure to Af in ABPA, these results are significant in understanding the role of preexisting specific antibodies in patients.",1994,8283139,no
Analysis of the regulation of penicillin biosynthesis in Aspergillus nidulans by targeted disruption of the acvA gene.,"To analyse the regulation of the biosynthesis of the secondary metabolite penicillin in Aspergillus nidulans, a strain with an inactivated acvA gene produced by targeted disruption was used. acvA encodes delta-(L-alpha-aminoadipyl)-L-cysteinyl-D-valine synthetase (ACVS), which catalyses the first step in the penicillin biosynthetic pathway. To study the effect of the inactivated acvA gene on the expression of acvA and the second gene, ipnA, which encodes isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS), A. nidulans strain XEPD, with the acvA disruption, was crossed with strain AXB4A carrying acvA-uidA and ipnA-lacZ fusion genes. Ascospores with the predicted non-penicillin producing phenotype and a hybridization pattern indicating the presence of the disrupted acvA gene, and the fusion genes integrated in single copy at the chromosomal argB locus were identified. Both fusion genes were expressed at the same level as in the non-disrupted strain. Western blot analysis (immunoblotting) revealed that similar amounts of IPNS enzyme were present in both strains from 24 to 68 h of a fermentation run. In the acvA disrupted strain, IPNS and acyl-CoA: 6-aminopenicillanic acid acyltransferase (ACT) specific activities were detected, excluding a sequential induction mechanism of regulation of the penicillin biosynthesis gene ipnA and the third gene aat.",1994,8277946,no
Cholestatic hepatitis leading to hepatic failure in a patient with organ-transmitted hepatitis C virus infection.,"A 51-year-old heart transplant recipient who developed subfulminant hepatic failure because of organ-transmitted hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is described. He presented with a predominantly cholestatic liver damage after heart transplantation. An extensive evaluation, including abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography scan and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was unrevealing. Liver biopsy, however, was suggestive of a large duct obstruction with prominent portal and pericellular fibrosis, marked cholestasis, pericholangitis with marked ductular proliferation, and diffuse hepatocyte degeneration. Antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) was initially negative. He deteriorated in the ensuing 3 months. A repeat enzyme immunoassay-2 test for anti-HCV 4 months after initial presentation was weakly positive. Quantitation of serum HCV RNA by branched DNA assay revealed high level viremia, 547 x 10(6) genome equivalents per milliliter. Using in situ polymerase chain reaction, HCV RNA was detected in the cytoplasm in > 80% of the hepatocytes. The patient underwent interferon alfa therapy, and serum HCV RNA levels were reduced 20-fold after four doses. Unfortunately, the patient developed pulmonary aspergillosis and died. This case illustrates that in immunosuppressed patients anti-HCV is not a good marker for the diagnosis of HCV infection, and HCV can cause a progressive form of cholestatic liver disease mimicking a large duct obstruction.",1994,8276189,no
A case of Aspergillus fumigatus peritonitis complicating liver transplantation.,"A 55-year-old male underwent orthotopic liver transplantation for sub-fulminant hepatitis B/delta infection superimposed on probable genetic hemochromatosis with early cirrhosis. Pre-operatively, he demonstrated serologic evidence of cytomegalovirus reactivation and developed cytomegalovirus viremia when ganciclovir was discontinued post-operatively. His post-operative course was complicated by chronic ductopenic rejection, biliary anastomotic leak, and persistent confusion and malaise. At the time of laparotomy for repair of the bile leak, nodular peritoneal lesions were noted, with biopsy and culture showing angioinvasive Aspergillus fumigatus. Despite administration of amphotericin B, the patient continued to have culture-confirmed evidence of infection at follow-up peritoneoscopy. Oral itraconazole was begun, but the patient died of liver failure secondary to progressive ductolpenic rejection. At autopsy, Aspergillus organisms were seen in histologic sections taken from the small bowel there was no evidence of disseminated disease.",1994,8168555,no
[Evaluation of (1-3)-beta-D-glucan in aspergillosis and cryptococcosis].,"(1-3)-beta-D-Glucan (beta-glucan) is a major structural component of fungi. The G test is a direct method to detect beta-glucan using fractionated (1-3)-beta-D-glucan-sensitive component, factor G, eluted from the limulus lysate. Previously, we reported that the G test is a more sensitive method than the mannan detection assay for the serological diagnosis of Candida infection. In this study, we discuss beta-glucanemia in patients with pulmonary aspergillosis and cryptococcosis. The concentration of beta-glucan was less than 10 pg/ml in 9 of 10 cases of pulmonary cryptococcosis, except for one case receiving hemodialysis (16.5 pg/ml). beta-Glucan increased in 3 cases of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (27-937 pg/ml). Galactomannan antigen was positive in all of those cases. In 8 cases of aspergilloma, which showed fungus ball on roentgenogram, the mean concentration of beta-glucan was 67.1 +/- 92.7 pg/ml. Two of 8 cases were positive for galactomannan antigen. One of three cases of PAIC (productive aspergilloma on the inner wall of a cavity) and one case of chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis showed slightly increased levels of beta-glucan and positive results of galactomannan antigen test.",1994,8114372,no
[Occupational asthma caused by organic substances].,"Occupational asthma (OA) to organic substances is frequently related to IgE-dependent hypersensitivity. New etiological agents are latex and vegetal gums, in health care personnel as in carpet-making manufactures. Bakers are exposed to numerous allergens: wheat and cereal flours, sesame and other seed proteins, alpha-amylase and other enzymes. Alpha-amylase extracted from Aspergillus orizae is a potent allergen. Plant derived materials have been identified as allergens in the floral industry (Ficus, Ginseng, Gypsophila, etc). The accurate diagnosis relies upon a thorough history, completed by measurements of peak expiratory flows during the work. Sensitization can be confirmed by prick tests and immuno assays for IgE antibodies. Bronchial provocation tests documenting OA are advisable. The early detection of OA might be evaluated by skin tests to occupational allergens repeated yearly. The prevention of OA relies on air sampling technologies controlling the allergenic density of the atmosphere and removing asthmatics from exposed areas. There are no scientific grounds for discarding atopics from occupations at risk for OA.",1994,8079074,no
Western blot detection of IgG anti-Aspergillus fumigatus elastase in sera of patients with aspergillosis.,Anti-Aspergillus fumigatus alkaline protease IgG was investigated by Western blot. Specific IgG antibodies were detected in sera of two of nine patients with proven or highly probable invasive aspergillosis and in sera of one of eight patients with proven or highly probable allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. No response was obtained in sera of 23 control patients. The specific but transient IgG response to this induced enzyme does not recommend its use as sole serodiagnostic aid.,1994,7965494,no
[Long-term treatment of patients with itraconazole for the prevention of Aspergillus infections in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD)].,"Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) represents an innate immunodeficiency: the reduced production of oxygen radicals in phagocytosing cells results in decreased ability to kill pathogenic microorganisms. The patients concerned suffer from severe recurrent infections due to bacteria and fungi. Prophylactic administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, as usual in CGD-patients, has markedly reduced the incidence of bacterial infections. Now as before, however, there is a high risk to become affected by invasive fungal infections, mainly due to Aspergillus spp. which often are lethal. Therefore, a well-compatible antimycotic long-term prophylaxis effective against Aspergillus would be attractive. In the present study the compatibility of the oral triazole itraconazole was tested in 8 CGD-patients with high risk of Aspergillus infections. Itraconazole was administered in capsules with a dosage of 5.1 mg/kg body weight per day on an average for a mean range of 23 months. Periodically liver enzymes, renal retention and electrolytes were assessed as well as itraconazole serum levels. Aspergillus serology tests included complement fixation tests, IgG-ELISA, precipitation tests, IgE determination and Aspergillus-RAST. During the prophylactic treatment in all of the 8 patients no gastrointestinal side effects or hypersensitivity reactions were observed. Renal retention and serum electrolytes as well as liver enzyme values were in normal ranges with all patients. Itraconazole serum levels showed a marked intra- and interindividual variability. However, 82% of the peak levels were in ranges regarded as therapeutically effective for itraconazole. Under prophylaxis a clear decrease of Aspergillus IgG-ELISA values was observed in 5 of 7 patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1994,7609746,no
Fungal polysaccharides.,"Fungal polysaccharides are cell wall components which may act as antigens or as structural substrates. As antigens, the role of mannans in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, and of glycoproteins in Aspergillus fumigatus are discussed. Analyses on beta-glucan synthetase in Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and the inhibitory effect of Hansenula mrakii killer toxin on beta-glucan biosynthesis are also considered.",1994,7536840,no
Diagnostic value of recombinant Aspergillus fumigatus allergen I/a for skin testing and serology.,"We report a clinical study comparing the recombinant Aspergillus fumigatus allergen I/a (rAsp f I/a) to two commercial A. fumigatus extracts in skin prick tests, intradermal tests, and serologic assays.Patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and A. fumigatus-allergic patients with asthma, and control subjects, including allergic patients with asthma without allergy to A. fumigatus and healthy subjects, were investigated.All patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (n = 15) reacted to skin prick tests with the commercial extracts, and eight were sensitized to rAsp f I/a. Of 10 patients with well-characterized A. fumigatus-allergic asthma nine showed positive skin prick test results to at least one of the commercial extracts, and five reacted to rAsp f I/a. There was a strong correlation between skin test reactivity to rAsp f I/a and rAsp f I/a-specific serum IgE as determined by an antigen-specific ELISA. The healthy control subjects (n = 7) and allergic patients with asthma without A. fumigatus allergy (n = 6) did not react in skin prick and intradermal tests to rAsp f I/a, nor did they have detectable amounts of rAsp f I/a-specific IgE. In addition, patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis showed significant elevated levels of rAsp f I/a-specific IgG4 and IgG1 but no significant differences in rAsp f I/a-specific serum IgA levels when compared with the healthy control subjects.The data show that rAsp f I/a is a major allergen with biologic relevance in some A. fumigatus-allergic individuals as evaluated by skin prick tests, intradermal tests, or serologic methods. Furthermore, no discrepancies were observed between skin test results and rAsp f I/a-specific IgE. Hence the correlation between rAsp f I/a skin test results and serologic data indicates the potential of recombinant allergens for clinical applications and diagnosis of allergies.",1994,7508461,no
Monoclonal antibodies against a 97-kilodalton antigen from Aspergillus flavus.,"We prepared a panel of five monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against Aspergillus flavus that all reacted against one 97-kDa antigen by western blot (immunoblot). Flow cytometry demonstrated that these antibodies bound (in increasing degrees) to all morphologic stages of A. flavus growth: conidia, swollen conidia, and hyphae. Cross-reactivity among species was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of fungal culture filtrates. Four MAbs reacted with 10 of 11 A. flavus isolates, and the fifth one reacted with 9 of them. One MAb also reacted with A. fumigatus, two reacted with A. niger, A. wentii, and A. nidulans, and all five reacted with A. ochraceus. None reacted with A. terreus, A. glaucus, A. versicolor, or a Penicillium species. Each MAb bound to A. flavus hyphae in formalin-fixed paraffin sections of a muscle biopsy from a confirmed human case of invasive aspergillosis. In summary, these MAbs identified a 97-kDa antigen found on A. flavus that is both surface bound and an exoantigen. Either the same or a cross-reacting antigen is present in A. fumigatus and other Aspergillus species.",1994,7496924,no
Phosphotransferase system of Streptococcus salivarius: characterization of the ptsH gene and its product.,"The Streptococcus salivarius ptsH gene encoding histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein (HPr) of the phosphotransferase system (PTS) has been cloned, sequenced, and found to be part of a ptsH, ptsI operon. Upstream from ptsH, putative -35 and -10 boxes and a Shine-Dalgarno sequence highly similar to the Escherichia coli consensus regulatory elements were identified. A second promoter, located in the ptsH coding sequence was also observed and is sufficient for the expression of the S. salivarius ptsI gene, encoding enzyme I of the PTS in E. coli [Gagnon et al., Gene 121 (1992) 71-78]. The amino acid sequence of S. salivarius HPr, inferred from the ptsH sequence, shared identity varying between 37 and 76% with known HPr from other bacteria. Moreover, the S. salivarius HPr shared 78% identity with an HPr-like protein of Aspergillus fumigatus, a eukaroytic mold that does not possess a functional PTS. Expression analysis of S. salivarius HPr in E. coli demonstrated that (i) S. salivarius ptsH is expressed in E. coli under the control of its own promoter, (ii) S. salivarius HPr synthesized by E. coli is completely processed by methionine aminopeptidase, and (iii) S. salivarius HPr is phosphorylated in vivo by E. coli enzyme I. It was also observed that, in E. coli, the copy number of pUC18 bearing S. salivarius ptsH was reduced more than 25-fold, as compared to pUC18 without an insertion.",1993,8294015,no
Experimental toxoplasmosis in turkeys.,"Fourteen 2-3-wk-old turkeys were inoculated orally with 10(5) or 10(4) infective oocysts of the ME 49 strain of Toxoplasma gondii. Of the 8 turkeys given 10(5) oocysts in experiment 1, 3 died or were killed 12 or 14 days after inoculation (DAI) because of respiratory distress associated with a concomitant Aspergillus-like fungus infection. The remaining 5 turkeys remained normal and were killed 62 DAI. Toxoplasma gondii was isolated in mice from the heart of all 5, from the breast muscles of 2, leg muscles of 3, and from the brains and livers of none of the turkeys. All 6 turkeys fed 10(4) oocysts in experiment 2 remained clinically normal until necropsy on 41 DAI T. gondii was isolated from pooled tissues from each turkey. All 14 turkeys developed high antibody titers to T. gondii in the modified agglutination test (MAT) using formalinized tachyzoites. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was as sensitive as MAT for detecting T. gondii antibodies in turkey sera. The latex agglutination and indirect hemagglutination tests were less sensitive than the MAT and ELISA. No dye-test-measurable antibodies were found in sera of any turkey.",1993,8277389,no
Humoral immunoresponse of pigeons to Aspergillus fumigatus antigens.,"The aim of this study was to develop an immunological model of avian Aspergillosis by studying the humoral response of pigeons to Aspergillus fumigatus antigens. Immunization was performed by administering weekly injections of A. fumigatus extracts for 70 days (10 weeks). A new booster injection was given 270 days (9 months) following the last immunization. Results showed an early Aspergillus-specific humoral immunoresponse which reached a maximum level at 42-63 days (6-9 weeks) post-immunization. Using the ELISA method, it could be observed that A. fumigatus-specific IgG became elevated in the 2nd week and reached a maximum titre at 63rd day (9th week). In contrast, A. fumigatus-specific IgM levels appeared early showing maximum levels at the 2nd week, after which they declined despite the maintenance of antigenic stimulation. Termination of immunization resulted in the decrease of specific humoral immunoresponse with minimal levels of specific antibodies detectable 210 days (7 months) later. A booster injection given at 270 days (9 months) induced a very fast Aspergillus-specific IgM and IgG immunoresponse, reaching levels of antibodies similar to those observed during the immunization period.",1993,8022463,no
"Cytomegalovirus immune globulin prophylaxis in liver transplantation. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.","To study the effect of cytomegalovirus immune globulin (CMVIG) on prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease and its complications in patients receiving liver transplants.Randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial.Four university-affiliated transplant centers in Boston (Boston Center for Liver Transplantation).One hundred forty-one liver transplant recipients completed the study.CMVIG or placebo (1% albumin) given in a dose of 150 mg/kg body weight within 72 hours of the transplant, then at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8, and at 100 mg/kg at weeks 12 and 16.Patients were observed for 1 year after transplantation for the development of CMV infection, disease, pneumonia, as well as for opportunistic fungal infections, graft survival, and mortality. Weekly cultures were taken of urine, buffy coat, and throat wash for CMV for 2 months, then monthly, and at any clinical illness.Using a Cox proportional hazards model, CMVIG was shown to reduce severe CMV-associated disease (multi-organ CMV disease, CMV pneumonia, or invasive fungal disease associated with CMV infection) from 26% to 12% (relative risk, 0.39 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.89). When we controlled for the use of monoclonal antibodies to T cells (OKT3), CMVIG use was still protective (relative risk, 0.39CMVIG reduced the rate of severe CMV-associated disease in patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation. No effect of CMVIG on CMV donor-positive, recipient-negative liver transplant recipients was shown, suggesting a need for additional prophylactic strategies.",1993,8214995,no
An 88-kilodalton antigen secreted by Aspergillus fumigatus.,"An 88-kDa component secreted in vitro by Aspergillus fumigatus has been purified by sequential chromatographic procedures. The molecule is a glycoprotein with an N-linked sugar moiety composed of mannose glucose, and galactose (16:10:1). It is recognized by antibodies from patients with aspergilloma and has potential for the immunodiagnosis of aspergilloma. The antigenicity is associated with the polypeptide part of the molecule (79 kDa).",1993,8406876,no
Efficacy of itraconazole solution in a rabbit model of invasive aspergillosis.,"The efficacy of an itraconazole-cyclodextrin solution against Aspergillus fumigatus was assessed in an immunosuppressed, temporarily leukopenic rabbit model of invasive aspergillosis and compared with that of amphotericin B. Oral itraconazole solution at dosages of 20 and 40 mg/kg/day improved survival as compared with that of controls. Itraconazole (40 mg/kg/day) not only improved survival and reduced antigen levels but also significantly eradicated A. fumigatus from tissues and was as effective as amphotericin B in these studies. The higher dose of itraconazole produced higher levels in serum, which correlated with improved efficacy of the drug. This itraconazole-cyclodextrin solution was well absorbed and was effective in the treatment of experimental invasive aspergillosis it demonstrates the potential of this class of agents in improving therapy for invasive aspergillosis.",1993,8285610,no
Purification and characterization of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus nidulans.,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD D-glucose 6-phosphate:NADP+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.49) has been purified from Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus niger by a combination of affinity and anion exchange chromatography. A 500-1000-fold purification was obtained and the final enzyme preparations were shown to be pure but not homogeneous. For both fungi the purified enzyme preparation gave two bands on native and denaturing gels. The catalytically active form is a multimer. The molecular mass of the monomers is 60 and 57 kDa for A. nidulans and 55 and 53 kDa for A. niger. Both enzymes exhibited strict specificity towards both substrates glucose 6-phosphate and NADP+. The A. nidulans and A. niger G6PD enzymes catalyse the conversion of glucose 6-phosphate via a random order mechanism. Inhibition studies provided evidence for the physiological role of G6PD as producer of NADPH in both fungi.",1993,8277259,no
Characterization of an aspartic proteinase of Mucor pusillus expressed in Aspergillus oryzae.,"The aspartic proteinase (MPP) gene from the zygomycete fungus Mucor pusillus was introduced into an ascomycete fungus, Aspergillus oryzae, by protoplast transformation using the nitrate reductase (niaD) gene as the selective marker. Southern blot analysis indicated that the MPP gene was integrated into the resident niaD locus at a copy number of 1-2. MPP secreted by the recombinant A. oryzae was correctly processed but was more highly glycosylated than that produced in the original M. pusillus strain. Treatment with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H and analysis of the carbohydrate composition of the secreted MPP revealed that the extra glycosylation of the MPP secreted by the recombinant A. oryzae was due to altered processing of mannose residues. The extra glycosylation of MPP affected its enzyme properties including its milk-clotting and proteolytic activities.",1993,8246885,no
Identification of the 33-kDa alkaline protease of Aspergillus fumigatus in vitro and in vivo.,"Aspergillus fumigatus produced a 33-kDa serine protease (ALP) in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, this alkaline protease was secreted when the fungus was cultivated in the absence of protein, if the pH of the medium remained close to neutrality. Western blotting and immunoelectronmicroscopy studies showed that ALP was localised in the wall of the fungus and was degraded after secretion in the culture medium under conditions of low pH. Although present in the lung during infection, ALP did not appear to be diagnostically useful and was different from the precipitating chymotrypsin antigen used in the diagnosis of aspergilloma.",1993,8246256,no
Isolation and characterization of a major allergenic component (gp55) of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"IgE class antibodies specific for antigens in a water-soluble extract of Aspergillus fumigatus (strain NHL-5759) were analyzed by immunoblotting with sera from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. All the sera tested were reactive with a major 50 to 60 kd protein in the extract. This allergen, designated gp55, was purified by gel filtration and preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The antigen was found to be present in the water-soluble extract in the form of a complex composed of approximately eight molecules of gp55. The carbohydrate and phosphate content of the purified antigen were 23.1% and 0.46%, respectively. The molar ratio of mannose to galactose residues was 2.76:1, and the protein was glycosylated predominantly with N-linked oligosaccharides. The serologic activity of the gp55 antigen was abolished by treatment with nonspecific protease (Pronase) but not by treatment with sodium metaperiodate or endoglycosidases. Thus the major antigenic site of the glycoprotein is located within its peptide moiety. The antigen itself displayed no chymotryptic or tryptic activity. The amino acid sequence of the 20 N-terminal residues of the antigen (ATPHEPVFFSWDAGAVTSFP) is different from that of any other protein previously reported.",1993,8227861,no
A study of the alkaline proteases secreted by different Aspergillus species.,"Strains from several species of Aspergillus were grown in the presence of soluble collagen, and the major secreted proteins present in the culture fluid were examined for proteolytic activity. The possibility of relatedness among the alkaline proteases secreted by Aspergillus was studied by probing extracts from the various species with polyclonal antisera raised to the isolated alkaline proteases of A. fumigatus and A. oryzae. The pathogenic species A. flavus, A. terreus and A. nidulans hydrolyse collagen and were found to secrete an alkaline protease related to that of Aspergillus fumigatus. In contrast, A. niger and non-pathogenic species such A. glaucus, A. versicolor and A. clavatus were unable to degrade collagen in vitro. These findings suggest a possible pathogenic role for the secreted alkaline proteases of Aspergillus species.",1993,7935565,no
Secretion of calf chymosin from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae.,"Active calf chymosin was secreted from Aspergillus oryzae transformants when the chymosin cDNA was expressed under the control of glucoamylase gene (glaA) promoter. Secreted prochymosin was autocatalytically activated to the chymosin (0.07-0.16 mg/l). Western blot analysis showed that a secreted protein immunoreactive with an anti-chymosin antibody was of similar size to authentic chymosin. Northern blot analysis revealed that mRNA of the chymosin cDNA was expressed at as high level as that of the glaA gene. The size and the level of the transcript were different among transformants, due to the integration position of the plasmid on the chromosome.",1993,7764387,no
Expression of the cellulase (FI-CMCase) gene of Aspergillus aculeatus in Escherichia coli.,FI-CMCase cDNA of Aspergillus aculeatus was expressed in Escherichia coli by using the tac promoter of E. coli. Transformants of E. coli harboring a plasmid pHEM06 containing mature form FI-CMCase cDNA produced FI-CMCase in the cytoplasm of the cells. The enzyme from E. coli cells was purified to yield 56% and it was immunological identical to that of FI-CMCase purified from A. aculeatus.,1993,7764343,no
Secretion of heterologous proteins by Aspergillus niger: production of active human interleukin-6 in a protease-deficient mutant by KEX2-like processing of a glucoamylase-hIL6 fusion protein.,"To develop improved methods for heterologous protein production in Aspergillus niger, we studied the secretion of human interleukin-6 (hIL6). Since in vitro experiments with culture medium revealed that hIL6 was rapidly degraded, several protease-deficient strains of A. niger were isolated and tested for reduced degradation of hIL6 compared with the wild-type strain. The mutant strain giving the least degradative effect on hIL6 (designated AB1.13) was transformed with several hIL6-expression plasmids. Initially, hIL6 was expressed using various signal sequences fused to the sequence of mature hIL6. The resulting transformants did not produce detectable amounts of hIL6, despite high transcription levels in one transformant. We hypothesized that hIL6 was not efficiently processed during passage along the secretion pathway. Therefore, hIL6 was expressed as a fusion protein with glucoamylase, a protein which is efficiently secreted by A. niger and expression of which can easily be measured enzymatically. To obtain mature hIL6, a sequence encoding the KEX2 cleavage-site (Lys-Arg) was inserted between glucoamylase and hIL6 sequences. Mature active hIL6 was found to be secreted in the extracellular medium. Using this combined approach of transforming a protease-deficient strain with a fusion construct containing the KEX2 site, up to 15 mg l-1 active hIL6 was obtained in shake-flask culture. A fusion construct without the KEX2 site resulted in substantially higher production of the fusion protein, but hIL6 was not active in the fused form. These results indicate that A. niger contains a protease with similar specificity as the KEX2 protease from yeast.",1993,7764298,no
IgG and IgA subclass antibodies against Aspergillus umbrosus in farmer's lung disease.,"Fifty patients with farmer's lung disease (FL), 20 asymptomatic exposed farmers, and 18 healthy controls were investigated for total IgG and total IgA, as well as subclass antibody levels against Aspergillus umbrosus, the most common fungus to which FL patients in Finland have been exposed. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed significantly elevated levels of specific total IgG and IgA antibodies in the sera of patients during the acute phase of the disease. Both IgG1 and IgG2 subclass antibodies and both IgA1 and IgA2 subclass antibodies were significantly associated with the disease. The antibody levels decreased during the first 3 months, when mould exposure was avoided and when an oral 6-week steroid treatment was administered. During the next 12 month follow-up, the mean antibody levels continued to decrease, even though re-exposure might have occurred. The results (with sensitivity 94% and specificity 95%) imply that in addition to the measurement of A. umbrosus-specific IgG, determination of both A. umbrosus-specific IgG1 and IgA might also be useful in the serodiagnosis of acute stage of FL.",1993,10780892,no
Optimized preparation of Aspergillus fumigatus extracts for allergy diagnosis.,Extracts of Aspergillus fumigatus are required for the measurement of specific antibodies that are important indices in the diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). This study investigated the effect of different culture conditions on the production and release of antigenic and allergenic proteins of A. fumigatus. Increasing the incubation temperature from 25 degrees C to 37 degrees C altered the production of proteins by the mycelium which resulted in the release of a greater number of proteins that reacted with precipitating antibodies. Static sporulating cultures produced a much wider antigenic spectrum than shake cultures although the number of precipitating proteins (5 and 3 respectively) and major IgE binding proteins (5 and 3 respectively) was not greatly altered. The widest range of proteins bound by precipitating antibody or IgE from ABPA serum were released into the culture filtrate during 28 day static incubation at 37 degrees C. The resultant extract proved useful for screening patients for specific IgE and will provide a starting material for the identification of individual antigens or allergens.,1993,10780890,no
Local and systemic antibody production in horses affected with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,"An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to quantify isotype-specific antibody to Micropolyspora faeni and to Aspergillus fumigatus in the sera and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of normal horses, horses with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and horses with other chronic respiratory diseases. Elevated antibody levels were not detected in the sera of affected horses. However, both IgE and IgA antibody to both allergens was significantly elevated in BALF in COPD affected horses sampled both when symptomatic and asymptomatic. Elevated levels were also found in animals that developed a chronic cough after an acute onset with symptoms compatible with a respiratory virus infection. In one animal a ten fold increase in IgE antibody to the two allergens developed after an interval of 7 weeks. These findings are supportive of a central role of local IgE antibody to mould allergens in the immunopathogenesis of COPD, and also suggest that respiratory viral infection may predispose to the development of COPD in some horses.",1993,8291200,no

New cause for false-positive results with the Pastorex Aspergillus antigen latex agglutination test.,"The Pastorex Aspergillus antigen test for detection of Aspergillus galactomannan antigen in the sera of patients with invasive aspergillosis is used in many clinical laboratories. A serum sample contaminated with Penicillium chrysogenum gave a strongly positive reaction (1:128) which was heat stable, was not eliminated by pronase treatment, and was not detected by a normal rabbit globulin control. This observation was shown to be due to cross-reactions of the monoclonal antibody EB-A2 used by the kit with several airborne fungi likely to contaminate serum samples, including Penicillium chrysogenum, Cladosporium herbarum, Acremonium species, Alternaria alternata, Fusarium oxysporum, Wangiella dermatitidis, and Rhodotorula rubra.",1993,8408572,no
Allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis caused by Pseudallescheria boydii.,"Two cases of allergic bronchopulmonary pseudallescheriosis (ABPP) are described. These are the first cases of this allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPM) reported in which the clinical and serologic criteria are described. The first case was in a patient with mild asthma, and it resolved spontaneously after expectoration of a mucous plug. The second was in a patient with recurrent allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis with an exacerbation of ABPM caused by Pseudallescheria boydii. The total serum IgE, IgG, and IgE antibodies against P. boydii and the clinical picture well define ABPP.

Adiaspiromycosis: an unusual fungal infection of the lung. Report of 11 cases.,"Adiaspiromycosis (ad""i-ah-spi""ro-mi-kósis) is a worldwide, noninfectious, nonarthropod transmitted fungal infection of lower vertebrates, most commonly rodents. Humans become an accidental host by inhaling dust-borne spores (conidia) of the saprophytic soil fungus, Emmonsia crescens (recently renamed Chrysosporium parvum variety crescens). We report 11 cases of this unusual deep mycosis from South America, Europe, and the United States. The severity of the disease depends on the number of spores inhaled. In limited inoculum, the disease remains localized (two cases), whereas in heavy inocula the fungus involves both lungs (nine cases) and presents as a diffuse reticulonodular infiltrate. In this disseminated form, patients usually complain of cough, dyspnea on exertion, and low-grade fever mimicking other systemic fungal infections and tuberculosis. It is difficult to unmask the fungus because it is not easily cultured nor is there a reliable serologic test. Therefore, a biopsy is required and the pathologist must recognize the large (ranging in size from 50 to 500 microns), round, Gomori methenamine-silver nitrate and periodic acid-Schiff reagent-positive spherules with a trilaminar wall. The spherules can be surrounded by either suppuration, epithelioid granulomas with or without necrosis, or concentric, hyalinized fibrosis. In the latter chronic stage, the organism may collapse, forming a variety of sizes and shapes thereby resembling other fungi, helminths, mineral particles, or inhaled pollen grains. Clinically, the infection most commonly regresses spontaneously, but may persist, or rarely progress, requiring surgical intervention with limited resection to attain cure.",1993,8352373,no
Inoperable pulmonary aspergilloma: percutaneous CT-guided injection with glycerin and amphotericin B paste in 15 cases.,"Fifteen patients with active inoperable pulmonary aspergilloma underwent percutaneous injection of a special therapeutic paste of glycerin and amphotericin B. This paste was warmed just prior to injection, and filling of the lesional cavity was achieved in one session if it was possible to obtain anaerobic conditions for destruction of the aspergilloma. Injection was performed with computed tomographic guidance with use of an 18-gauge flexible needle and with administration of anti-coughing analgesia. Follow-up was continued for 7 months on average. Filling of the lesion cavities required three sessions on average because of cough or bronchospasm. In 12 cases the aspergilloma regressed within 3 months and results at serology became negative. In three cases, there was no change in the cavity, but hemoptysis did not recur. Results in this series confirm the feasibility and efficacy of this palliative treatment.",1993,8351356,no
Partial purification and characterization of mold antigens commonly found in foods.,"Rapid methods are needed for detection of molds in foods therefore, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed. The extracellular and mycelial antigens for Mucor, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, and Geotrichum species were partially purified and characterized. The molecular masses of the mycelial and extracellular antigens, as determined by size exclusion chromatography, ranged from 4.5 x 10(5) to 6.7 x 10(5) Da. There was only one main antigenic peak separated by Sepharose CL-4B and concanavalin A-Sepharose columns for Mucor, Cladosporium, and Geotrichum mycelial and extracellular antigens, but there were two for Aspergillus mycelial antigens and three for Aspergillus extracellular antigens. These antigens contained 10 to 50% protein which was part of the active site since protease digestion significantly decreased antigenic activity. Neutral sugars, ranging from 13 to 75%, made up the rest of the active site, and < 1% phosphate was detected in mycelial antigens. Geotrichum, Cladosporium, and Aspergillus antigens contained mainly glucose, galactose, and mannose. Mucor antigens contained these sugars plus fucose. The percentage of sugars differed between the mycelia and extracellular antigens. Enzymatic digestion and competitive inhibition tests using different sugar derivatives showed that galactosyl residues with beta linkages were immunodominant for Aspergillus, Geotrichum, and Cladosporium antigens and mannosyl residues with alpha linkages were immunodominant for Mucor antigens.",1993,8368845,no
Detection of galactomannan and the 18 kDa antigen from Aspergillus fumigatus in serum and urine from cattle with systemic aspergillosis.,"Serum and urine samples from cattle with experimental and spontaneous systemic mycotic infections were tested for the presence of galactomannan and the 18 kDa antigen from Aspergillus fumigatus by an inhibition ELISA and immunoblotting, respectively. High levels of galactomannan (approximately 80 ng/ml.) were detected in serum from two of three calves experimentally infected with A. fumigatus. In two out of three cows with spontaneous acquired aspergillosis a similar amount of galactomannan was detected. Galactomannan was not found in serum samples of 20 cows which aborted due to either experimental or spontaneous placental aspergillosis. Twenty-four of forty urine samples from normal cattle reacted positively in the ELISA, consequently, the assay was not applicable on bovine urine. The 18 kDa antigen from A. fumigatus was detected in the urine from one calf out of three calves experimentally infected with aspergillosis and in the urine from one cow with spontaneous aspergillosis. It is concluded that detection of galactomannan in serum and the 18 kDa antigen in urine may be used as an aid for the diagnosis of disseminated bovine aspergillosis with the exception of placental and probably gastrointestinal localization.",1993,8284952,no
[Invasive aspergillosis in patients with malignant hemopathies. Usefulness of direct and serologic diagnosis].,"To evaluate the efficacy of different diagnostic methods for invasive aspergillosis (IA) in patients with haematologic neoplasms.Eight patients were evaluated for this study (5 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, 2 acute leukaemias, and 1 chronic myelogenous leukaemia in blastic crisis). Depending on the clinical characteristics of each case, one or more diagnostic procedures were used: (a) microscopic observation of fresh samples from sputum, urine sediment, or fine-needle aspirate (b) culture in Sabouraud agar, glucose-gentamicin medium of the pathologic productsThe combination of microbiological methods (i.e., direct observation, culture, serology) provided the IA diagnosis in the 8 cases, this being confirmed by histologic observation in 5 instances (3 of them in necropsy studies). The observation of fresh samples allowed us to identify hyphae on different locations, although the culture of such material not always was positive. Seroconversion for Aspergillus spp was seen in 4 patients, whereas the antigen detection was negative in the 5 patients in whom this was attempted.(1) These findings suggest that different microbiological techniques must be combined for IA diagnosis when suspected in a severely compromised patient. (2) Direct microscopic observation may be of help, as it is a simple method allowing faster results than culture. (3) Serologic techniques, especially circulating antigen detection, are not fully developed.",1993,8235942,no
Serum IgG antibodies to mold spores in two Norwegian sawmill populations: relationship to respiratory and other work-related symptoms.,"Wood trimmers and planing operators from two separate sawmill populations (N = 303 and 170) were studied by serology assessment and a self-administered questionnaire. IgG antibodies to Rhizopus microsporus ssp. rhizopodiformis, Paecilomyces variotii, and Aspergillus fumigatus were measured by ELISA. The questionnaire included questions about general respiratory symptoms and symptoms after handling moldy timber. Personal exposure of wood trimmers to mold spores and wood dust was measured in one part of the sawmills. R. microsporus was the most prevalent mold assessed by serology. Antibody levels were higher and symptoms suggestive of mucous membrane irritation, chronic nonspecific lung disease, allergic alveolitis, and organic dust toxic syndrome were more frequently reported by wood trimmers than by planing operators. The mean level of IgG antibodies to R. microsporus in sawmill workers working in the same work area was the best predictor of symptoms in both populations. The consistent results indicate that exposure to spores of R. microsporus may cause several respiratory symptoms in wood trimmers.",1993,8213847,no
Coccidioidomycosis.,"Coccidioidomycosis is a systemic fungal infection endemic to the southwestern United States and other parts of the western hemisphere. Although producing a wide range of disorders in healthy persons, immunosuppression predisposes to especially severe disease. Thus, a knowledge of the pathogenesis of coccidioidal infections and its relation to the normal immune responses is useful to understand the diversity of problems that Coccidioides immitis may cause. Diagnosis usually requires laboratory studies such as fungal culture or specific serologic testing. Fortunately, many patients do not need to be treated for the infection to resolve. Therapy for the more severe forms of coccidioidal infection was once limited to amphotericin B but now includes azole antifungal agents. These expanded alternatives now require physicians to weigh many factors in determining the best management for specific patients.",1993,8212681,no
Enzyme immunohistochemistry with mono- and polyclonal antibodies in the pathological diagnosis of systemic bovine mycoses.,"To improve the immunohistopathological diagnosis of systemic bovine mycoses, we have evaluated the utility of antifungal polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, and peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase staining techniques. A rabbit polyclonal antibody to mannan from Candida albicans was specific for candidosis. The diagnosis of aspergillosis was accomplished using a rat monoclonal antibody to the galactofuran side chains of Aspergillus galactomannan. A murine monoclonal antibody reacting with weakly Con-A binding 41 and 46 kDa somatic antigens from Absidia corymbifera was used for immunostaining of zygomycetic hyphae. Peroxidase antiperoxidase (PAP) and alkaline phosphatase antialkaline phosphatase (APAAP) complexes were visualized using aminoethylcarbazole and fast red substrates. A green staining of PAP reactions with dioctyl sulfosuccinate sodium and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (DONS/TMB) was effective for the demonstration of fungi in dual and triple infections. Tissue sections of experimentally infected mice were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the antibodies. Tissues obtained from 161 bovine mycotic lesions previously studied by indirect immunofluorescence staining were further evaluated using the three antibodies. In all of 45 lesions solely affected by aspergillosis and in three solely affected by candidosis the diagnoses were confirmed by the new evaluation. In 85 of 96 cases of single infections with zygomycetes the diagnosis was confirmed, while none of the antibodies reacted with fungal elements in the remaining 11 lesions. Aspergillus hyphae were detected in all three lesions with dual aspergillosis and zygomycosis, whereas zygomycetic material was confirmed in only two of these cases. A mixed infection of candidosis and zygomycosis in a lymph node was confirmed too. In 13 cases in which a diagnosis had not hitherto been obtained, aspergillosis and zygomycosis were recorded each in three cases.",1993,8398091,no
[Clinical study of patients with deep-seated fungal infection associated with hematological diseases].,"An assessment has been made regarding usefulness of measuring beta-D-glucan (beta-glucan) as fungal serodiagnosis in 50 cases of fungal infection with hematological diseases. Further, an assessment has been made regarding relation between hematological findings and therapeutic effect by administering miconazole, an antifungal agent (MCZ: Florid, clinically to the subjects. Positivity of beta-glucan (beta-glucan > or = 10 pg/ml) was observed in 54.5% (24/44), and the effective rate of MCZ in the positive cases was 75.0% (18/24). In the cases in whom fungus was detected, beta-glucan-positive rate was 50.0% (8/16), and MCZ-effective rate in beta-glucan-positive cases was 62.5% (5/8). The total effective rate of MCZ was 80% (40/50). Side effects were observed in 3 cases, but continual administration of MCZ was possible in all of the 3 cases. By the assessment regarding the relation between hematological findings and therapeutic effect of MCZ, it was found that the effective rates in the cases who underwent a transition with neutrophil and lymphocyte counts less than 500/microliters during the period of MCZ administration were 64.7% (11/17) and 50% (5/10), respectively, and large effects were observed in the cases who underwent a transition with the neutrophil and lymphocyte counts more than 500/microliters was 86.7% (19/22) and 91.7% (22/24), respectively. These results suggested that lymphocytes rather than neutrophils had an important role in the morbidity of fungal infection. It was noteworthy that MCZ was effective for the treatment of deep seated mycosis and significant effective rate was obtained in the group of patients who had neutrophils and lymphocytes less than 500/microliters.",1993,8360523,no
Evidence of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity in allergic fungal sinusitis.,"Despite documentation of specific immunologic hypersensitivity in a few case reports, controversy continues as to the role of allergy versus true infection in the clinical entity of allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS). Using a modified radioallergosorbent test (RAST) to multiple fungal antigens, 16 patients meeting the histologic criteria of AFS and with positive fungal cultures were compared to 5 control patients with similar preoperative clinical findings but without histologic or culture evidence of AFS. All patients were immunocompetent and none demonstrated histologic evidence of tissue invasion. All AFS patients were RAST-positive to at least one fungal antigen in the family of their cultured organism with positive defined as class 2 or greater. No control patient was RAST-positive to either dematiaceous or Aspergillus fungal antigens. Thus, modified RAST testing can aid in the routine clinical diagnosis of AFS, and it provides further serologic evidence for a type I hypersensitivity in the pathogenesis of AFS.",1993,8341095,no
Complement binding to Aspergillus conidia correlates with pathogenicity.,"Complement has significant effects on the phagocytosis of Aspergillus organisms. We examined the amount and type of complement component C3 bound to the resting conidia of 29 isolates from nine Aspergillus species. The highly pathogenic species A. fumigatus and A. flavus bound fewer C3 molecules per unit of conidial surface area than did the less pathogenic species A. glaucus, A. nidulans, A. niger, A. ochraceus, A. terreus, A. versicolor, and A. wentii, as determined by quantitative flow cytometry. Immunoblot analysis of C3 fragments bound to conidia demonstrated that for all species most C3b was apparently converted to iC3b. For seven species, iC3b was clearly the major C3 product recognized by immunoblotting. However, A. niger and A. nidulans appear to promote further breakdown of opsonic C3 fragments to C3dg. We found significant variations in size and C3 binding among isolates within the same species. Intraspecies variation may contribute to seemingly discrepant results obtained in studies of Aspergillus phagocytosis.",1993,8320488,no
"Application of enzyme-immunohistochemistry for the diagnosis of aspergillosis, candidiasis, and zygomycosis in three lovebirds.","Aspergillosis, candidiasis, and zygomycosis were diagnosed in tissues from three lovebirds (Agapornis roseicollis) using indirect enzyme-immunohistochemical techniques. In these techniques, the first antibody was raised against fungal antigen. A second antibody, which was raised in another animal species, was added to link the first antibody to enzyme-immunocomplexes. The reactivity of specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies was visualized by immunoreactivity of alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase and peroxidase anti-peroxidase immunocomplexes. All three birds examined had dermal candidiasis. In addition, one of the birds was diagnosed with concomitant acute ocular aspergillosis, and another bird was diagnosed with chronic zygomycotic myocarditis.",1993,8257396,no
Typing by immunoblot of Aspergillus fumigatus from nosocomial infections.,"Forty-four isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus from patients with nosocomial aspergillosis and their hospital environment were collected and typed by immunoblot. Laser densitometric analysis of the profiles and homology studies within each case were performed which established relationships between patient and environmental types and showed that patients are often contaminated by several types of A. fumigatus, not all necessarily responsible for the mycosis. One of the cases appeared to be a typical clonal hospital-acquired infection. This typing technique seems to represent a powerful tool to determine the origin and mode of spread of nosocomial aspergillosis.",1993,8114802,no
The mucosal and systemic response to phosphorylcholine in mice infected with Trichinella spiralis.,"The presence of phosphorylcholine (PC) in Trichinella was confirmed by ELISA and Western blot experiments with the PC-specific myeloma TEPC-15. Anti-PC antibody production was detected in ELISA by cross-reaction with the PC-positive somatic polysaccharide of Aspergillus and the synthetic conjugate phosphorylcholine-bovine serum albumin conjugate and by inhibition with phosphorylcholine chloride (PCCl). The kinetics of the serum and mucosal anti-PC immunoglobulin response were determined following infection of CFW mice. Anti-PC IgA was a minor fraction of the serum response. In primary infections IgG binding to Trichinella antigen was partially inhibited by PCCl incubation, but by Day 6 following challenge infections, incubation with PCCl did not reduce IgG binding. PCCl incubation also reduced serum IgM binding to Trichinella antigen following primary infections, and in contrast to IgG, a reduction occurred following challenge infection as well. Following primary and challenge infections PCCl incubations also reduced bile IgA binding to Trichinella antigen. The kinetics and subclass distribution of the anti-Trichinella PC response were equivalent to the group I response reported for synthetic PC-protein conjugates. Anti-PC IgA production indicates that class switching occurred without maturation of the response. Immunization by feeding Trichinella antigen plus cholera toxin, in contrast to infection with larvae, did not affect anti-PC antibody production following infection. Since the response was not anamnestic and the serum IgG response was not downregulated, larval infection and antigen feeding differ in the anti-PC responses they induce. The anti-PC response does not appear to be protective in Trichinella infections in mice.",1993,8513878,no
Mycotoxigenic potential of Aspergillus flavus strains isolated from groundnuts growing in Israel.,"Two hundred strains of the Aspergillus flavus group isolated from groundnuts (peanuts) growing in Israel were examined for their ability to produce mycotoxins in potato dextrose (PD) broth. Almost 77% of the isolates produced aflatoxin aflatoxins B1 and B2 were formed by most of the isolates. Simultaneous production of aflatoxins of groups B and G was detected in only 0.5% of the isolates. Microscopic examination revealed that 98% of the isolates were A. flavus and only 2% A. parasiticus. Cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) was detected in 22.5% of the isolates, including 3.5% that produced only CPA. Sterigmatocystin was detected in only 2% of the isolates and only one isolate produced aflatoxin simultaneously with CPA and sterigmatocystin. The dry weight (DW) of mycelium, 7 days after inoculating the medium, was between 71-110 mg/30 ml medium in more than 70% of the isolates. A general decrease in the pH was observed and 75% of the isolates reduced the pH to 4.5 or below. After 14 days, a small increase in DW and an increase in the pH toward neutrality was observed. On PD agar, 30% of the isolates produced sclerotia, including 5% that produced them profusely. No correlation between mycelial growth, changes in pH of the medium, sclerotium formation, and aflatoxin accumulation could be observed. The mycotoxigenic potential of the A. flavus strains isolated from groundnuts seems to be relatively high and may present a potential threat to human and animal health.",1993,8413500,no
Salmonella and shigella bacteraemia in Zimbabwe.,"In patients with HIV infection, non-typhoidal salmonellae are a recognised cause of bacteraemia. This association was initially demonstrated in the United States, but has more recently been found in Kenyan patients. This prompted us to review the cases of patients with enterobacteriaceae bacteraemia admitted to Parirenyatwa Hospital, Harare. Non-typhoidal salmonella bacteraemia as compared with typhoid fever was significantly more common in HIV infected patients than in non-HIV infected patients (p < 0.01). It was also a cause of bacteraemia in patients with other immuno-suppressive conditions and in some patients without identifiable risk factors.The case notes of patients with blood cultures positive for enterobacteriaceae were examined retrospectively over a 6-month period in Parirenyatwa Hospital, Harare, Zimbabwe. Speciation was possible for Salmonella typhi and shigellae only. Nontyphoidal salmonellae were serotyped. Salmonella or shigella bacteremia was identified in 51 patients. There were 14 isolates of S. typhi, 32 isolates of nontyphoidal salmonellae, and 5 isolates of shigellae species. The case notes of 38 patients could be identified for review, and of these HIV serology was available for 15 seropositive and 15 seronegative patients. The male to female ratio was approximately 3:1 for both groups and the mean age was 29.7 +or- 21. Nontyphoidal bacteremias as compared with typhoid fever were strongly associated with HIV seropositivity [p  0.01]. 3 out of 8 HIV-negative patients with nontyphoidal bacteremia had another underlying immunosuppressive disease [2 had myeloma and 1 patient had cirrhosis with complicating hepatoma]. 2 patients with nontyphoidal bacteremia whose HIV status was unknown also had another immunosuppressing disease [acute myeloid leukemia and idiopathic pancytopenia]. 13 out of 15 HIV-positive patients showed other signs of HIV infection [oral candida, herpes zoster, persistent generalized lymphadenopathy]. 3 out of 11 patients [27%] with typhoid died, while 11 out of 27 patients [40.7%] with nontyphi bacteremia died. Most strains of S. typhimurium were included in serogroup B, which accounted for 37% of nontyphoidal isolates. Earlier studies identified invasive salmonellosis in patients with other AIDS defining diseases. In Nairobi clinical features of HIV infection were found in 64% of bacteremic HIV-positive patients, but only 28% of patients fulfilled the CDC clinical case definition for AIDS. A more recent study from Nairobi demonstrated that S. typhimurium bacteremia is a common cause of intercurrent infection in HIV-positive tuberculous patients.",1993,8131197,no
Airborne dust and aeroallergen concentration in a horse stable under two different management systems.,"Airborne dust concentration (ADC) was measured in 2 different horse management systems using an Andersen cascade impactor in the box-stall, and a personal Marple cascade impactor attached to the halter to measure ADC in the breathing zone. The levels of aeroallergens implicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were measured by radioallergosorbent-inhibition immunoassay. A conventional management system (System C) utilising hay feed and straw bedding, and a recommended environment (System R) utilising wood shaving bedding and a complete pelleted diet were studied. In the stall, total and respirable ADC (geometric mean) were significantly higher in System C (2.55 mg/m3 0.44 mg/m3, respectively) than in System R (0.70 mg/m3",1993,8508749,no
Evaluation of serological methods for determination of specific IgE in diagnosis of aspergillus lung disease.,"Forty six patients clinically suspected to have aspergillus lung disease [bronchial asthma 17, allergic broncho-pulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) 22, aspergilloma 7] were evaluated by Phadebas RAST, Phadezym RAST (ELISA) and avidin-biotin ELISA for determination of specific IgE. Smear, culture, skin test against aspergillin, precipitin test and Enzygnost (total IgE) confirmed the diagnosis in 7 patients of extrinsic asthma due to conidia of Aspergillus spp., 17 for ABPA and 7 for aspergilloma among the clinically suspected patients. Specific IgE against Aspergillus fumigatus antigen was detected in 100 per cent patients of extrinsic asthma and 64.7 per cent of ABPA patients. No specific IgE could be detected in patients with aspergilloma. In patients other than those with, aspergilloma the detection rate of specific IgE was 50.0 per cent by radio-allergosorbent test (RAST), 62.5 per cent by ELISA, 66.7 per cent by avidin-biotin ELISA. Thus ELISA or avidin-biotin ELISA could replace the radioimmunoassay procedure for detection of specific IgE.",1993,8406634,no
Murine monoclonal antibodies to glycoprotein antigens of Aspergillus fumigatus show cross-reactivity with other fungi.,"Six monoclonal antibodies produced against Aspergillus fumigatus were studied for their cross-reactivity against other fungal antigens from related and unrelated organisms. Five of the monoclonal antibodies reacted with glycoprotein antigens as evidenced by their binding to concanavalin A, although one did not react with concanavalin A. The reactivities of the monoclonal antibodies with various antigens were studied by biotin-avidin linked immunosorbent assay and Western blots. The results indicate that two monoclonal antibodies (Asp D1 and Asp C9) react with antigens from aspergilli as well as other fungi including Penicillium notatum and Candida albicans, whereas three of six antibodies (Asp H10, Asp ILB8, and Asp C2B1) react with A. fumigatus antigen only. Hence, these monoclonal antibodies can be used to obtain group specific and species specific antigens for various immunodiagnostic assays.",1993,8354480,no
[Bronchopulmonary aspergillosis].,"Case histories of 510 patients operated on for chronic destructive pulmonary tuberculosis and mycetoma are analyzed, as are the findings of examinations of 56 patients with cavitary forms of lung involvement (mostly cavernous and fibrocavernous tuberculosis), whose resected lung and bronchial specimens were inoculated to detect the fungi. X-Ray and tomographic examinations were carried out according to the routine methods. Blood serum IgG antibodies to aspergillosis antigen were determined in the enzyme immunoassay. The pathologic material (sputum, bronchial lavage water) was studied in tissue cultures and the pathomorphologic findings analyzed. An x-ray symptom of the foamy nuclear (septal) structure of pulmonary shifts was revealed, that represents a sort of a pathologic tissue response in one of bronchopulmonary aspergillosis forms. This condition was confirmed by high (over 1:1600) values of enzyme immunoassay with aspergillosis antigen.",1993,7618240,no
[Pulmonary complications after bone marrow transplantation].,"Pulmonary toxicity occurs in approximately 10 to 50% of patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Bacterial pneumonia very commonly affects patients within the first 6 months post-BMT. Etiologic factors include neutropenia and the presence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Pulmonary fungal infections, due to candida and aspergillus, may develop in 16% of patients receiving BMT, with a high mortality rate, being about 80%. A prolonged neutropenia as well as GVHD and associated immunosuppressive treatments are important factors in predisposing a patient to develop fungal pneumonitis. Interstitial pneumonitis occurs in 10-40% of patients herpes viruses are the most commonly documented cause, with cytomegalovirus (CMV) being the most common pathogen. No causative organism is identified in up to 60% of the cases. It is likely that some of these cases may result from drug or radiation toxicity. Lung shielding and fractionation of the dose have decreased the incidence of interstitial pneumonitis to less than 5%. Patients with GVHD are predisposed to lung infections because of the immunosuppression that accompanies GVHD and its treatment. In addition, GVHD itself appears to have a direct effect on pulmonary epithelium. Cultural and serologic studies as well as radiographic investigations and other diagnostic procedures (ie bronchoalveolar lavage) are needed for appropriate management of pulmonary complications.",1993,8355644,no
Mushroom worker's lung: serologic reactions to thermophilic actinomycetes present in the air of compost tunnels.,"Vast numbers of spores of the thermophilic actinomycetes Excellospora flexuosa, Thermomonospora alba, T. curvata and T. fusca were collected from the air in fermentation tunnels during the spawning of mushroom compost, i.e. over 10(9) CFU m-3 of air. Five different genera of fungi, namely, Aspergillus, Aureobasidium, Cladosporium, Penicillium and Scytalidium, were found at only 10(3) CFU m-3 of air. Agaricus bisporus, used for spawning, was absent. Sera of 10 mushroom growers affected by Mushroom Worker's Lung (MWL) were tested by a qualitative dot-ELISA for antibodies against the spores of these micro-organisms. All 10 were positive for one or more of the actinomycetes E. flexuosa, T. alba, T. curvata and T. fusca. No antibodies were found against Streptomyces thermovulgaris, Thermoactinomyces vulgaris and T. sacchari nor against the fungi Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicillium brevicompactum, P. chrysogenum, Scytalidium thermophilum and Trichoderma viride. Sera of 11 of 14 workers engaged in routine spawning of compost in tunnels reacted positively with 1 or more of the actinomycetes. Their 10log serum titres increased with the duration of employment to an upper limit of 2.5. The sera of 19 non-exposed individuals were negative. Because high numbers of spores of E. flexuosa, T. alba, T. curvata and T. fusca were present in the air that was used for successful inhalation provocation of mushroom workers with MWL and because of the elevated serum titres of these workers, we presume these organisms to contribute in the occurrence of MWL.",1993,8326995,no
Investigation of possible adverse allergic reactions to mycoprotein ('Quorn').,"Mycoprotein ('Quorn') is a food produced for human consumption from Fusarium graminearum. Crossreactivity studies showed that mycoprotein shared multiple common allergenic determinants with Aspergillus fumigatus and Cladosporium herbarum and some with Alternaria alternata. There is, therefore, a potential for mould allergic patients to react adversely to inhaled or ingested mycoprotein. Mycoprotein RAST screening of mycoprotein production workers was made during a 2 year period. Two of the production workers had specific RAST binding > or = 2% but none reported symptoms. Two of 10 patients referred to hospital following vomiting and diarrhoea after ingestion of mycoprotein had a mycoprotein skin-prick test weal > or = 2 mm but none had a significantly raised RAST. These largely negative results are important and reassuring because consumption of the product in the U.K. is now widespread and increasing.",1993,8319120,no
Production and characterization of a monoclonal antibody to a major concanavalin A--nonbinding antigen of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"A hybridoma secreting immunoglobulin G1 antibody was produced against Aspergillus fumigatus. In this study we used interleukin-4 as a growth factor to augment the survival and multiplication of immunoglobulin G1-secreting hybridomas. The antigen recognized by this monoclonal antibody is a low-molecular weight concanavalin A-nonbinding component of A. fumigatus. The monoclonal antibody affinity-purified antigen showed specific reactivity with serum from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, whereas all allergic asthmatic patients with skin-test reactivity to A. fumigatus demonstrated only low levels of antibodies similar to those in normal control subjects. This antigen failed to show cross-reactivity with other fungal antigens. These results indicate that this monoclonal antibody can be used for the purification of specific antigens useful in the immunodiagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.",1993,8445291,no
Immunoblot analysis of Aspergillus fumigatus antigen with human antibodies and lectin probes.,"Components of culture filtrate antigen of Aspergillus (A.) fumigatus were electrophoretically separated, transferred to hydrophobic durapore membrane, and then probed with patients' sera and lectins. Using human sera from patients with aspergilloma and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), more than 13 IgG binding components were identified. IgG binding to high molecular weight components (HMW) of over 30 kDa was observed in all patient sera tested, but IgG binding to low molecular weight components (LMW) of approximately 18 kDa was observed in 7 out of 8 patients' sera which showed a positive precipitin reaction by means of counterimmunoelectrophoresis. Concanavalin A and lens culinaris agglutinin showed strong binding to HMW but no binding to LMW. Further, strong IgE binding to the 18 kDa component was observed in serum from a patient with ABPA during the acute stage, but not during the convalescence stage. It is suggested that the 18 kDa protein from A. fumigatus is the primary antigen in the serological antibody responses observed in patients with aspergilloma or ABPA.",1993,8507937,no
A brief history and discussion of certain mycotic infections and their importance to physicians.,"Mycotic infections are common and their incidence is increasing. They can be difficult to distinguish from other infections, particularly tuberculosis, but there are numerous clinical clues that can help suggest the presence of systemic mycoses. Histoplasma skin tests, serologic tests, and agent isolation can aid in the confirmation of a fungal infection. Clinical considerations must be put in the proper perspective before a definitive treatment is proposed. Specific chemotherapy is often curative.",1993,8469086,no
[Treatment of experimental invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in rats with liposomal amphotericin B].,"Liposomal amphotericin B was evaluated for toxicity, pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic efficacy in invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in Sprague-Dawley rats. The protective effect of liposomes against the toxicity induced by repeated amphotericin B infusions was observed in a survival study of rats, thereby allowing higher dosages to be administered. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that liposomes led to high levels of amphotericin B in the spleen and liver. Drug levels in the lung were higher at ten minutes after intravenous injection of liposomal amphotericin B at 20 mg/kg than of free amphotericin B at 1.5 mg/kg. Efficacy was assessed in rats treated with cortisone acetate, fed a low-protein diet and infected transtracheally with 8 x 10(4) Aspergillus fumigatus spores to cause fetal pneumonia and pulmonary bleeding. Dosages of 20 or 4 mg/kg of liposomal amphotericin B, or 1.5 mg/kg of free amphotericin B were administered intravenously to rats once daily for 8 days. Control rats received saline. Twenty mg/kg of liposomal amphotericin B was as effective on survival rate as 1.5 mg/kg of free amphotericin B. However, 4 mg/kg of liposomal amphotericin B was less effective than 1.5 mg/kg of free amphotericin B, prolonging the mean survival time of rats treated with saline, which showed elevation of galactomannan antigen titers of Aspergillus fumigatus in sera and invasive proliferation or mycelia with bleeding in histopathological sections of the lung. We conclude that liposomal amphotericin B reduces toxicity of the drug, thereby increasing the concentration of the drug in the lung by high-dose administration, but decreases the efficacy of the drug in experimental pulmonary aspergillosis.",1993,8468494,no
Polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic mobility of alkaline proteinase produced by Aspergillus flavus isolated from a penguin.,"The electrophoretic mobility of alkaline proteinase produced by four isolates from a penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) was same in all of them and was consistent with that of Aspergillus (A.) flavus NRRL 1957 used as a reference strain, but not consistent with that of A. parasiticus NRRL 2999.

Experimental systemic bovine zygomycosis with reference to pathology and secretion of antigen into urine.,"ELISA and immunoblotting were applied for the characterization of somatic antigens from Absidia corymbifera. Immunoblotting revealed major antigenic bands at 11 to 81 kDa. The ELISA showed some crossreactivity towards somatic antigens from other fungi. However, the crossreactivity was especially observed with somatic antigens from other fungi of the zygomycetes. The ELISA and immunoblotting assays were applied to urine samples from two groups of 3 calves each systemically infected with A. corymbifera and Aspergillus fumigatus, respectively. The immunoreactivity of the urine samples was similar by the two assays. Somatic antigens were demonstrated in the urine of all three calves infected with A.corymbifera, whereas only one of the calves with systemic aspergillosis was antigen positive.

Loss of function mutations in bimA cause cells to arrest growth with condensed chromatin and a short, metaphaselike mitotic spindle. bimA is a member of a gene family defined by a repeated motif called the Tetratrico Peptide Repeat (TPR), which is found in genes from bacteria, yeast and insects. Several yeast TPR genes are also required for mitosis, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC27 and Schizosaccharomyces pombe nuc2+, which appear to be functional homologs of bimA. We have developed antisera specific to the bimA protein (BIMA) and have characterized BIMA by western blot and immunocytochemical analyses. BIMA is heterogeneous in apparent molecular weight, consisting of a major 90-kD species and at least two minor species of approximately 105 kD. The results of BIMA localization by immunofluorescence microscopy depend on the level of BIMA expression. Overexpression of BIMA, which had no deleterious affect on growth or mitosis, resulted in localization of BIMA on or throughout most nuclei. Nuclear staining was granular, and overlapped but was not completely coincident with DNA staining by DAPI. In contrast, when expressed at normal levels, BIMA colocalized with the spindle pole body (SPB). BIMA localized to the SPB in a cell cycle independent manner. These results show that BIMA is either associated with or is a component of the SPB, and they suggest that BIMA functions at the spindle poles to promote the onset of anaphase.",1993,8432735,no
Inhaled aeroallergen and storage mite reactivity in a Wisconsin farmer nested case-control study.,"A nested case-control study was undertaken to assess the role of antibody (Ab) to a panel of antigens associated with hypersensitivity pneumonitis in the development of lung disease among Wisconsin dairy farmers. Immunologic reactivity to a panel of inhaled allergens was assessed in the Ab+ cases and compared to the Ab+ control, Ab- control, and Ab- blue-collar control subjects by skin tests, RAST assays, and a modified American Thoracic Society questionnaire. The most prevalent allergens among the cases as determined by either skin test or RAST assays were the house dust mites (HDM) (21.6%), storage mites (11.2%), grain smuts (11.2%), Cladosporium (7.5%), Aspergillus (6.0%), and cattle (5.2%). No other allergens appeared to be different from in nonfarming populations. Of the storage mite reactors, IgE to Lepidoglyphus destructor (7 of 8) was the most frequently found, followed by Tyrophagus putrescentiae (6 of 8), Glycyphagus domesticus (5 of 8), Chortoglyphus arcuatus (5 of 8), and Acarus siro (2 of 8). L. destructor was also isolated from the farm of one of the cases. There was no difference in the total IgE levels among the groups. Reactions to HDM, storage mites, and grain smuts were significantly more frequent among the cases (p < 0.05). We conclude from this study that there is a significant increase in reactivity to certain inhaled allergens among those dairy farmers reporting barn-associated respiratory symptoms that is unrelated to past exposure to the causative agents of farmer's lung disease.",1993,8430958,no
Treatment of canine nasal aspergillosis with enilconazole.,"Twenty-four dogs with nasal aspergillosis were treated with enilconazole (10 mg/kg bid for 7-14 days) administered topically through tubes surgically implanted into the nasal chambers. Aspergillosis was eliminated in 19 dogs over a median follow-up period of 18 months. Another dog died, but at necropsy there was no evidence of causative fungus. Two of the four dogs that were not cured had infection of periorbital soft tissues. An additional seven dogs received 6 weeks ketoconazole (5 mg/kg bid PO) and enilconazole therapy topically. Six of these dogs were disease-free over a median follow-up period of 35 months. The seventh dog responded to repeated treatment with enilconazole. Twenty-six of the 29 dogs (90%) without extranasal aspergillosis were cured.",1993,8455182,no
Characterization of Aspergillus umbrosus carbohydrate antigens by biotinylated lectins and IgG response to mannan/mannoprotein antigens in patients with farmer's lung.,"Twenty-one different biotinylated lectins were used to recognize the carbohydrates of Aspergillus umbrosus, one of the most common microbes that patients with farmer's lung in Finland are exposed to. The glycoprotein fraction of A. umbrosus was bound especially well by Concanavalin A and consisted mainly of carbohydrates mannose and glucose. The carbohydrate fraction of A. umbrosus antigens were isolated from the crude extract of A. umbrosus with Con A-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Serum IgG antibodies to A. umbrosus mannoprotein fraction were determined in 57 patients with farmer's lung, 10 asymptomatic exposed farmers and 10 healthy controls by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan were used as controls. Patients had high levels, whereas asymptomatic exposed farmers showed moderate, and health controls low levels, of IgG antibodies to the A. umbrosus mannan/mannoprotein fraction. There were no significant differences in the mean antibody levels between the patients and controls against C. albicans or S. cerevisiae mannose fraction although in all groups more antibodies were detected against C. albicans than S. cerevisiae.",1993,8439816,no
Prophylaxis and treatment of infection in the bone marrow transplant recipient.,"Considerable progress has been made in the prophylaxis and treatment of infections in the bone marrow transplant recipient. Much of this progress is related to the availability of many new antimicrobial agents and biological products, as well as to an improved understanding of the pathogenesis of infections. Because of the expense associated with many of these agents and products, defensive strategies against infections must consider not only effectiveness but also cost (Table 16.9). It is now possible that a marrow transplant recipient could receive as many as five or six different prophylactic agents. While the use of an oral fluoroquinolone or oral fluconazole for prevention of serious bacterial and fungal infections is relatively inexpensive, the price of intravenous immune globulin and GM-CSF is considerably higher. Their routine use in all patients may not be economical. The results from ongoing trials comparing different dosing regimens of intravenous immune globulin and selectively using GM-CSF or G-CSF only in patients with suspected or documented infection will be important (80,173). On the other hand, the cost of providing CMV-seronegative blood products or prophylactic ganciclovir is justified by the high morbidity and mortality of CMV interstitial pneumonia in allotransplants. The low incidence of CMV disease in syngeneic transplants and autotransplants, however, makes CMV prophylaxis unnecessary. Similarly, in view of a recent controlled trial showing no benefit of intravenous immune globulin for prophylaxis of infections, intravenous immune globulin is also not needed in autotransplants. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is cheap prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, but the very low mortality from herpes simplex infection makes acyclovir a very expensive prophylaxis. Treatment options for the infected bone marrow transplant recipient have also become broader. The decline of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacillary infections and the availability of newer, more potent beta-lactam drugs makes monotherapy an appropriate and more cost-effective regimen for empiric therapy of many febrile patients. The introduction of fluconazole, itraconazole, and other newer antifungals offers promise for improving antifungal therapy, but these agents should not take the place of amphotericin B in a critically ill patient with suspected or documented fungal infection until results of ongoing controlled trials show equivalent efficacy. The role of biological response modifiers like macrophage colony-stimulating factor in the treatment of fungal infections also needs to be defined. Development of clinically applicable serologic tests for early detection of specific Candida or Aspergillus antigen is badly needed to help guide antifungal therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1993,8397916,no
Recombinant Aspergillus fumigatus allergen I/a (rAsp f I/a) in the diagnosis of Aspergillus related diseases.,"A. fumigatus allergen I/a (rAsp f I/a) was produced in Escherichia coli, affinity purified by Ni(2+)-chelate chromatography and refolded. rAsp f I/a binds IgE of A. fumigatus-allergic individuals as shown by ELISA, dot blots and Western blots. In addition, rAsp I/a elicited positive immediate type I skin reactions in individuals allergic to A. fumigatus but not in control individuals. Hence, rAsp f I/a can be used as a standardized antigen/allergen for an improved serological and clinical diagnosis of A. fumigatus-associated diseases.",1993,8368157,no
IgG subclass response to Aspergillus fumigatus.,"The exact clinical meaning of the IgG subclass antibodies remains obscure. In order to contribute to the study of the IgG subclass response, specific IgGtotal and IgG subclass antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in three groups of patients: 30 asthmatics due to an IgG-mediated hypersensitivity to Af, 30 atopic and 30 nonatopic controls. The results demonstrated that Af-specific IgGtotal, IgG2 and IgG4 antibodies are increased in Af-sensitive patients, although detectable levels of each specific IgG subclass could be found in all the three groups. No differences between atopic and non-atopic controls could be demonstrated.",1993,8324389,no
[Evaluation of mycologic and myco-serologic studies of materials derived from the respiratory tract of patients in the years 1986-1990].,"The material for mycological studies consisted of 7146 samples of respiratory tract material derived from 7764 patients (6495 samples of sputum, 235 bronchial rinsings and 416 throat smears). Serological studies were performed with 684 samples of serum by application of indirect immunofluorescence (IF) and gel immunodiffusion (ID) tests. Candida- like fungi in amounts which were diagnostically significant (10(6) cells/ml) were found in 16.7% samples of sputum. among fungi isolated from sputum there were 14 species of Candida- like fungi, mainly C. albicans (76%) and 7 species of moulds (including A. fumigatus-0.7%). Fungi were isolated from bronchial washings in 23.4% of samples. Among the isolated strains, 12.6% of Candida albicans were resistant to 5-fluorocytosine and 14.1% were resistant to amphotericin B. Antibodies against C. albicans by application of both IF and ID were found in 2.2% samples of serum. Antibodies against A. fumigatus were present in 11.6% of samples.",1993,8309310,no
[Semi-invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Apropos of a case].,"A 43-year-old man was admitted to hospital for excavated pneumopathy of the upper part of the right lung, revealed by signs of respiratory infection evolving for a few weeks and involving a 10-kg weight loss. The radiological and clinical evolution and the demonstration of Aspergillus fumigatus allowed establishing a diagnosis of semi-invasive aspergillosis. The treatment, associating amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine, replaced by itraconazole 15 days later, soon produced clinical healing and radiological improvement. Since serology remained positive, surgery was performed to remove the residual lesions after a 7-month course of itraconazole. Within the scope of this case, the diagnostic criteria of this form of pulmonary aspergillosis are discussed, as well as the merits and limitations of itraconazole.",1993,8296152,no
Immunological methods for the detection of structural components and metabolites of bacteria and fungi in blood.,"This review compares the clinical usefulness of immunological methods for the detection of structural components and metabolites of bacteria and fungi. Bacterial antigens (especially those of Mycobacterium, Neisseria, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Chlamydia, and Brucella) are best detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Methods involving antibodies are more expensive and are effective only when performed in series. The detection of antibodies that recognize S aureus teichoic acid merely confirms the presence of a metastatic complication. Tissue invasion by Candida albicans is not yet reliably detectable by the presence of a specific antigen. Simple, but not completely reliable methods are available such as the latex test for mannans detection and/or agglutination with liposomes for detecting 48-kDa cytoplasmic protein antigen and an assay for detecting enolase antigen. A latex agglutination test has also been developed for the mannans antigen of Aspergillus and for Cryptococcus neoformans capsular polysaccharide the latter test is more cost effective. The sensitivity of both tests is improved by serial assays. A negative finding with hemagglutination-based antibody tests rules out C albicans infection, and titers of 1/640 or higher have been associated with disseminated infection by Aspergillus. Concentrations of C albicans blastopore antigen antibodies higher than 400 IU/ml can be seen in disseminated candidiasis. High concentrations of endotoxin are indicative of imminent septic shock. Some biological indicators (C reactive protein, angiotensin converting enzyme, fibronectin, elastase-alpha 1-antitrypsin complex, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6) have been used to rule out a bacterial cause of fever.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1993,8214814,no
An inducible expression system for the production of human lactoferrin in Aspergillus nidulans.,"The production and secretion of human lactoferrin (hLF) in Aspergillus nidulans is described. The hLF cDNA was expressed under the control of the strong ethanol-inducible alcohol dehydrogenase (alcA) promoter. Recombinant hLF (re-hLF) is produced at levels up to 5 micrograms/ml. Approximately 30% of the re-hLF produced in this system is secreted into the growth medium. The re-hLF is indistinguishable from native hLF with respect to size and immunoreactivity. Furthermore, re-hLF is functional by the criterion of iron-binding capacity. The A. nidulans expression system offers an inexpensive, convenient method for the controlled production of mg amounts of biologically active mammalian glycoproteins.",1992,1452033,no
"Inhalant allergens in asthmatic children in Taiwan: comparison evaluation of skin testing, radioallergosorbent test and multiple allergosorbent chemiluminescent assay for specific IgE.","The multiple allergosorbent chemiluminescent assay (MAST-CLA) is a method for measuring total and allergen-specific IgE in human serum by a chemiluminescent immuno-enzymatic system. To compare the results of MAST tests with those of radioallergosorbent (RAST) and skin tests as an adjunct to the diagnosis of inhalant allergens in Taiwan, 195 asthmatic children, aged 5 to 15 years, were studied. All MAST tests had valid positive and negative control threads. The most important allergens in our patients were the two mite species: Dermatophagoid pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoid farinae (87.5% and 82.1%, respectively). There were also large responses (MAST-CLA class > or = 2) to the cockroach mix (28.45%), Alternaria (24.3%), and Eucalyptus (32.6%). The individual efficiency percentage between MAST-CLA and skin tests was D. pteronyssinus 91%, D. farinae 88%, cockroach mix 85%, feather mix 75%, dog dander 64%, Candida 75%, Aspergillus 79%, Alternaria 88%, ragweed mix 62% and Eucalyptus 76%. Comparison of the results of allergen-specific IgE measured by MAST-CLA and RAST were also significantly correlated for all four allergens (D. farinae, Candida, Alternaria and grass mix, r = 0.79-0.92). MAST-CLA was randomly duplicated and proven reproducible in 89% of the tests. Changes between positive and negative results occurred in only 3.6% of the tests. MAST-CLA is a simple in vitro test for specific IgE to 35 allergens, which compares favorably with RAST. It is concluded that MAST-CLA and RAST are similar in their ability to measure allergen-specific IgE, and correlate equally well with skin tests and clinical history in asthmatic children.",1992,1363631,no
Respiratory allergy to Aspergillus-derived enzymes in bakers' asthma.,"Baking and food industry workers are exposed to several powdered Aspergillus-derived enzymes with carbohydrate-cleaving activity that are commonly used to enhance baked products. We describe a retrospective study of sensitization to fungal alpha-amylase and cellulase on bakers. Five bakers in whom respiratory allergy symptoms developed when they were exposed to bread ""improvers"" that contained fungal alpha-amylase and cellulase were investigated by in vivo and in vitro tests. Type I hypersensitivity to these enzymes was demonstrated in the five patients by means of skin testing, histamine release test, positive reverse enzyme-immunoassay for specific IgE antibodies, and bronchial provocation test response to alpha-amylase or cellulase or both. Isolated immediate and dual responses to the bronchial challenge tests with these enzymes were observed. Immunoblot analysis with use of a pooled serum identified IgE-binding components in both enzymes. In the reverse-enzyme immunoassay-inhibition assays cross-reactivity between alpha-amylase and cellulase was not found, but some degree of cross-reactivity between alpha-amylase and A. oryzae, and between cellulase and A. niger was demonstrated. Four of the patients were also sensitized to cereal flour. Aspergillus-derived enzymes used as flour additives can elicit IgE-mediated respiratory allergy, and this fact has to be considered in the diagnosis and clinical management of bakers' asthma.",1992,1281180,no
"Selective expression of a major allergen and cytotoxin, Asp f I, in Aspergillus fumigatus. Implications for the immunopathogenesis of Aspergillus-related diseases.","Asp f I is a major 18-kDa Aspergillus fumigatus allergen and a member of the mitogillin family of cytotoxins. The nucleotide sequence of the Asp f I gene was determined by sequencing polymerase chain reaction products amplified from A. fumigatus spore DNA. The entire 678-bp DNA includes an 81-bp leader sequence, preceding the N-terminal alanine codon, a 52-bp intron, and a 444-bp open reading frame, encoding a 149-amino acid protein (M(r) 16,899), which is 99% homologous to mitogillin from Aspergillus restrictus. A mAb-based ELISA was used to compare Asp f I levels in spores, mycelia, and culture filtrate, and to determine the kinetics of allergen production. Disrupted hyphae or spore extracts had a 1000-fold lower level of Asp f I than culture filtrate, suggesting that germination of spores and growth of the fungus are essential for allergen production. Asp f I levels in A. fumigatus and A. restrictus peaked at day 3 (0.87 to 12.1 micrograms/ml), however, the allergen was not detected in Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus terreus, and Aspergillus nidulans cultures (< 1.5 ng/ml) on either days 3 or 8. Northern analysis confirmed that Asp f I mRNA was detected only in A. fumigatus and A. restrictus, but not in the other four Aspergillus spp. Asp f I-specific DNA was generated after polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic mycelial DNA obtained from A. fumigatus and A. restrictus, but not from the other Aspergillus spp. The results show that Asp f I is selectively expressed in A. fumigatus, and suggest that this cytotoxin could be a specific virulence factor for A. fumigatus.",1992,1431110,no
Laboratory aids in the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis.,"The laboratory diagnosis of candidiasis continues to be problematic however, there have been several advances in the past decade which promise to enhance our ability to identify patients at high risk for infection and/or to document invasive candidiasis in critically ill and immunocompromised patients. The introduction of commercially available biphasic blood culture medium and subsequently the lysis-centrifugation procedure has markedly improved the ability of laboratories to detect fungemia. Although serologic methods have not been very successful in diagnosing candidiasis in immunocompromised patients, several antigen detection methods are now under investigation. In addition, detection of fungal metabolites such as D-arabinitol remains promising. Finally, application of the techniques of molecular biology for typing and detection of fungal pathogens has expanded our understanding of candidal infections and may offer the most sensitive and specific means of diagnosing invasive candidiasis.",1992,1480209,no
Specific serum immunopatterns in clinical phases of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"Immunoblotting, radioallergosorbent test (RAST), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed to determine specific IgE and IgG responses to Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) allergens (IgE-Af IgG-Af). Serology results were compared in patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) (n = 43), patients with Aspergillus fumigatus-associated asthma (Af-asthma) (n = 26), and healthy individuals (n = 3). In patients with different clinical phases of ABPA, three specific immunopatterns were found by immunoblotting. It is proposed to classify ABPA into the active, intermediate, and remission phase with respect to the specific immunoresponse to Af-allergens and asthma symptoms. First, the active phase of ABPA is characterized by a fully developed specific immunoresponse to Af-allergens and severe asthma. Second, the intermediate phase includes patients with elevated specific immunologic findings without asthma symptoms. Third, the remission phase is characterized by a weak specific immunoresponse to Af-allergens after a long-term asymptomatic period. No correlation occurred between specific immunopatterns and irreversible brochopulmonary lesions. The IgE-Af RAST and IgG-Af ELISA titers of patients with ABPA in the active and intermediate phase were significantly higher compared with patients with ABPA in remission phase and with patients with Af-asthma. In particular, the demonstration of positive IgG-Af ELISA titer generally allows the serologic discrimination of patients with asthma and ABPA from patients with Af-asthma in clinical practice. The present study revealed that immunoblots of most patients with Af-asthma were negative. Immunoblotting demonstrated an IgG reactivity exclusively to low molecular weight (MW) Af-allergens in 8 out of 26 patients with Af-asthma and in the three healthy individuals, and this IgG response may reflect naturally occurring antibodies.",1992,1401642,no
Tracheal aspergillosis in 6 1/2-week-old chickens caused by Aspergillus flavus.,"A case of localized tracheal aspergillosis in 6 1/2-week-old single-comb white leghorn pullets caused by Aspergillus flavus is documented. Yellow caseous plaques adherent to the mucosal surface of the tracheas were observed grossly. In several tracheas, the plaques occluded the lumina, and the surrounding tracheal walls were reddened. Histologically, the mucosa was necrotic and infiltrated with macrophages, and fibroplasia was evident in the subadjacent tracheal wall. The lumen of the trachea was almost completely occluded by a combination of fungal mycelia and pyogranulomatous exudate. Portions of tracheal cartilage were elevated into the lumen of the trachea. Other than a sudden increase in mortality to 0.5% per day, there was no evidence of disease in the flock. Depletion of bursal lymphocytes, with concomitant cryptosporidiosis, was evident on histological examination. Acute infectious bursal disease was diagnosed in the succeeding flock at this ranch based upon serology and typical histology.",1992,1485863,no
New structural features of the antigenic extracellular polysaccharides of Penicillium and Aspergillus species revealed with exo-beta-D-galactofuranosidase.,"To study the structures of the epitopes of the extracellular polysaccharides from Penicillium and Aspergillus species, an exo-beta-D-galactofuranosidase was purified from a commercial crude enzyme preparation from Trichoderma harzianum. Analysis of ring size and linkage position of the galactose residues of the extracellular polysaccharide of Penicillium digitatum, before and after enzymatic treatment, was determined by the reductive-cleavage technique. In addition to terminal and beta (1-5)-linked galactofuranosides, beta (1-6)-linked and beta (1,5,6)-linked branched galactofuranose residues could be identified. After degradation with the purified exo-beta-D-galactofuranosidase, all initial linkages of the galactofuranose residues were still present, but the amount of beta (1-5)-linked galactofuranose residues had decreased considerably. Treatment of the extracellular polysaccharides of Penicillium and Aspergillus species with the purified exo-beta-D-galactofuranosidase resulted in complete disappearance of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reactivity of these polysaccharides, using immunoglobulin G antibodies raised against P. digitatum. Therefore, with the use of this enzyme, it was proved that the beta (1-5)-linked galactofuranosyl residues only are responsible for the antigenicity of the extracellular polysaccharides of Penicillium and Aspergillus molds. A new structural model for the antigenic galactofuranose side chains of the galactomannan from P. digitatum is proposed.",1992,1383191,no
Characterization of endopolygalacturonase (EC 3.2.1.15) from Aspergillus niger as glycoprotein by electrophoretic methods and lectin affino-blotting.,"Chromatographically purified endopolygalacturonase (PG) from Aspergillus niger was deglycosylated with N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) and characterized by means of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-electrophoresis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) without denaturing agents, isoelectric focusing (IEF) and lectin affino-blotting. The results show that PG, which is apparently homogeneous in SDS-PAGE but heterogeneous in IEF and PAGE, consists of at least two polypeptide chains with different glycosylation patterns. The component with the higher electrophoretic mobility is deglycosylated with PNGase F and reacts with concanavalin A (Con A) and Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA), indicating a ""high mannose"" or ""hybrid""-type of glycoprotein (GP). The other component may contain O-glycosidically linked mannose, N-acetylglucosamine or glucose.",1992,1459118,no
Pathology of common pulmonary fungal infections.,"The incidence of fungal pneumonias has increased dramatically since the 1960s, particularly in immunocompromised patients. Fungal infections may be divided into endemic and opportunistic varieties. In general, the truly pathogenic (endemic) fungi infect healthy individuals, and opportunistic fungi usually infect only immunocompromised hosts. Almost all common fungal infections are acquired by inhalation of contaminated soil, resulting in pulmonary infections. Once in the lungs, the fungi elicit tissue responses ranging from acute exudative reactions to granulomatous reactions. The pulmonary lesions may resolve, progress to a prolonged chronic course, or disseminate to other organs, resulting in systemic infections. The diagnosis of fungal infection depends on the demonstration of the organisms by culture or histology serologic tests may confirm the diagnosis. Fungi in tissues can be identified by hematoxylin and eosin stains, but special stains such as Gomori's methenamine silver and periodic acid-Schiff reagent are often required for diagnosis.",1992,1404540,no
Activity of recombinant mitogillin and mitogillin immunoconjugates.,"A synthetic gene for the Aspergillus protein toxin mitogillin has been synthesized and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant mitogillin is a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis in vitro with an IC50 of 9.7 pM. Immunoconjugates of recombinant mitogillin derivatized with S-acetylmercaptosuccinic anhydride and 5-methyl-2-iminothiolane modified H65 antibody kill T cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells expressing the human CD5 surface antigen. Native mitogillin contains 4 cysteine residues which form two disulfide pairs (Fernandez-Luna, J. L., Lopez-Otin, C., Soriano, F., and Mendez, E. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 861-867). Three derivatives of mitogillin have been assembled which substitute alanine residues for cysteine residues 5, 147, or 5 and 147. Each of these molecules retains the ability to inhibit protein synthesis in vitro with at most a 2-fold reduction in activity. The derivative mitogillinC147A can be conjugated to 5-methyl-2-iminothiolane- modified H65 antibody directly without pretreatment with S-acetylmercaptosuccinic anhydride, and the immunoconjugate is active against HSB2 cells. Genetic manipulation of toxin genes to expose an accessible cysteine residue into a recombinant product can thus be used to generate immunotoxins without initial derivatization by nonspecific cross-linking reagents.",1992,1644844,no
Isolation and characterization of mutants of Aspergillus niger deficient in extracellular proteases.,"In the present study, the extracellular protease activity in a strain of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger was investigated and mutant strains deficient in the production of extracellular proteases were isolated. The major protease, which is responsible for 80-85% of the total activity, is aspergillopepsin A, a protein of ca. 43 kDa, the activity of which is inhibited by pepstatin. In addition, a second protease, aspergillopepsin B, is produced, which is much less sensitive to inhibition by pepstatin. Several protease-deficient mutants were obtained by in vivo UV mutagenesis. In addition, a mutant lacking aspergillopepsin A was constructed by an in vitro gene replacement strategy. In this mutant, AB1.1, the entire coding region of the gene for aspergillopepsin A (pepA) is deleted. In three UV-induced mutants, aspergillopepsin A is also missing. One of these mutants, AB1.18, is mutated in the pepA gene, which is located on chromosome I. One of the other mutants, AB1.13, which has only 1-2% of the extracellular protease activity in the parent strain, is deficient in both aspergillopepsin A and aspergillopepsin B. The mutation involved, prt-13, has been localized to chromosome VI, and is probably a mutation in a regulatory gene. Another mutation involved in loss of protease function, prt-39, is located on chromosome VIII. Degradation of various heterologous proteins in culture media of the mutants is reduced but, even in strain AB1.13, not completely abolished.",1992,1508158,no
[Limulus test (factor G) and polysaccharides from fungus].,"Picogram quantifies per ml of endotoxin showed a positive limulus test. The concentration more than ten pg/ml of curdlan ((1-3)-beta-D-glucan) was also positive to a conventional limulus test, which contains a factor G. One nanogram per ml of CM-curdlan was positive, but higher concentration of 10 pg/ml of CM-curdlan decreased its optical density of the conventional limulus test. More than one hundred ng/ml of mannan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae did not react with factor G. However, a culture supernatant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae activated factor G. This result suggested that beta-glucan activated factor G. In addition, culture supernatant of Aspergillus fumigatus, Rhodotorula rubra, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei also activated factor G, but Cryptococcus neoformans did not activate it.",1992,1402105,no
Cloning and expression of recombinant Aspergillus fumigatus allergen I/a (rAsp f I/a) with IgE binding and type I skin test activity.,"Aspergillus fumigatus secretes an 18-kDa nonglycosylated IgE-binding protein. This protein was previously shown to be a ribotoxin, like alpha-sarcin and mitogillin. A 686-bp long A. fumigatus cDNA encoding an 18-kDa ribotoxin was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with six adjacent histidines (rAsp f I/a). rAsp f I/a was purified to homogeneity by Ni(2+)-chelate affinity chromatography and refolded. The recombinant protein was enzymatically active resulting in the cleavage of 28S rRNA within a universally conserved region. rAsp f I/a was cytotoxic for EBV immortalized or PHA stimulated human PBMC. Furthermore, rAsp f I/a was recognized by murine mAb made against an 18-kDa ribotoxin. IgE of individuals allergic to A. fumigatus bound to rAsp f I/a as shown by ELISA, dot blots, and Western blots. rAsp f I/a elicited positive immediate type I skin reactions in individuals allergic to A. fumigatus but not in healthy control individuals. The results show that rAsp f I/a has similar functional characteristics when compared to the native 18-kDa ribotoxin. rAsp f I/a expressed in E. coli can therefore be used as a standardized Ag/allergen for serologic and clinical diagnosis of A. fumigatus-associated diseases.",1992,1624793,no
Isolation and antigenicity of a 45-kilodalton Paracoccidioides brasiliensis immunodominant antigen.,"In the present study, we analyzed human antibody responses to Paracoccidioides brasiliensis cellular antigens by the immunoblot technique to identify specific cellular components and to investigate the existence of antigen profile differences among serological responses of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) patients. Among the 64 PCM serum samples analyzed, a relatively homogeneous immunoglobulin G response to P. brasiliensis antigens was observed. The polypeptide with a mass of 45 kDa was the most clinically important, since antibody to this antigen was detectable in 90.6% of PCM patients studied and the six individuals who did not produce antibody were either at the end of treatment or in the posttherapy period and had shown clinical recovery. These facts suggested that the presence of this antibody may be an indicator of active disease. The 45-kDa antigen was also the most specific antigen of the PCM humoral immune response, since it reacted with only 2 of 79 (2.5%) heterologous serum samples tested: 1 histoplasmosis case and 1 tuberculosis case. This polypeptide was isolated from gels by electroelution and, when tested by an immunoradiometric assay and immunoblotting, maintained its reactivity with PCM sera and also with anti-P. brasiliensis polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits at the same sensitivity levels as those obtained in immunoblotting with a crude antigen. Since in our assays the 45-kDa polypeptide was the major P. brasiliensis antigen and seemed to be specific for PCM, its use in alternative diagnostic methods is promising, especially in patients suspected of having the juvenile clinical form of PCM often associated with negative double-immunodiffusion results.",1992,1612736,no
Production and localization of restrictocin in Aspergillus restrictus.,"The production and secretion of restrictocin (a cytotoxin that cleaves ribosomal RNA) by cultures of the fungus Aspergillus restrictus was investigated. Previous studies have indicated that restrictocin production in liquid culture coincides with the appearance of differentiated cell structures. A study of the correlation between the appearance of differentiated structures and restrictocin production was conducted with A. restrictus grown on agar medium. Restrictocin was found to be associated with the cell mass of the agar-grown culture (in contrast to liquid cultures), and was first observed when aerial hyphae emerged. Restrictocin levels increased until the time of conidiation, after which they fell off sharply. No restrictocin could be found in the agar medium. The presence of restrictocin upon and within various cell structures was determined by immunofluorescent laser microscopy. This study showed that restrictocin became localized to the conidiophores and phialides during the process of conidiation. Prior to this, restrictocin was found within the hyphae in localized concentrations that may correspond to secretory vesicles.",1992,1512575,no
Regulation of restrictocin production in Aspergillus restrictus.,"The production of restrictocin (a cytotoxin that specifically cleaves ribosomal RNA) by cultures of Aspergillus restrictus grown in liquid medium was investigated. The function of restrictocin, the method of its accumulation and the mode of resistance to restrictocin in A. restrictus are unknown. Previous studies have indicated that restrictocin accumulates in the medium with culture age. These observations have been extended in this study by cloning the cDNA of the res gene and using this cDNA clone to probe the onset of messenger RNA synthesis in the cells. The results of the Northern analysis were compared to the production and accumulation of restrictocin and morphological differentiation of the cells in culture. Restrictocin was found in the medium at the same time that mRNA was detected in the cells. This suggests that the leader sequence encoded by the cDNA provides an efficient secretion system for the protein. Both the protein and the mRNA were detected coincident with the formation of differentiated cell structures. These structures develop into conidiophores with one layer of sterigmata and conidia forming from the sterigmata. These results suggest that restrictocin is either involved in the process of conidiation or is coordinately regulated with differentiation leading to conidiation.",1992,1512574,no
Characterization of the Aspergillus niger pelB gene: structure and regulation of expression.,"The nucleotide sequence of pelB, a member of the Aspergillus niger pectin lyase multigene family, has been determined. The pelB gene product, PLB, shares 65% amino acid identity with pectin lyase A (PLA) and 60% with pectin lyase D (PLD). Although growth of pelB multicopy transformants on pectin-containing media results in elevated pelB mRNA levels, pectin lyase B (PLB) is barely detectable. This is probably due to degradation of PLB by acid proteases, since multicopy transformants grown on pectin medium with a high concentration of phosphate, leading to a less rapid decline in pH, secrete detectable amounts of PLB. To produce PLB in high amounts under conditions where few other extracellular enzymes are present, we tried two strategies. Firstly, heterologous expression of the pelB gene in A. nidulans, and secondly, expression of the pelB gene under control of the constitutive A. niger pki promoter.",1992,1495474,no
[Development and use of a method of determination of specific immunoglobulin G based on immunoenzyme analysis in the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis].,Enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) was employed for determination of specific immunoglobulin G to Aspergillus fumigatus (A.f.). Culture filtrate of A.f. was used as antigen. Optimal conditions of ELISA were found. Serum of 138 asthmatic patients with total IgE level more than 500 PRU/ml were analysed for determining the limits of IgG to A.f. concentrations.,1992,1421313,no
Pathogenicity differences of multiple isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus in turkeys.,"Sixteen Aspergillus fumigatus isolates of environmental, mammalian, and avian origin were used to assess: 1) intra-air-sac inoculation as a viable challenge alternative to aerosol exposure, and 2) isolate variability in pathogenicity. Development of lesions, antibody response in survivors, mortality, and weight gains were assessed. Turkey poults were challenged with equal numbers of viable conidia. Total number of conidia given per experimental group varied markedly and did not influence mortality. Antibody response as measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and agar gel immunodiffusion test was erratic, although most poults with high antibody scores had marked lesions and low weight. Lesions were characterized by necrogranulomatous pneumonia and airsacculitis with marked visceral involvement. The source of the isolate was not a factor in mortality, although this was biased by the high numbers of isolates from birds with aspergillosis. The single environmental isolate produced no mortality.",1992,1417585,no
[Immunological reactions in patients with pulmonary aspergilloma].,"A 52-year-old man with pulmonary aspergilloma is reported. In immunoassays, type I, III and IV hypersensitivity reactions of Gell & Coombs were observed. The finding of such immunological reactions, especially type I hypersensitivity, has rarely been observed in this disease. The present study was performed to investigate these reactions, especially to determine whether type I allergy participates in pulmonary aspergilloma. We reviewed 126 cases of pulmonary aspergilloma reported in the Japanese literature between January 1980 and April 1991. The following results were obtained: Elevation of serum IgE was observed in 49% of the subjects examined, positive IgE RAST score in 28%, precipitating antibody against A. fumigatus in 79%, and positive lymphocyte stimulation test using A. fumigatus antigen in 68%. In conclusion, type I, III and IV hypersensitivity of Gell & Coombs appears to participate in pulmonary aspergilloma. The occurrence of type I hypersensitivity is not rare in this disease.",1992,1405104,no
Aspergillus epidural abscess and cord compression in a patient with aspergilloma and empyema. Survival and response to high dose systemic amphotericin therapy.,"A 57-yr-old man with a chronic lung cavity presumed to be related to ankylosing spondylitis and/or old cavitary tuberculosis presented with hemoptysis and rapidly developed lower extremity paresis and hypoesthesia. On chest radiograph he had a left upper lobe lesion suggestive of aspergilloma combined with a large left empyema with bronchopleural fistula. Serologic analysis demonstrated precipitins and very high titer IgG antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus antigens. Decompressive laminectomy from T1 to T5 was performed, with drainage of A. fumigatus culture-positive material from an epidural abscess compressing the spinal cord. Chest drainage was required for control of the empyema. With a total course of 3 g of intravenously administered amphotericin B, rehabilitative therapy, and chronic empyema drainage, he is now at home and ambulatory with assistance. He is also being followed by regular serum assays of IgG antibodies to Aspergillus proteins. We report the case of an apparent long-term survivor of a formerly lethal and/or nonreversible paraplegic condition. The critical factors compared with previous cases with a poor outcome would appear to be prompt neurosurgical intervention, restoration of a normal number of T-cells, effective long-term chest drainage, and high dose amphotericin treatment.",1992,1596022,no
"Aspergillus fumigatus: identification of 16, 18, and 45 kd antigens recognized by human IgG and IgE antibodies and murine monoclonal antibodies.","The immunochemical properties of antigens produced by Aspergillus fumigatus were investigated with biochemical purification techniques in conjunction with the production of murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and binding studies with human IgG and IgE antibodies. A. fumigatus antigens were partially purified by gel filtration and hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose. Two fractions that eluted with either 2 mol/L or 0.15 mol/L of NaCl demonstrated strong binding to human IgG and IgE antibodies. Immunoprecipitation analysis with IgG antibodies from six patients with different Aspergillus-related diseases demonstrated that the 2M and 0.15M fractions contained major antigens of molecular weight 18 kd (Asp f I) and 45 kd, respectively. The 125I-labeled 2M fraction was used to compare IgG antibodies to A. fumigatus in sera from 25 patients with Aspergillus-related diseases. IgG antibodies were significantly higher in patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (geometric mean, 437 U/ml) than in patients with asthma (geometric mean, 14 U/ml p less than 0.001), but undetectable (less than 5 U/ml) in 43/48 control subjects. A good correlation was found between levels of IgG antibodies to the 125I-labeled 0.15M fraction and the 125I-labeled 2M fraction in sera from 106 patients with cystic fibrosis (r = 0.77",1992,1607551,no
Immunohistochemical identification of Penicillium marneffei by monoclonal antibody.,"We present an experimental study on the immunohistochemical identification of Penicillium marneffei in paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed tissue. The monoclonal antibody EB-A1 detects a specific galactomannan that appears to have at least one epitope identical in P. marneffei and Aspergillus sp. This immunohistochemical approach could be useful in the diagnosis of a rare diseae, penicilliosis marneffei, which proves to be difficult to identify by conventional microscopy.",1992,1512093,no
Rat monoclonal antibodies against Aspergillus galactomannan.,"Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against Aspergillus fumigatus galactomannan were produced in rats. Seven of them, EB-A1 through EB-A7, were characterized in more detail. They were all immunoglobulin M antibodies, reacting in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with purified A. fumigatus galactomannan, with avidity constants of between 2 x 10(9) and 5 x 10(9)/M. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay inhibition experiments with modified galactomannan and synthetic oligomers of beta (1----5)galactofuranose demonstrated that the MAbs bound to an epitope located on the beta(1----5)galactofuranose-containing side chains of the galactomannan molecule. An identical or similar epitope also seemed to be present in other fungi. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy experiments with EB-A2 revealed the presence of the antigen in the fungal wall and inside the cell. Immunoblotting experiments demonstrated that the epitope recognized by the MAbs was a common oligosaccharide moiety of a wide range of intracellular and extracellular glycoproteins in A. fumigatus. The characteristics of the MAbs justify their use in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis by antigen detection.",1992,1375195,no
Correlation of pretransplant viral serology and complications of bone marrow transplantation.,"Latent herpes viruses such as herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and varicella zoster virus are often reactivated after bone marrow transplantation, giving rise to infections. In contrast, Epstein-Barr virus infections rarely occur. Significant mortality is induced especially by pneumonitis, most often caused by CMV. Immunosuppression and pancytopenia caused by CMV increase the risk of bacterial infections and invasive fungal infections. Herpes viruses may increase the risk of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Thus, immunity to several herpes viruses was associated with an increased risk of acute GVHD. Seropositivity for CMV in recipient and donor increased the risk of chronic GVHD. Herpes viruses were also associated with a decreased risk of leukemic relapse. CMV infection, asymptomatic CMV infection, and seropositivity for several herpes viruses were associated with a reduced incidence of relapse in different reports. In spite of this possible antileukemic effect, leukemia-free survival was unaffected by herpes virus immunity in recipients or donors.",1992,1322186,no
Class specific antibodies in serodiagnosis of farmer's lung.,"The aim of the present study was to determine which microbes and which immunoglobulin (Ig) classes should be included in tests to discriminate between patients with farmer's lung and reference persons. The sera of a group of farmer's lung patients and their spouses were measured for IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE antibodies against a panel of farmer's lung microbes. The concentrations of IgG, IgA, and IgE antibodies were higher in patients compared with their spouses. The patients were generally positive for antibodies of several Ig classes whereas the spouses had only either IgG or IgA antibodies. A test comprising the determinations of IgG antibodies against T vulgaris and IgA antibodies against A fumigatus would correctly group 94% of the cases in the Finnish farming population. The selection of microbes for other environments needs to be determined locally.",1992,1599871,no
Detection of Aspergillus and Penicillium extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) by ELISA: using antibodies raised against acid hydrolysed EPS.,"Species of the fungal genera Aspergillus and Penicillium produce immunologically active extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) in which galactofuranose residues are immunodominant. The antigenic determinant of the EPS of A. fumigatus, A. niger and P. digitatum could be removed by acid hydrolysis. Due to the hydrolysis of the EPS the immunological reaction between IgG anti-native EPS and hydrolysed EPS disappeared. Antibodies raised in rabbits against the acid hydrolysed EPS revealed new antigenic determinants that were exposed as a result of the acid hydrolysis. Immunological inhibitory experiments showed that the antibodies were no longer directed to galactofuranose residues. Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay, carried out with antibodies raised against the acid hydrolysed EPS showed that the antibodies against the acid hydrolysed EPS were more species specific in comparison with the antibodies against the native EPS.",1992,1497336,no
Immunohistologic diagnosis of systemic mycoses: an update.,"Fluorescent antibody, immunoperoxidase and gold-silver staining methods for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of systemic mycotic infections are currently performed in a few specialized laboratories. These methods have proved applicable to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues, and are reliable for identifying therein antigens of infectious dimorphic, monomorphic filamentous, and yeast-like fungal pathogens, i.e., Aspergillus spp., Blastomyces dermatitidis, Candida spp., Coccidioides immitis, Cryptococcus neoformans, Fusarium spp., Histoplasma capsulatum, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Pseudallescheria boydii, and Sporothrix schenckii. Most of the available reagents are derived from multiple adsorbed polyclonal antisera. However, problems occur in the production of uniform and standardized species- or genus- specific antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies, although promising, have to date not eliminated these problems. Immunohistologic methods will become more routinely used in clinical laboratories as these problems are resolved and more sensitive and specific reagents become commercially available.",1992,1397200,no
Abnormal humoral immune response to mucosal antigenic stimulation in patients with lung cancer.,"Previous studies have suggested an inverse relationship between atopy and cancer of mucosal surfaces. Atopy is classically assessed by detecting specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies against inhalant allergens. However, Platts-Mills recently proposed that atopy is the ability of an organism to recognize and to respond to limited doses of allergens presented at the mucosal level by producing not only IgE, but also immunoglobulin A and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. The authors compared the prevalence of atopy in 103 patients with lung cancer (a model of mucosal cancer), 51 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease matched for age, sex, and smoking habits with patients with lung cancer, and 102 healthy control subjects. The authors investigated whether the IgG response to antigens presented at the mucosal level, exacerbated in atopic subjects, might inversely be decreased in patients with lung cancer. Serum IgE antibodies against five common inhalant allergens (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus [Der p1], Aspergillus fumigatus, grass pollen, and cat and dog danders) were detected through a radioallergosorbent test assay. Serum IgG antibodies against allergens naturally presented at the mucosal level (respiratory mucosa with Der p1 and digestive mucosa with betalactoglobulin [BLG] and soya proteins [SP]) were measured through a solid phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test. Atopic status was assessed in 19 patients (18.4%) with lung cancer, 9 patients (17.6%) with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and 18 healthy control subjects (17.6%). Distributions of specific IgG levels were represented on frequency histograms after natural logarithmic transformation and showed reduced levels of anti-Der p1 and anti-BLG IgG in the cancer population compared with the control populations but similar levels of anti-SP IgG. Influence of sex, age, smoking habits, histologic type of cancer, and its extent could be excluded. The authors' results show no difference in the prevalence of atopy between the three groups. They document a selective, rather than general, defect in the immune response initiated at the mucosal level in patients with lung cancer, the most frequent mucosal cancer in man.",1992,1373339,no
Concanavalin A-nonbinding Aspergillus fumigatus antigen: a major immunogen in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"Humoral immune responses in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) have been well studied. However, reports of cell-mediated immune responses in ABPA are conflicting and not well documented, perhaps because well-characterized antigens are not available. In the present study, we assessed the role of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with ABPA in their ability to respond to both crude and semipurified Aspergillus fumigatus antigens by in vitro proliferation and immunoglobulin E synthesis. Eight patients with ABPA, eight patients with immediate wheal and flare skin reactivity to A. fumigatus, and ten healthy control subjects with nonreactive skin tests were included in this study. Four A. fumigatus antigens were tested in vitro. Antigens included culture filtrate, mycelial extract, concanavalin A-nonbinding, and concanavalin A-binding antigens. There was a wide range of response to each antigen by each group of subjects. However, PBMCs from patients with ABPA showed greater response to the antigens than did those from the healthy control subjects when evaluated by lymphoproliferation (tritiated thymidine uptake) and immunoglobulin E synthesis (isotype-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). The concanavalin A-nonbinding antigen fraction had the ability to specifically stimulate proliferation of PBMCs from seven of eight patients with ABPA and from four of eight skin-reactive subjects none of the healthy control subjects responded. Significantly high levels of immunoglobulin E were detected in unstimulated PBMC cultures from five patients with ABPA when compared with those from healthy control subjects. These results indicate that concanavalin A-nonbinding A. fumigatus antigens may be significant in the cellular immune response of ABPA",1992,1583388,no
Cloning and sequence determination of a cDNA encoding Aspergillus nidulans calmodulin-dependent multifunctional protein kinase.,"A partial cDNA encoding Aspergillus nidulans calmodulin-dependent multifunctional protein kinase (ACMPK) was isolated from a lambda ZAP expression library by immunoselection using monospecific polyclonal antibodies to the enzyme. The sequence of both strands of the cDNA (CMKa) was determined. The deduced amino acid (aa) sequence contained all eleven consensus domains found in serine/threonine protein kinases [Hanks et al., Science 241 (1988) 42-52], as well as a putative calmodulin-binding domain. The cDNA contained an intron, lacked an in-frame start codon, and was not polyadenylated. A full-length copy of CMKa was subsequently isolated from a lambda gt10 library of A. nidulans cDNA using a restriction fragment of the first clone as a probe. It contained an in-frame start codon, an open reading frame (ORF) of 1242 bp and was polyadenylated. The ORF encoded a protein of 414 aa residues with an M(r) of 46,895 and an isoelectric point pI = 6.4. These values are in good agreement with that observed for the native enzyme [Bartelt et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 (1988) 3279-3283]. When aligned to optimize homology, 29% of the predicted aa sequence of ACMPK is identical to that of the alpha-subunit of rat brain calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. ACMPK shares 40 and 44% identity in aa sequence with YCMK1 and YCMK2, respectively, two Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases recently cloned from Saccharomyces cerevisiae [Pausch et al., EMBO J. 10 (1991) 1511-1522]. Results of Southern analysis of restriction digests of genomic DNA indicate that ACMPK is encoded by a single-copy gene.",1992,1563634,no
Ocular pharmacokinetics of saperconazole in rabbits. A potential agent against keratomycoses.,"The ocular pharmacokinetics of saperconazole, an experimental lipophilic triazole with activity against filamentous fungi, including Aspergillus and Candida species, were evaluated in rabbits by radioassay. The drug was administered by topical, subconjunctival, and oral routes. Following a single 20-microL drop of 0.25% saperconazole in normal corneas, a mean (+/- SEM) peak level of 2.32 +/- 0.06 micrograms/g was achieved in 10 minutes. In débrided corneas, a peak level of 13.09 +/- 2.87 micrograms/g was achieved in 2 minutes. The drug was rapidly cleared from the cornea within 2 hours. The administration of 13 drops during 1 hour resulted in a threefold increase in normal corneal levels and in a sixfold increase in débrided cornea levels. Peak levels following subconjunctival injection in normal corneas (12.91 +/- 2.02 micrograms/g) were approximately twofold greater than those following sustained topical administration (6.19 +/- 0.16 micrograms/g) and, in débrided corneas, were a third higher than those following topical therapy in débrided corneas. Clearance was virtually complete by 8 hours. Levels following oral administration were low and probably subtherapeutic in all ocular tissues that were evaluated. Bioassay studies revealed that 44.17% of the drug in the cornea following topical administration was bioactive.",1992,1562266,no
Characterization of a monoclonal antibody (P40) against the 68 kD major allergen of Penicillium notatum.,"A monoclonal antibody (MoAb P40) against the 68 kD major allergen of Penicillium notatum (P. notatum) was obtained by immunizing the mouse with a crude extract of P. notatum. Analysed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, P40 reacted with two different isoforms of the 68 kD component of P. notatum with pIs of 5.4 and 5.5. In addition to P. notatum, P40 showed positive ELISA activity to Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) but not to components of six other fungi including Alternaria porri, Cladosporium cladosporoides, Aureobasidium pullulans, Fusarium solani, Rhizopus arrhizus and Candida albicans. Analysed by ELISA, MoAb P40 also showed positive activity to two (P. frequentans and P. roseopurpureum) of the 10 other Penicillium species and two (A. terreus and A. flavus) of the four other Aspergillus species tested. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting studies demonstrated P40 positive reactivity to components with MW of about 67 kD in all these Penicillium and Aspergillus species with positive ELISA activity to P40. Furthermore, immunoblotting activity of MoAb P40 to the 67 kD component of A. niger was also observed. The epitope of the 68 kD allergen of P. notatum recognized by MoAb P40 was resistant to treatment of periodate oxidation with concentration of NaIO4 up to 20 mM. This MoAb may thus be useful in the characterization and purification of the 68 kD allergen from crude extracts, and in the molecular cloning of allergen genes.",1992,1377093,no
An efficient expression system for a variant form of the cytotoxic protein alpha-sarcin in Escherichia coli.,"An efficient Escherichia coli system for the production of a variant form of the cytotoxic protein alpha-sarcin (delta Ala 1) has been constructed. cDNA encoded alpha-sarcin lacking N-terminal alanine was ligated with the bla signal peptide sequence (the signal sequence of E. coli beta-lactamase localizes the protein in the periplasm) and was inserted into an inducible bacterial expression vector pKTN2-2. When the plasmid introduced into E. coli was expressed in the presence of IPTG, the recombinant product accumulated in the periplasmic space. The product was purified by Affi-Gel Blue followed by Bio-Rex 70 column chromatography. Recombinant alpha-sarcin (delta Ala 1) displayed the properties similar to those of authentic alpha-sarcin isolated from Aspergillus giganteus with respect to its molecular mass and enzymatic activity in ribosomal inactivation. The amount of alpha-sarcin variant produced in the system was estimated to be 1.2 mg/l of culture.",1992,1562594,no
Inhibition of Aspergillus fumigatus elastase with monoclonal antibodies produced by using denatured elastase as an immunogen.,"In preparing monoclonal antibodies to the elastase from Aspergillus fumigatus, we found that the enzyme was weakly immunogenic in BALB/c mice. Antiserum titers were only 1:1,000 to 1:5,000, and hybridomas secreted nonspecific immunoglobulin M (IgM). Denaturing the elastase in 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate at 80 degrees C for 10 min prior to injection increased titers of antiserum against the nondenatured (native) enzyme 10-fold. Of eight hybridomas selected following immunization with the denatured enzyme, seven produced IgG reactive with the native enzyme and one produced nonspecific IgM. The nondenatured immunogen tested again yielded mainly IgM producers. Immunoblots and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that the IgG monoclonal antibodies were reactive with both the denatured and nondenatured fungal elastases none cross-reacted with human neutrophil elastase, porcine pancreatic elastase, or Pseudomonas elastase. Elastase-specific polyclonal antibody produced in mice inhibited elastase activity beginning at a molar ratio (antibody to elastase) of 4:1, and activity was completely inhibited at 14.5:1. Some individual monoclonal antibodies partially inhibited elastase, but certain pairs, at a molar ratio of each antibody to elastase of 5.4:1, acted synergistically to inhibit the activity completely.",1992,1541546,no
Laboratory methods for the diagnosis and confirmation of systemic mycoses.,"The concomitant use of culture and nonculture techniques for the diagnosis and confirmation of systemic mycotic infections is recommended and assessed. A diagnosis based upon a single specimen and method, especially when the results are negative, is not always conclusive. In many situations, a single specimen and test method cannot be relied upon for the diagnosis of a fungal infection. The testing of multiple or serial specimens with a battery of procedures increases the chances for establishing a rapid and definitive diagnosis. Positive cultures generally provide unequivocal evidence of infection. In the absence of such data, results obtained by the use of nonculture techniques such as direct examination, conventional and immunohistologic staining, exoantigen identification, DNA hybridization, immunodiffusion, complement fixation, enzyme immunoassay, and radioimmunoassay can allow detection and identification of the etiologic fungus or provide immunologic evidence of a specific fungal infection.",1992,1562691,no
"Serodiagnosis of candidiasis, aspergillosis, and cryptococcosis.","During the past decade, substantial progress has been made in the development of new approaches and methods for the serological diagnosis of the mycoses. Clinically relevant antigens have been adapted for use in immunoassays for the detection of specific antibodies, and methods that detect fungal antigens in body fluids have been progressively refined. Nevertheless, few of the novel serological techniques have as yet found widespread clinical use. Reasons for this apparent discrepancy include the paucity of clinical data that substantiate improved predictive value for disease of antibody tests that use specific immunodominant antigens. The usefulness of detection of antigenemia in invasive candidiasis and invasive aspergillosis has been limited by the rapid clearance of Candida mannan and Aspergillus galactomannan from serum, which results in only moderate sensitivity for disease. False-negative results are especially frequent when single serum samples are tested in cases where fungal infection is clinically suspected. The detection of antigen in samples of urine collected serially may circumvent this problem in the future. The limited dissemination of methods for the detection of fungal antigens is also due to the slow development of simple and reliable commercial kits.",1992,1562681,no
Antigenemia in paracoccidioidomycosis.,"Severe forms of paracoccidioidomycosis (Pcm) are accompanied by intense immunological involvement characterized by depression of the cell-mediated immune response and by high levels of antibodies in serum with no protective function. These changes can be reversed by antifungal treatment. It has been suggested that antigens of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis released into the circulation during the active phase of the disease may be involved in the genesis of the changes in the immune response. In the present study, we evaluated the antigenemia of patients with Pcm using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA-c) capable of detecting 6 ng of antigen per ml of serum. Twenty-seven of 88 serum samples tested gave positive results, with the highest frequency of positivity being detected in patients with the severe acute form of the disease these patients had the highest antigen levels (0.03 to 3.4 micrograms/ml). Follow-up of one case showed a correlation between antigen levels in serum and evolution of the disease. False-positive reactions were observed in sera from patients with histoplasmosis, aspergillosis, and cryptococcosis. The results indicate that the described method has potential for clinical application, especially with respect to the evaluation of disease activity. Quantification of fungal antigens in the serum of patients with active Pcm represents an objective parameter for the study of the physiopathology of the disease.",1992,1537906,no
[Exogenous allergic alveolitis: assessment of antigen-specific IgG antibodies using a new chemiluminescence method].,"The demonstration of elevated levels of antigen-specific IgG antibodies is of importance for the diagnostic workup of patients with a suspected hypersensitivity pneumonitis. We established a solid phase immunoassay for the determination of these antibodies based on chemiluminescence (CLIA). The CLIA demonstrated a low level of unspecific binding. The reproducibility of the CLIA was evaluated by calculating the intra- and inter-variation the variation coefficient was 4% (intra-variation) resp. 13% (inter-variation). Using the CLIA we quantified IgG antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus (A.f.), Micropolyspora faeni (M.f.) and Thermoactinomyces vulgaris (T. v.) in the sera of patients with farmer's lung (FL, n = 10), healthy farmers (n = 13) and normal volunteers without prior hay contact (n = 12). For all 3 antigens the antibody levels of patients with FL were significantly higher than the titers of the other groups. As a comparison all sera were tested with an established solid phase radioimmunoassay (RIA). Using the RIA a statistically significant difference could only be demonstrated between the antibody levels of patients with FL and of normal volunteers without prior hay contact and was limited to the antigens A.f. and M.f. Comparing the results achieved with both assays on a point by point basis there was a good correlation for the antigens A.f. (r = 0.69",1992,1372432,no
[Clinical approach to infection in patients with hematologic malignancy].,"Patients with hematologic malignancy are susceptible to infection because of the disease process and its treatment. Profoundly granulocytopenic patients are at increased risk of developing Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia, often with a fatal outcome. Therapy with one or two anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam antibiotics and an aminoglycoside in combination that were effective in vitro against the infecting organism proved to be superior, by one-week survival, to therapy with either one in vitro effective beta-lactam or aminoglycoside or inadequate drugs. On the other hand, treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor had no significant association with longer survival, although a favorable outcome was well correlated with an increase in the granulocyte count during therapy. An active mycobacteriosis was documented in 2% of all patients with hematologic malignancy. Dissemination occurred in half of them. The prognosis of tuberculosis was depended mainly on early diagnosis and treatment, while that for the atypical variety was largely influenced by the underlying disease. The frequency of deep fungal infection in patients with acute leukemia at autopsy increased progressively from 10% in 1970-1974 to 38% in 1983-1986, but it decreased somewhat to 29% in 1987-1989 after the introduction of empiric amphotericin B therapy in 1986. Early empiric antifungal therapy should therefore be started in granulocytopenic patients with fever refractory to antibacterial therapy, because of unreliability of the current serodiagnosis. A total protective isolation for patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was associated with a reduced incidence of pneumonia, especially due to Aspergillus, and to a lesser extent, bacteremia. Cytomegalovirus pneumonia complicating BMT continues to have a poor prognosis, although the frequency has gradually been decreasing with the introduction of effective preventive measures. An early diagnosis and treatment as well as preventive measures is thus necessary for infection control in patients with hematologic malignancy.",1992,1371045,no
Cloning of the alpha-amylase cDNA of Aspergillus shirousamii and its expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"alpha-Amylase cDNA was cloned and sequenced from Aspergillus shirousamii RIB2504. The putative protein deduced from the cDNA open reading frame (ORF) consisted of 499 amino acids with a molecular weight of 55,000. The amino acid sequence was identical to that of the ORF of the Taka-amylase A gene of Aspergillus oryzae, while the nucleotide sequence was different at two and six positions in the cDNA ORF and 3' non-coding regions, respectively, so far determined. The alpha-amylase cDNA was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under the control of the yeast ADH1 promoter using a YEp-type plasmid, pYcDE1. The cDNA of glucoamylase, which was previously cloned from the same organism, was also expressed under the same conditions. Consequently, active alpha-amylase and glucoamylase were efficiently secreted into the culture medium. The amino acid sequence of the N-terminal regions of these enzymes purified from the yeast culture medium confirmed that the signal sequences of these enzymes were cleaved off at the same positions as those of the native enzymes of A. shirousamii.",1992,1368777,no
[Evaluation of an ELISA for the detection of anti-Aspergillus fumigatus antibodies].,"An indirect MicroELISA system for the detection of anti-Aspergillus fumigatus antibodies using human anti-IgG conjugated to peroxidase was standardized. Serum samples of two patients having an aspergilloma diagnosed by clinical, microbiological, and serological criteria were used as positive controls. In addition, 119 serum samples of blood donors and 216 serum samples of patients having chronic pneumopathies were also studied. The standardized system may be used as a diagnostic complement for it is able to discriminate between antibody levels (IgG) in different clinical forms of aspergillosis and in those individuals having respiratory diseases which may favour the colonization by this pathogen.",1992,9768220,no
Analysis of Aspergillus fumigatus catalases possessing antigenic activity.,"Analysis of Aspergillus fumigatus water soluble fractions by electrophoresis on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (PAGE) showed the presence of at least three catalase bands. They were designated F, S1 and S2 in order of descending electrophoretic mobility with respect to the anode. The multiple enzyme forms appear to be distinct in their physicochemical properties. Enzyme bands S1 and S2 were simple catalases the F band had an additional peroxidase function. All of the components were antigenic and differed in their binding to specific antibodies raised in rabbits with separate fractions of A. fumigatus mycelium. When serum from patients with aspergilloma, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, cystic fibrosis and chronic asthma were pre-incubated with A. fumigatus antigens and analysed by PAGE, 17 of 26 samples either abolished or reduced catalase activity. Enzyme F was a non-Concanavalin A (ConA)-binding antigen",1992,1731061,no
Evaluation of clinico-immunological parameters in pediatric ABPA patients.,Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis patients (ten in the age group 5-13) were studied with respect to clinical and immunodiagnostic tests. All the patients showed wheal and flare reaction with A. fumigatus antigens. Clinical features included bilateral infiltration and hilar lymphadenopathy. Eosinophilic count in these patients was observed to be in the range of 300-2500/mm3. Sera of six patients indicated precipitin reaction with A. fumigatus antigens. An elevated total serum IgE was noticed in all the patients. A. fumigatus specific IgG and IgE antibodies were increased in these patients. Optical density of the sera of all the patients against controls were observed to be in the range of (0.426 to 1.8 for IgG and 0.147 to 0.562 for IgE) by ELISA. Western blot analysis indicated that there may be correlation between the clinical stages of the disease and immunological reactivity of the sera with various antigenic components.,1992,1612654,no
Quantitative evaluation of Langerhans cells in median rhomboid glossitis.,"Langerhans cells (LC) serve as antigen presenting cells and provide immune surveillance within epithelia. Since depression of LC number and/or function may allow tolerance to antigens, we evaluated LC in median rhomboid glossitis (MRG), a condition linked to persistent candidal infection of lingual mucosa. Material included a total of 36 cases of MRG (7 of which did not show PAS + fungi) and 6 controls. LC were identified by their expression of S-100 and HLA-DR antigens and quantified using image analysis. Equal numbers of LC were identified using S-100 + and HLA-DR + markers. The density of LC (cells/mm of basement membrane, mean +/- SD) in both PAS + MRG (2.6 +/- 1.3) and PAS-MRG (3.0 +/- 1.7) was markedly depressed compared with controls (17.2 +/- 6.4), (P less than 0.001). These findings indicate that the LC network is perturbed in MRG, and are consistent with the view that of localized defect in immune surveillance may contribute to persistent fungal infection of the oral mucosa.",1992,1593492,no
A monoclonal antibody specific for conidia and mycelium wall layer of Penicillium and Aspergillus.,"A monoclonal antibody was obtained from BALB/c mice immunized with Penicillium frequentans mycelium. The specificity of the antibody was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent and indirect immunofluorescence assays against the same mycelium. This IgM antibody cross-reacted with various strains of the Penicillium and Aspergillus genera. By indirect immunofluorescence assays, the antibody was able to stain about 10% of Penicillium and Aspergillus conidia, but major part of conidia did not absorb the fluorescence-labeled antibody before swelling. During germination of P. frequentans conidia, the germ tube wall which constitutes a continuation of an inner wall layer was also stained. During germination of P. griseofulvum, the protrusion of the germ tube wall was not always recognized by the antibody because the germ tube wall was constituted by a continuation of an outer spore wall layer. The study of the staining patterns of the spores and the protrusions suggests that the antibody specifically recognizes an antigen of the inner spore wall layer. The monoclonal antibody reacts with extracellular galactomannans produced by genera Aspergillus and Penicillium but is not directed against beta-(1,5)-linked galactofuranose units.",1992,1584066,no
Acquired T cell specific deficiency other than acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).,"Evidence of an acquired T cell-specific deficiency distinct from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in a 63-yr-old Japanese female is provided. Recently, this patients suffered from primary invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Skin tests to purified protein derivative of tuberculin (PPD) and Aspergillus antigens were negative. Upon admission to our hospital, her lymphocytes were exclusively unresponsive to T cell mitogens (concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, and OKT 3). The level of cells defined by monoclonal antibodies (CD1, CD2, CD3, CD4, WT31, and CD5) was less than 3%. In contrast, no decrease in the number of red blood cells, platelets, neutrophils or B cells was apparent. Five years ago, the patient had a normal white blood cell and lymphocyte count. However, over the following 4 yr, she developed lymphopenia. With medication, her pulmonary disease recovered, while lymphopenia still continued. The levels of immunoglobulins, complements and enzyme activities (adenosine deaminase and purine nucleoside phosphorylase) were normal. Moreover, several tests for HIV (ELISA and Western bolt) were negative suggesting that the T cell-specific deficiency was not a congenital immunodeficiency or AIDS but rather a new type of acquired immunodeficiency.",1992,1568029,no
Precipitins and specific IgG antibody to Aspergillus fumigatus in a chest unit population.,"The enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting IgG antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus is more sensitive than the measurement of Aspergillus precipitins. The relation of the results from both techniques to the clinical pattern of disease in a large unselected group of patients from a large referral centre is unknown.The clinical relation of precipitins to Aspergillus fumigatus to clinical disease was determined retrospectively in 98 patients attending a primary referral centre. Precipitin results were compared with the specific IgG antibody to A fumigatus in 88 of the sera. Precipitins were determined by the agar gel double diffusion test and specific IgG antibody to A fumigatus by a quantitative ELISA.Precipitins were detected in the unconcentrated serum of 51 patients. Thirty nine of these had a mycetoma or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, 34 having specific IgG antibody to A fumigatus more than the control range. Forty seven patients had precipitins only after threefold concentration of serum or to only one of the four A fumigatus antigen extracts. Most of these had specific IgG in or near the control range. Thirty of these had A fumigatus skin test negative asthma or bronchiectasis, in which aspergillus was probably not pathogenic. There was a close relation between the level of antibody detected by the ELISA and the number of precipitin lines.This study reaffirmed the supportive role of aspergillus precipitins in the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis. No additional benefit in the routine use of the ELISA was seen. It also showed that care should be taken in interpreting positive precipitin results from concentrated serum and that using several rather than one A fumigatus antigen extract is helpful for identifying allergic aspergillosis.",1992,1539145,no
Increased prevalence of IgG-induced sensitization and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (humidifier lung) in nonsmokers exposed to aerosols of a contaminated air conditioner.,"Specific IgG antibodies against antigens of a contaminated air conditioner were estimated in serum of 134 workers of a printing company. Altogether 64% of the workers investigated revealed significantly elevated levels (> 3 U/ml) of IgG antibodies specific to these antigens as compared to a nonexposed control group. The occurrence of IgG antibodies for microbial extracts were 25% for Fusarium, 23% for Penicillium notatum, 13% for Alternaria tenuis, 12% for Aureobasidium pullulans, 9% for Sphaeropsidales species, 3% for Micropolyspora faeni, 2% for Aspergillus fumigatus and 2% for Thermoactionomyces vulgaris. Out of the 86 workers with elevated IgG antibodies for air conditioner antigens, 59 were nonsmokers. Considering a cut-off level of 10 U/ml IgG for high values, the proportion of smokers to nonsmokers becomes even more pronounced (6 to 36 respectively, binominal test p < 0.001). This is despite the fact that the distribution of smokers and nonsmokers among the 134 workers is approximately equal (60 to 74). All 3 workers with clinical diagnosis of humidifier lung or humidifier fever belonged to the nonsmoker group. Our findings indicate that crude water extracts of contaminated air conditioners are the best choice as antigen source for the diagnosis of humidifier lung in exposed workers. Nonsmokers are shown to have a high risk for immunological sensitization.",1992,1485005,no
Allergic bronchopulmonary fungal disease caused by Bipolaris and Curvularia.,Allergic bronchopulmonary fungal disease (ABPFD) usually manifests in asthmatics as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. In a few instances other fungi have been implicated. Serological testing in Western Australia between 1979 and 1986 revealed precipitins to Bipolaris and Curvularia species in 40 of 503 patients tested. Eight of these were patients with ABPFD due to Bipolaris and/or Curvularia and are reported here. Geographical location appeared to be significant as seven of eight of those with ABPFD (and at least 18 of 40 with positive serology) were living in the more remote and sub-tropical northern part of the state. ABPFD due to fungi other than Aspergillus species may be more common than previously recognised and further epidemiological assessment is warranted.,1991,1818547,no
"Sequence and expression of GLN3, a positive nitrogen regulatory gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encoding a protein with a putative zinc finger DNA-binding domain.","The GLN3 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required for the activation of transcription of a number of genes in response to the replacement of glutamine by glutamate as source of nitrogen. We cloned the GLN3 gene and constructed null alleles by gene disruption. GLN3 is not essential for growth, but increased copies of GLN3 lead to a drastic decrease in growth rate. The complete nucleotide sequence of the GLN3 gene was determined, revealing one open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 730 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 80,000. The GLN3 protein contains a single putative Cys2/Cys2 zinc finger which has homology to the Neurospora crassa NIT2 protein, the Aspergillus nidulans AREA protein, and the erythroid-specific transcription factor GATA-1. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that the GLN3 protein binds the nitrogen upstream activation sequence of GLN1, the gene encoding glutamine synthetase. Neither control of transcription nor control of initiation of translation of GLN3 is important for regulation in response to glutamine availability.",1991,1682800,no
Diagnosis of invasive candidiasis by detection of mannan antigen by using the avidin-biotin enzyme immunoassay.,"The diagnosis of invasive candidiasis was attempted by detection of circulating mannan antigen by using an avidin-biotin-amplified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (AB-ELISA), and this method was compared with the conventional culture method. Mannan antigen was detected by AB-ELISA in the sera of 16 (84.2%) of the 19 patients with invasive candidiasis. On the other hand, for 34 immunocompromised candidiasis-free patients, including 8 with aspergillosis or cryptococcosis, mannan antigen was positive during only 1 of the 67 febrile episodes and in the serum of none of the 50 outpatients without infections. The results were also negative for all patients with deep-seated mycoses other than candidiasis. However, the mannan level was low (less than 2.0 ng/ml) in the serum of 63.2% of the patients with invasive candidiasis. The positivity rate of blood cultures was 31.6%, and that of blood cultures and/or cultures of samples from sterile sites combined was 47.4%. The advantages of the diagnosis based on antigen detection by AB-ELISA are considered to be a higher sensitivity and elimination of nonspecific reactions by the introduction of the avidin-biotin system and pretreatment of sera by heating. In addition, it is considered essential for high sensitivity that transient mannan antigenemia be determined frequently so that it is not overlooked. In light of its sensitivity and specificity, this method is considered to be clinically useful in the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis.",1991,1774238,no
Antigen detection in invasive aspergillosis.,"The application of a reverse passive latex agglutination test and dot-blot assay are reported in the diagnosis of 50 proven cases of invasive aspergillosis and 28 suspected cases. At a latex titre cut off of greater than or equal to 1 in 8 the test had a sensitivity of 29.4%, specificity of 96.3% and efficiency of 41.4%. This was in sera taken when the diagnosis was first suggested. The sensitivity rose to 55.1% when sera with the maximum level of antigen were examined. The dot blot was more sensitive with 33.3% of cases being positive in the initial sera. This increased to 61.5% when the serum with the maximum antigen level was taken.",1991,1940388,no
Parallel activation of the NIMA and p34cdc2 cell cycle-regulated protein kinases is required to initiate mitosis in A. nidulans.,"We show that in Aspergillus nidulans, p34cdc2 tyrosine dephosphorylation accompanies activation of p34cdc2 as an H1 kinase at mitosis. However, the nimA5 mutation arrests cells in G2 with p34cdc2 tyrosine dephosphorylated and fully active as an H1 kinase. Activation of NIMA is therefore not required for p34cdc2 activation. Furthermore, mutation of nimT, which encodes a protein with 50% similarity to fission yeast cdc25, causes a G2 arrest and prevents tyrosine dephosphorylation of p34cdc2 but does not prevent full activation of the NIMA protein kinase. Mitotic activation of p34cdc2 by tyrosine dephosphorylation is therefore not required for activation of NIMA. These data suggest that activation of either the p34cdc2 protein kinase or the NIMA protein kinase alone is not sufficient to initiate mitosis. Parallel activation of both cell cycle-regulated protein kinases is required to trigger mitosis.",1991,1913824,no
Heat shock protein 88 and Aspergillus infection.,"Immunoblotting was used to dissect the antibody responses in the sera of 50 patients with proven invasive aspergillosis, 28 patients with suspected invasive aspergillosis, 35 patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and 10 patients with an aspergilloma. This demonstrated the immunodominance of antigenic bands at 88, 84, 51, and 40 kDa. Monoclonal antibodies against the heat shock protein 90 complexes of Candida albicans and the water mold Achlya ambisexualis identified these four antigenic bands as homologous proteins. Similar antigens have been described in humans, mice, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, chickens, and Drosophila species. The antibody against A. ambisexualis has previously been shown to cross-react with antigens belonging to the human heat shock protein 90 complex. Aspergillus heat shock protein 90 was extracted from the sera of patients with invasive aspergillosis by affinity chromatography. This was done with both a rabbit hyperimmune antiserum raised against an extract of Aspergillus fumigatus NCPF 2109 and a monoclonal antibody against the heat shock protein 90 of C. albicans. In vivo expression of the antigen was demonstrated in an aspergilloma surgically removed from a patient. The role of the antigen as an allergen in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is also discussed.",1991,1939562,no
[Allergenic relationships between Aspergillus restrictus and Aspergillus fumigatus determined by radioallergosorbent test inhibition].,"Recently Aspergillus restrictus, a species of osmophilic fungi, has been found to be widely distributed in our inhabited environment. The authors reported previously that the prevalence of hypersensitivity to this fungal species determined by skin prick test and radioallergosorbent test (RAST) was comparable with that to Aspergillus fumigatus. In this study, the allergenic relationships between the two fungi were examined by RAST and RAST inhibition tests in which A. restrictus extracts prepared from mycelial mats of two different strains cultured in M40Y liquid medium and A. fumigatus, one made from a mycelial mat cultured in YNB liquid medium containing 3% sucrose, were used. In the RAST inhibition tests using a serum pool obtained from five patients with highly positive RAST to these species, the two extracts of A. restrictus inhibited RAST to A. fumigatus by over 80%, and A. fumigatus extract inhibited RAST to the two strains of A. restrictus by approximately 75%. In A. fumigatus RAST inhibition tests using individual sera with positive A. fumigatus RAST, a strong inhibition (greater than 60%) elicited by each extract of A. restrictus was observed in 5 of 8 sera tested. In RAST, nine of 11 serum samples with positive RAST to A. fumigatus showed positive RAST to both strains of A. restrictus. There was a significant correlation between the RAST values of the two fungal species. These results give evidence of the presence of shared allergenic components between the two fungi, and indicate that these components may contain part of major allergens of A. fumigatus.",1991,1772354,no
Efficacy of SCH 39304 in treatment of experimental invasive aspergillosis.,"The efficacy of SCH 39304 (SCH) against Aspergillus fumigatus was assessed with an immunosuppressed, temporarily leukopenic rabbit model of invasive aspergillosis. Therapy with SCH at 10 or 15 mg/kg of body weight per day was begun 24 h after lethal challenge and compared with therapy with amphotericin B at 1.5 mg/kg/day. Compared with untreated controls, SCH reduced mortality and also reduced the tissue burden of A. fumigatus 100- to 1,000-fold in liver, kidney, and lung tissues. SCH at 15 mg/kg/day and amphotericin B eliminated A. fumigatus in liver, kidney, and lung tissues. In addition, both dosages of SCH significantly eliminated the organism from brain tissues, compared with controls. Both SCH and amphotericin B decreased or eliminated circulating aspergillus antigen. These results show that new azoles can be as effective as amphotericin B in eradicating the organism from tissues and offer promise in improving the treatment of invasive aspergillosis.",1991,1759818,no
Immunodiagnosis of aspergillosis.,"Aspergillus species are ubiquitous fungi and have been implicated as the causative agents of a variety of lung disorders in humans. These disorders include allergic, saprophytic, and systemic manifestations. The allergic disorders mainly affect atopic persons, and invasive or systemic diseases affect immunosuppressed individuals. Immunodiagnosis can help the practitioner diagnose these diseases. Demonstration of circulating antibodies is a useful criterion, but the lack of dependable and standardized antigens is a limiting factor in the diagnosis of most Aspergillus-induced diseases. Despite this limitation, however, immunodiffusion and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays have been widely used for the detection of antibodies in the sera of patients with aspergillosis. Similarly, crude and semipurified antigens are being used to demonstrate skin hypersensitivity in patients, and several methods have been useful in the detection of antigenemia in patients with invasive aspergillosis. With a growing number of reports on the incidence of aspergillosis and an increase in the number of immunosuppressed individuals in the population, more rapid methods and more reliable reagents for immunodiagnosis are needed. With recent attempts at obtaining reliable reagents for through hybridoma technology and molecular biological techniques, substantial progress toward efficient immunodiagnosis may be achieved.",1991,1747861,no
Identification and characterization of a second polygalacturonase gene of Aspergillus niger.,"The filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger produces several endopolygalacturonases that are involved in the degradation of pectin. PGI, the enzyme representing the second most abundant activity in a commercial enzyme preparation, was further characterized and the corresponding gene was isolated. The nucleotide sequence of the pgaI gene was determined and the protein coding region was found to be interrupted by two short introns, one of which has a unusual donor splice site. The deduced 368 amino acids long protein with a putative prepropeptide of 31 amino acids shows 60% sequence identity to PGII in the mature protein. PGI overproducing A. niger strains were obtained by cotransformation with the cloned gene.",1991,1934135,no
Structure of the Aspergillus niger pelA gene and its expression in Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus nidulans.,"Aspergillus niger pectin lyases are encoded by a multigene family. The complete nucleotide sequence of the pectin lyase PLA-encoding gene pelA has been determined. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with the deduced amino acid sequence of the other characterized pectin lyase, PLD, shows that the proteins share 69% amino acid identity. When grown on media with pectin as the sole carbon source, A. niger transformants containing multiple copies of the pelA gene show raised mRNA levels and overexpression of the gene product PLA compared with the wild-type strain. PLA was purified and characterized. In A. nidulans transformants PLA is also produced in medium containing a high concentration of glucose and no pectin.",1991,1934134,no
Variability in parameters of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in patients with cystic fibrosis.,"Seventy-nine patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) were evaluated and were followed in a longitudinal, prospective fashion during a 6-year period for the development of immune parameters indicating Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) sensitization and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). Although four patients developed frank ABPA, there was considerable variability in immune parameters in non-ABPA. Twenty-four patients became skin test positive to Af with none losing skin reactivity. Twenty-five patients developed serum precipitins to Af, whereas 12 patients lost their precipitins. Of 15 patients with an elevated total serum IgE of greater than or equal to 2 SD, five demonstrated a marked decline of at least 40%. Three of 16 patients with IgE-Af became negative, whereas eight of 27 patients lost their IgG-Af. None of these patients had received corticosteroid therapy that could have accounted for the findings. Thus, patients with CF frequently lose evidence of Af sensitivity spontaneously without corticosteroid intervention. The diagnosis of ABPA in CF should not be based solely on serology and skin test results, since at any point in time, patients with CF may demonstrate variable responses to Af.",1991,1890268,no
Immunohistochemical expression of galactomannan in the cytoplasm of phagocytic cells during invasive aspergillosis.,"The monoclonal antibody EB-A1 to galactomannan is apparently specific for detecting Aspergillus species and Penicillium marneffei in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues.

Use of patients' sera for immunoperoxidase demonstration of infectious agents in paraffin sections.,"Using patients' sera diluted from 1:10 to 1:1,000 as the primary antibodies in indirect immunoperoxidase staining, the authors visualized a variety of infectious agents in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. The target lesions included 1) pyoderma caused by Staphylococcus aureus, 2) cryptococcal infection, 3) dermal sporotrichosis, 4) colon ulcer caused by amebic dysentery, 5) cutaneous leishmaniasis, and 6) chronic liver abscess containing ova of Ascaris lumbricoides. The infectious agents were clearly identified in the respective lesions. Paraffin sections of other kinds of infectious lesions served as controls to clarify the specificity of the immunostaining. While the sera of patients with bacterial and fungal infection showed a wide range of cross-reactivity against bacteria and/or fungi, those with parasitic infection exhibited a relatively good specificity for the pathogen. Almost no immunoreactivity of endogenous human IgG in the paraffin sections was demonstrated under the conditions of this study. This approach can be used in diagnostic pathology, particularly when specific heteroantisera or monoclonal antibodies are unavailable.",1991,1776466,no
Resistance of C57Bl/6 mice to immunosuppressive effects of aflatoxin B1 and relationship with neuroendocrine mechanisms.,"Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) a secondary metabolite of Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus, is known for its carcinogenicity and immunosuppressive effects. We previously reported on the immunosuppressive effects of AFB1 in Swiss and CD-1 mice. This study concerned the involvement of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal gland axis in the immunosuppressive effects of AFB1 in C57Bl/6 mice. Animals were treated orally with 30, 150 or 750 micrograms/kg AFB1 daily for four weeks. Splenic lymphocytes were assayed to investigate their phenotyping using flow cytometry, proliferative response against mitogens and allogeneic lymphocytes, cytolytic cell activity, and IL-2 production. Antibody-mediated immunocompetence was checked using sheep red blood cell (SRBC)-challenged animals by plaque-forming cell assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The dose of AFB1 for the immunosuppressive effects on blastogenic response, IL-2 production, and primary antibody production of splenic cells was much higher than previous studies involving other mice strains. AFB1 decreased the amount of circulating anti-SRBC antibody, and the helper-T cell and B cell populations in phenotyping splenic lymphocytes. There were no significant changes in natural killer cell activity, mixed lymphocyte response, hypothalamic biogenic amine concentrations, and corticotropin releasing factor, and of adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone in plasma. Results were confirmed using adrenalectomized mice. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis does not appear to have a major role in AFB1-induced immunotoxicity.",1991,1761400,no
The 18-kilodalton antigen secreted by Aspergillus fumigatus.,One of the major antigens secreted in vitro by Aspergillus fumigatus is an 18-kDa basic protein which has been purified by cation-exchange chromatography. It is recognized by sera from aspergilloma patients. It is also the major circulating antigen found in urine of patients with invasive aspergillosis. Our results indicated that this antigen has potential for the diagnosis of both aspergilloma and invasive aspergillosis.,1991,1855978,no
[Diagnostic significance of serum IgE-Af and IgG-Af determined by ELISA in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis].,"IgE-Af and IgG-Af measured by the ELISA double-antibody technique in sera from 11 patients with ABPA were elevated to at least twice that in sera from asthma patients with positive skin tests to Af. This suggests that serum IgE-Af and IgG-Af measured by this technique have a practical value for the early diagnosis and follow-up of ABPA, as well as for differentiating patients with ABPA from asthma patients with positive skin tests to Af.",1991,1839517,no
Immunoblot analyses of the serologic response to Aspergillus fumigatus antigens in experimental invasive aspergillosis.,"The antibody response to Aspergillus fumigatus proteins was studied by the immunoblot technique in a rabbit model of invasive aspergillosis. Components of an A. fumigatus mycelial homogenate homogenate unbound by concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B chromatography were fractionated using SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose papers. The protein fraction was probed with serial sera obtained from immunosuppressed or nonimmunosuppressed rabbits inoculated intravenously with saline or graded inocula of A. fumigatus conidia. Seroconversion against antigens of 41, 54, and 71 kDa was demonstrated in 7 (50%), 3 (21%), and 3 (21%) of 14 infected animals that survived greater than or equal to 10 days. Antibodies against the three antigens were detected in 4 (12.5%), 19 (59%), and 14 (44%) of 32 rabbits before immunosuppression or infection. Two-dimensional immunoblotting revealed that the 41-, 54-, and 71-kDa antigens were derived in denaturing conditions from a single component resolved in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.",1991,2037796,no

Early recovery of lymphocyte response to Candida after bone marrow transplantation in colonized patients.,"Blood lymphocyte responses to Candida protein antigen (CP, Candida mannan mitogen (CM) and Staphylococcus aureus protein A (SPA) were followed in 133 bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. Lymphocyte proliferative responses to CP and SPA normalized within 6-12 months. The response to CM was only decreased in non-colonized patients during the first 2 months post-BMT and had already returned to normal by 1 month in colonized patients. During the forthcoming years all three lymphocyte stimulatory tests responses reached donor levels. There was a tendency for low lymphocyte reactivity to CP, high reactivity to CM and equal reactivity for SPA among recipients of T cell-depleted marrows as compared to patients with conventional graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. After BMT, patients who were colonized with Candida recovered and increased their lymphocyte response to CP and CM within 1-3 months, while non-colonized patients required more than 6 months to regain normal stimulatory capacity. Patients who developed grades II-IV acute GVHD had significantly higher pretransplant lymphocyte responses to both CP (p = 0.02) and CM (p = 0.02) than patients with grades 0-I acute GVHD. There was also a trend for patients who later had a confirmed invasive Candida infection to have high responses to CP before BMT (p = 0.07). After BMT, stimulation by CM, CP and SPA was not affected by acute or chronic GVHD or cytomegalovirus. In conclusion, proliferative capacity to Candida is restored early after BMT and superficial fungal colonization seem to be of importance for this maturation.",1991,2070134,no
Efficient KEX2-like processing of a glucoamylase-interleukin-6 fusion protein by Aspergillus nidulans and secretion of mature interleukin-6.,"We have designed an expression vector for the secretion of human interleukin-6 (hIL-6) in which the mature protein is fused through a spacer peptide, containing a KEX-2 like protein processing signal, to the entire Aspergillus niger glucoamylase (glaA) gene. Transformation of Aspergillus nidulans with this vector results in fungal strains secreting equimolar amounts of the glucoamylase and IL-6 proteins. The KEX2-type processing signal, Lys-Arg, is recognized and cleaved efficiently by an enzyme present in A. nidulans resulting in the secretion of an authentic mature hIL-6 protein at levels of up to 5 mg/l.",1991,1367012,no
Structural features of the cell-wall polysaccharides of Asparagus officinalis seeds.,"The fine structure of a beta-)1----4)-linked glucomannan from Asparagus officinalis has been determined by n.m.r. analysis of the oligosaccharides obtained by acidic and enzymic hydrolyses. Cleavage of the glucomannan with beta-D-mannase from Aspergillus niger and purification by h.p.l.c. gave oligosaccharide fractions that contained Man (mannose), GlcMan (beta-glucopyranosylmannose), Man2, Glc2Man, and Glc3Man as the major components. Simulated digestion of a polymer composed of randomly distributed monomers with the same Glc:Man ratio as glucomannan from A. officinalis led to the same polysaccharides. The random distribution of the monomers of glucomannan from A. officinalis was corroborated by the diffraction diagram of the raw flour, which indicated that the ""in situ"" glucomannan was amorphous, whereas both cellulose and mannans are crystalline.",1991,1878881,no
Cytologic diagnosis of aspergillosis in cardiac transplantation.,"Fine-needle aspiration of the lung is now widely utilized to diagnose pulmonary neoplasms, but often serologic techniques or open-lung biopsy is relied on for the diagnosis of infectious pulmonary processes. We report a series of four patients in whom the fine-needle aspiration technique was used to make the rapid cytologic diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis. Culture confirmation was also obtained on the aspirated material. A discussion of the available techniques for the laboratory diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis is presented and the advantages of fine-needle aspiration cytology are stressed. Our favorable results support expanded use of fine-needle aspiration cytology in the evaluation of lung nodules appearing in immunosuppressed populations.",1991,1998483,no
Macrophage colony-stimulating factor in murine candidiasis: serum and tissue levels during infection and protective effect of exogenous administration.,"Serum and tissue concentrations of the macrophage-specific colony-stimulating factor (CSF-1) and the number of CSF-1-responsive cells in bone marrow were investigated in mice chronically infected with a low-virulence strain of the opportunistic zoopathogenic yeast Candida albicans. CSF-1 levels in serum, brain, kidney, liver, and lung were significantly increased shortly after infection and remained elevated during the 2 weeks preceding the onset of specific T cell-dependent immunity. The number of monocytic precursor cells was also increased in the bone marrow of infected mice. When macrophages from naive donors were exposed in vitro to purified murine CSF-1, their anticandidal activity in vitro appeared to be enhanced. CSF-1 was also administered in vivo to prospective recipients of a lethal C. albicans challenge. The results showed that the factor could effectively potentiate the animals' resistance to the yeast, as shown by increased survival times and reduced recovery of viable C. albicans from the organs of the CSF-1-treated mice. Therefore, the present data suggest that CSF-1 is likely to contribute to early resistance to fungal infection and could be successfully exploited in experimental models of antifungal immunotherapy.",1991,1997436,no
Efficiency of crude and purified fungal antigens in serodiagnosis to discriminate mycotic from other respiratory diseases.,"Mycotic immunodiagnosis was performed in 186 hospitalized patients with different respiratory diseases, mostly considered as tuberculosis and others with a doubtful diagnosis. Crude histoplasmin, coccidioidin, paracoccidioidin, blastomycin, candidin, aspergillin, and sporotrichin, as well as purified polysaccharide-protein complexes (PPC) of Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis, and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis were used as antigens. Immune tests used included skin test (ST), gel immunodiffusion (ID), counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE), complement fixation (CF), and ELISA. A possible association with candidosis was observed in 17% of patients with tuberculosis and diabetes one presumptive paracoccidioidomycosis, one confirmed aspergillosis, and six cases of active histoplasmosis were determined. Candidin ST showed 29% of positive reactions with an increased frequency in patients between 31 and 55 years of age. CF test showed the highest positivity percentages with crude antigens, specially for Candida antigen (26.3%) and histoplasmin (18.2%). Cross reactions were evident with crude antigens but decreased when PPC's were used in ELISA.",1991,1749392,no
Ultrastructural demonstration of specific IgG and IgE antibodies binding to Aspergillus fumigatus from patients with aspergillosis.,"Aspergillus-induced diseases usually demonstrate elevated circulating antibodies belonging to different isotypes. The antigens currently used to detect antibodies are crude culture filtrate and mycelial extracts of A. fumigatus (Af). Most Af-associated diseases result from the inhalation of the spores of the organisms present in the environment. However, it is not known whether specific circulating antibodies directed only against spore or mycelia of Af exist in the sera of patients with Af-induced diseases. With colloidal gold we have investigated thin sections of spores and hyphae of Af for their reactivity with Af-specific IgG and IgE antibodies. The results indicate that both spores and hyphae reacted identically with IgG and IgE antibodies from patients. None of the sera from normal control subjects reacted in this system, although low levels of antibodies were detected in the sera by ELISA. Sera from both patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis or aspergilloma reacted with cell envelope antigens, whereas sera from patients with invasive aspergillosis also bound to cell sap. This method therefore demonstrates localization of antigens binding to different isotypes in the sera from different clinical forms of aspergillosis and may be useful in purifying specific antigens for immunodiagnosis.",1991,1706370,no
Electrophoretic and immunological comparisons of developmentally regulated proteins in members of the sclerotiniaceae and other sclerotial fungi.,"The fungal stroma is a distinct developmental stage, a compact mass of hyphal cells enveloped by a melanized layer of rind cells which is produced from vegetative mycelium. Two types of stromata that are characteristic of members of the Sclerotiniaceae but are also produced in a wide range of other fungi, i.e., the determinate tuberlike sclerotium and the indeterminate platelike substratal stroma, were compared in these studies. Developmental proteins found in determinate sclerotial and indeterminate substratal stromata, but not in mycelia, were characterized and compared in 52 isolates of fungi, both ascomycetes (including 18 species in the Sclerotiniaceae and 5 species of Aspergillus) and the basidiomycete Sclerotium rolfsii. One-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of mycelial, stromatal initial, and stromatal extracts demonstrated that all members of the Sclerotiniaceae produced proteins unique to stromatal extracts within a molecular weight range of 31,000 to 39,500 which composed 13 to 58% of the total protein in stromata. Proteins unique to the sclerotial stage were also produced in Sclerotium rolfsii and the Aspergillus species but within a generally lower-molecular-weight range of 11,000 to 30,000. The proteins were then characterized by two-dimensional electrophoresis to determine the number and isoelectric point of polypeptides composing each protein. Polyclonal antibodies were raised to the major 36-kDa sclerotial protein of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Ssp). Immunoblots demonstrated that all sclerotial proteins from species in the Sclerotiniaceae cross-reacted with anti-Ssp antibodies, while no cross-reaction was observed with proteins from substratal stromatal species in the Sclerotiniaceae, sclerotial species of Aspergillus, or Sclerotium rolfsii. Results of discriminant analysis of the data from competitive inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were consistent with the results of immunoblotting. Three groupings, sclerotial species in the Sclerotiniaceae, substratal stromatal species in the family, and sclerotial species outside the family, were delimited on the basis of relative decreasing ability to compete for anti-Ssp antibody. These data demonstrate that stromatal proteins differ among different taxonomic groups of fungi and suggest that the Sclerotiniaceae may include two distinct lineages of genera.",1991,16348418,no
Use of the extended Phadebas RAST panel in the diagnosis of mould allergy in asthmatic children.,"The clinical significance of mould allergens in Phadebas RAST panel was investigated in 121 asthmatic children. They were selected from a total population of 1649 patients. The patients were distributed into four groups, based on the combination of positive or negative skin prick tests (SPT) together with symptoms suggestive or not of mould sensitivity. Mould-specific IgE antibodies were investigated using the original RAST panel (Alternaria, Aspergillus, Candida, Cladosporium, Mucor and Penicillium) and a set of 10 additional mould-allergen discs (Aureobasidium, Botrytis, Curvularia, Epicoccum, Fusarium, Helminthosporium, Phoma, Rhizopus, Stemphylium and Trichoderma). The set of additional RAST discs revealed patients with mould-reaginic antibodies not found with the original RAST panel. This occurred in four of 49 (8.2%) RAST positive (class greater than or equal to 2) patients. The allergens most frequently positive were Cladosporium (in 28% of the patients), Candida (28%) and Helminthosporium (26%). A remarkable degree of simultaneous reactivity to almost all moulds tested was observed. Patients with multiple (greater than or equal to 7) mould sensitization were effectively pinpointed using any duplicate combination of Aureobasidium, Botrytis, Candida, Cladosporium, Helminthosporium, Penicillium and Stemphylium.",1991,2039083,no
Purification of a 20 kD allergen from Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Sera from patients sensitized to Aspergillus fumigatus (A.f.) were screened for specific IgE using sodiumdodecylsulphate-gradient-polyacrylamidegelelectrophoresis (SDSgPAGE) followed by immunoblotting to nitrocellulose. Approximately 25 IgE-binding components were detected. The components of molecular weight 20, 31, 44, 50, 53, 77 and 90 kD were reacting with more than 50% of the patients. The 90, 77 and 20-kD components showed up as the strongest IgE-binding bands. The 20-kD component, called Ag 20 kD, was purified and further characterized. Ag 20 kD was purified to apparent homogeneity. using a combination of size-exclusion chromatography on a Sephacryl S-200 column, preparative isoelectric focusing in a pI 2.5-6.5 gradient, and a Sephadex G-50 Superfine column. Fractions were characterized with protein and carbohydrate analyses, RAST and SDSgPAGE followed by immunoblotting to nitrocellulose. Ag 20 kD was found to be a glycoprotein as it stained with both Coomassie Brilliant Blue and PAS. However, it did not bind Con A, and thus, did probably not contain any terminal alpha-D mannopyranosyl end groups. The relation between mannose, galactose and glucose was found to be 2:1:0.5. The isoelectric point was heterogeneous within pH range 5-6, and the molecular weight was estimated to approximately 20 kD. An increased RAST response was shown for the purified component compared with crude extract using patient sera reacting with Ag 20. The antigen was shown not to be identical with the previously described Ag 3. Neither did it fit the description of Ag 5, 7 or 13 earlier described by the same group. The antigen is going to be used for further immunochemical and clinical investigations, and coupling to other systems for antigen characterization.",1991,2039078,no
Clustering of fungal allergen-specific IgE antibody responses in allergic subjects.,"Statistical analysis of specific IgE immune responses to a panel of nine allergens from 2,094 patients demonstrated significant clustering between Aspergillus fumigatus, Alternaria alternata, and Cladosporium herbarum, not explained by crossreactive elements. This may represent a linked, high responder status to these fungal antigens in the allergic population.",1991,1994786,no
"The prevalence of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in patients with asthma, determined by serologic and radiologic criteria in patients at risk.","Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, a hitherto uncommon but potentially crippling complication of asthma, occurs at an unknown prevalence in the United States. Using both modern serologic criteria complete with a history of asthma and radiologic findings, we were able to make the diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in 28 of 100 consecutive patients with asthma who had immediate cutaneous reactivity to Aspergillus fumigatus and who were seen in an outpatient setting. Problems associated with use of less comprehensive criteria for this diagnosis are discussed.",1991,1993855,no
Methodological considerations when using nitrocellulose immunoblotting from polyacrylamide gels to study the mould allergens Aspergillus fumigatus and Alternaria alternata.,"The effects of sample treatments, separation conditions, and the possible presence of antibody interference phenomena in sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE) followed by nitrocellulose immunoblotting (IB) were studied using allergens from Alternaria alternata (Alt.a.) and Aspergillus fumigatus (Asp.f.) as model systems. In order to obtain good resolution in the IB method the mould allergens were separated in gradient gels under dissociating conditions (SDSgPAGE) including sample treatment with boiling, SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol (ME). These treatments all reduced the IgE binding capacities of the Asp.f. and Alt.a. extracts studied. Nevertheless, a great variety of IgE-binding components were detected after IB, and this could probably be explained by refolding of allergens during the blotting procedure where SDS was partly removed. A comparison of IgG-enriched and IgG-reduced serum fractions in IB revealed small differences in the IgE-binding patterns suggesting that IgG interference is of minor importance in the system studied. The IB method must be individually optimized for each new allergen studied using well characterized sera, preferably monospecific for the major components. Taking these facts into consideration, the IB technique is a valuable complement to other methods in the study of mould allergens.",1991,1995716,no
Purification and characterization of two endopolygalacturonases from Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.,"The endopolygalacturonase (EC 3.2.1.15) enzyme produced in vitro by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum were found to consist of numerous isoforms covering a broad pI range. Two of the isoforms, labelled PG2 and PG3, were purified using gel-filtration chromatography, isoelectric focusing and anion-exchange chromatography. The pIs of PG2 and PG3 were, respectively, 4.8 and 4.9. Their molecular weights were similar. Both enzymes hydrolysed 0.9% of the bonds in reaching a 50% reduction in viscosity. However, their enzymic parameters were different. Their amino acid compositions differed only in the aspartic acid-asparagine content. The N-terminal sequences differed at the fourth amino acid only. PG2 and PG3 exhibited a high level of glycosylation compared to a similar enzyme isolated from Aspergillus niger. Antibody raised against PG3 was shown to crossreact with PG2, but not with the enzyme purified from Aspergillus niger.",1991,1991145,no
Allergenic components of Aspergillus fumigatus determined by radioimmunoprecipitation.,"The allergenic components of Aspergillus fumigatus were identified using radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. Sera from 20 asthmatic children with positive skin tests to A. fumigatus were used for assay. Immune complexes formed between iodinated A. fumigatus and IgE antibodies in patients' sera were precipitated by immobilized anti-IgE monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). The precipitates were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and analyzed by autoradiography. It was found that IgE antibodies in the sera of allergic individuals reacted with several allergenic components of A. fumigatus ranging from 10 to 125 kD. Proteins of 38, 33, and 68 kD were recognized by IgEs from the allergic sera with frequencies of 85%, 65%, and 40%, respectively. It appears that these are the major allergenic components of A. fumigatus.",1991,2071555,no
Production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies to a 58-kilodalton antigen of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Eight monoclonal antibodies that recognize a serodiagnostically important 58-kDa antigen of Aspergillus fumigatus were produced and partially characterized. 2-7, 2-12, and 2-14 are of the immunoglobulin M class, and 2-2-1, 2-2-4, 2-2-6, 2-2-9, and 2-2-13 are all immunoglobulin G1(kappa) antibodies. Immunoblot analysis with A. fumigatus mycelial extract demonstrated that all of the monoclonal antibodies recognize a major 58-kDa antigen. The antigen was also detected by immunoblot analysis of 4- and 7-day culture filtrate preparations. 2-2-1, 2-2-4, and 2-2-6 cross-reacted with an antigen of approximately 55 kDa from an extract of Candida albicans. 2-7, 2-12, 2-14, and 2-2-4 formed a precipitin band with immunoaffinity-purified 58-kDa antigen by immunodiffusion. Results from indirect immunofluorescence assays with 2-7 and 2-2-9 showed fluorescent staining mainly on the surfaces of conidia and hyphae, indicating that the 58-kDa antigen may be cell wall associated. 2-2-9 and 2-2-13 and antibodies in patient and immune rabbit sera precipitated the [35S]methionine-labeled 58-kDa antigen. The 58-kDa antigen immunoprecipitated by each of the antibodies was enzymatically cleaved by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease one cleavage product, a 35-kDa fragment, was generated, indicating that the precipitated antigens share primary structure. Immunoblot analysis with an immunoaffinity-purified 58-kDa antigen showed that sera from patients with invasive aspergillosis reacted with the same antigen as that recognized by the monoclonal antibodies.",1991,1987045,no
Identification and characterization of an immunodominant 58-kilodalton antigen of Aspergillus fumigatus recognized by sera of patients with invasive aspergillosis.,"Sera from 38 patients with invasive aspergillosis were tested by Western immunoblotting for the presence of antibodies to antigens of Aspergillus fumigatus present in a mycelial extract of the organism. All of the sera contained antibodies to an antigen of molecular weight 58,000, which was which was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It was the only antigen recognized in approximately 90% of the sera tested. The 58-kDa antigen is an abundant component of mycelial extracts composing approximately 50% of the Coomassie blue-stained protein. The antigen also contains carbohydrate, since it is stained by the carbohydrate stain periodic acid-Schiff and it binds to the lectin concanavalin A. It was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography employing a monoclonal antibody directed against an epitope on the 58-kDa antigen. Analysis of the purified antigen by gas-liquid chromatography revealed the presence of mannose, galactose, and glucose residues in a 2:1:2 ratio. The ratio of protein to carbohydrate is 1.16:1. The protein is slightly acidic, containing relatively high quantities of glutamic and aspartic acids, glycine, alanine, serine, and threonine. The 58-kDa antigen also contains phosphate groups as part of its structure. Serological activity was totally destroyed after treatment with sodium metaperiodate and was partially destroyed after treatment with pronase. The 58-kDa antigen was not able to hydrolyze protein.",1991,1987044,no
Primary diagnosis of disseminated fungal disease by fine-needle aspiration of soft-tissue lesions.,"Two cases of disseminated fungal infections diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration of soft-tissue masses are presented. Both patients were initially treated on an outpatient basis for a presumed musculoskeletal disorder before the diagnostic biopsy was obtained. The first patient apparently contracted Coccidioides immitis infection while residing in Arizona, but the diagnosis was rendered on an aspirate of a buttock mass performed in Boston. The second patient, a non-insulin-dependent diabetic, was diagnosed with a cryptococcal abscess on an aspirate of a shoulder mass performed in the emergency room. The diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis was confirmed by culture and that of Cryptococcus by serology. Fungal infection was clinically unsuspected in both patients and the cytologic diagnosis facilitated rapid implementation of therapy.",1991,1954837,no
[Immunologic response to microorganisms from a polluted ventilation system in a working environment].,"Authors point out the morbidity of employees working in ventilation systems contaminated with various microorganisms. They analysed 96 workers exposed to air conditioning system (Group A), and 71 workers (Group B) breathing normal ambient air. The workers of both groups were subjected clinically by functionally and immunologically. Preparation of antigens ""MMM"" (Monday morning miseries) was used as an original method by Ajello et al. for producing antigens from systemic mycotic agents and subsequently modified. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the possibility of using ELISA in clinical practice for respiratory allergy diagnosis, and especially Hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Atopic status was determined by skin prick tests with common airborne allergens including Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, ragweed, grasses and Aspergillus fumigatus., by Enzygnost--IgE (Behringwerke AG, Marburg) and for specific IgE by RAST technique (Pharmacia, Uppsala). The skin prick tests were performed with ""MMM""-antigens. PEFR (Peak Expiratory Flow-Rate) was measured by using a Wright's peak flow meter. PEFR was recorded on Monday (first day at work) and Friday (the end of the working week). Measured values of PEFR in both groups of employees from Monday to Friday were elaborated by the Wilcoxon test.Culture of scrapings from air conditioning vents were obtained and water from the humidifier system also cultured. They were grown: T. vulgaris, Aspergillus fumigatus, Thermoactinomyces vulgaris and others. Results of questionnaires, clinical evaluation and diagnostical procedures in employees of Group A and B are as follows: Thirty eight workers in Group A had a positive clinical history of ""Monday illness"". In the symptomatic Group A we found in 8 cases abnormal chest roentgenogram. Further, there was no correlation between the presence of antibodies (ELISA) against MMM and pulmonary function abnormalities, as measured by either spirometry or DLCO. Further, we found good agreement between ELISA and prick test results with antigen MMM. Wilcoxon test showed a statistically significant difference between the two groups (0.01). The median or central value of PEFR reduction in Group A is 10.23 per cent, and in Group B 1.49 per cent. A 30 per cent reduction of PEFR was observed in 5.21 per cent of subjects in Group A. Exposure to ventilation systems contaminated with Thermophilic actinomyces may be responsible for increased morbidity and reduced performance of employees working in air conditioning systems. Particularly the main filter should be checked regularly. Moreover, regular microbiologic examinations of dust and water from air preventing chronic obstructive lung diseases in employees working in areas served by contaminated air conditioning systems.",1991,1916435,no
Immunoassay of ochratoxin and other mycotoxins from a single extract of cereal grains utilizing monoclonal antibodies.,"Immunoassays provide rapid, specific, sensitive and inexpensive methods for analysing mycotoxins but have generally been tested individually. Mycotoxigenic fungi rarely occur in pure culture in nature, and different mycotoxins may occur together. It would therefore be advantageous if several immunoassays for different mycotoxins could utilize a single extract. Monoclonal antibodies specific for ochratoxin A, aflatoxin B1 and T-2 toxin, raised at the University of Strathclyde, allow detection limits of 1 ng/ml ochratoxin A, 0.1 ng/ml aflatoxin B1 and 10 ng/ml T-2 toxin, when used in competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. These antibodies have been used to assay ochratoxin A. aflatoxin B1 and T-2 toxin in a single acetonitrile: 0.5% KCl:6% H2SO4 (89:10:1) extract of cereal grain. Extracts were either diluted 1:10 for direct assay or subjected, before assay, to a simple liquid-liquid clean-up procedure, which removed interfering substances and resulted in a 5:1 concentration. Recoveries from barley to which mycotoxins had been added averaged 95.8% for ochratoxin A, 93.8% for aflatoxin B1 and 80.6% for T-2 toxin, and the detection limits were 5 ng/g for ochratoxin A, 4 ng/g for aflatoxin B1 and 50 ng/g for T-2 toxin. Mean coefficients of variation within and between assays and between subsamples were less than 12% for ochratoxin A and aflatoxin B1 but up to 17% for T-2 toxin in assays of barley inoculated with toxigenic fungi.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1991,1820360,no
"Use of monoclonal antibodies, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoaffinity column chromatography to determine ochratoxin A in porcine sera, coffee products and toxin-producing fungi.","Ochratoxin A, produced by a number of fungal species, has been found in many milieu, including porcine sera and coffee beans. It was therefore analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in porcine sera, coffee products and fungal cultures, using monoclonal antibodies, a monoclonal antibody-linked immunoaffinity column (IAC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The chloroform extracts of acidified porcine sera were assayed directly by ELISA, with alkaline phosphatase and horseradish peroxidase as marker enzymes, at detection limits of 0.1 and 0.01 ng/ml, respectively. The presence of ochratoxin A in ELISA was confirmed by HPLC. The average contents in the five different lots tested were: 0.4 ng/ml in lot A (19 samples), 0.36 ng/ml in lot B (104 samples), 5.20 ng/ml in lot C (17 samples), 1.24 ng/ml in lot D (23 samples) and 0.22 ng/ml in lot E (24 samples). ELISA of methanol extracts of rice cultures showed the presence of more than 0.1 ng/g in 3 of 15 isolates of Aspergillus, in 16 of 67 isolates of Penicillum and in 7 of 17 isolates of Eupenicillum none was found in an isolate of Emericella. IAC-HPLC analysis revealed that P. foetidus, which is similar to A. niger and is used for the production of a Japanese alcoholic drink (shou-chuu), also produced ochratoxin A. Use of IAC-HPLC to analyse coffee beans and instant coffee power resulted in the sharp resolution of ochratoxin A without complicated clean-up steps. The IAP-HPLC technique could thus be used for mass surveys of ochratoxin A residues in biological specimens.",1991,1820356,no
"Induction, purification and characterisation of arabinases produced by Aspergillus niger.","The induction of arabinases in Aspergillus niger N400 was studied on different simple and complex carbon sources. Sugar beet pulp was found to be an inducer of three arabinan degrading enzymes (alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase A, alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase B and endoarabinase). These enzymes were purified from A. niger culture fluid after growth of the fungus in medium employing sugar beet pulp as the carbon source and were characterised both physico-chemically (Mw 83,000, 67,000, 43,000 Da and, pI 3.3, 3.5 and 3.0 for alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases A and B and endo-arabinase, respectively) and kinetically (Km on p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside 0.68 and 0.52 mM for alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases A and B, resp. Km on sugar beet arabinan 0.24 and 3.7 g/l for alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase B and endoarabinase, resp.). The amino acid compositions of the three enzymes were determined also. The enzymic properties were compared with those of arabinases purified from a commercial A. niger enzyme preparation. Differences were found though the kinetic data suggest considerable similarity between the enzymes from the different sources. Antibodies raised in mice against the three enzymes were found to be highly specific and no crossreactivity with other proteins present in culture filtrates was observed. A mixture of these antibodies has been used to analyze specific induction of these individual enzymes on simple and complex substrates by Western blotting.",1991,1814275,no
"Bovine milk, including pasteurised milk, contains antibodies directed against allergens of clinical importance to man.","Pasteurised and raw bovine milk and bovine colostrum samples were assayed by enzyme-linked immunoassay for the presence of antibodies directed against a selection of allergens of importance in human atopic disease. Samples were tested for the presence of antibodies directed against or cross-reacting with ryegrass pollen, house dust mites, Aspergillus mould and wheat proteins. Antibodies of each specificity were detected in every sample tested, including all samples of commercial pasteurised milk. The results are discussed with reference to a hypothesis that dietary xenogeneic antibodies may play a role in the emergence of some human atopic disease, and the recent demonstration that oral immunisation with xenogeneic antibodies may lead to the production of anti-immunoglobulin antibodies including anti-idiotypic antibodies.",1991,1809694,no
Immunological agglutination kinetics of latex particles with physically adsorbed antigens.,"The influence of the properties of antigens and particles on the immunological agglutination kinetics of the antigen-coated latex particles was studied. Horse cytochrome c, hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL), bovine serum albumin (BSA), and Aspergillus sp. glucose oxidase were physically adsorbed onto the surfactant free latices of styrene-methacrylic acid (MAA) copolymer (P (S/MAA)) and polystyrene (PS). The initial rates of the immunological agglutination of these protein-coated particles initiated by the addition of antibodies were quantified by the absorbance change at a wavelength of 680 nm. The initial agglutination rates of the particles covered with smaller antigens were lower. This effect of the molecular size of antigens was larger in P(S/MAA), because small antigens are probably buried in the hydrous polymethacrylic acid layer on the surface of particles. Thus, both the molecular size of antigens and the surface properties of particles affect the sensitivity of the immunological agglutination. On the other hand, the dependence of the initial rate of the immunological agglutination on the ionic strength and pH was similar irrespective of antigen-particle systems. The initial agglutination rates were largest at an ionic strength of approximately 0.05 at pH 7.0 and decreased with increasing pH. This dependence of the sensitivity on the pH and ionic strength is attributed to the electrostatic interactions of particle-particle and antibody-particle.",1990,2177074,no
Purification and characterisation of an extracellular serine proteinase from Aspergillus fumigatus and its detection in tissue.,"A serine proteinase (Alp) from the culture supernate of a clinical isolate of Aspergillus fumigatus was purified to virtual homogeneity at a yield of 41%. The procedure involved affinity chromatography on agarose-epsilon-amino-caproyl-D-tryptophan methyl ester. Alp had an estimated mol. wt of 32 Kda and the pI was determined at pH 7.9. The enzyme was fully inhibited by phenylmethyl sulphonyl fluoride, chymostatin and alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor, and it was largely inhibited by alpha-1-anti-chymotrypsin. Partial inhibition was observed with tosyl-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, but tosyl-lysine chloromethyl ketone was ineffective. Thus, Alp may be identical with the major chymotryptic activity of A. fumigatus, which has already been described. The N-terminal sequence of 25 amino acids revealed an 88% homology of Alp with the subtilisin-related proteinase of A. oryzae. Alp acted on casein over a broad range from pH 5.5 to 11.5 and also acts to a lesser extent on haemoglobin and serum albumin. The enzyme degraded elastin and a synthetic elastase substrate hence, it may be identical with the previously described elastinolytic activity of the fungus. At pH 7.3 and a concentration of 1 microgram/ml, Alp was not toxic for Vero cells, but it efficiently detached such cells from a plastic surface. Specific antibodies against Alp were detected by enzyme immunoassay in the sera of patients and Alp-antigen was demonstrated by immunofluorescence in mycotic human lung. In addition, a second proteinase (Exalp) with extremely alkaline activity, and an aspartic proteinase of A. fumigatus are described.",1990,2258912,no

Regulation of the glaA gene of Aspergillus niger.,"The glucoamylase gene of Aspergillus niger, glaA, is expressed at high levels in the presence of starch. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of 1966 bp of the 5' flanking region of the glaA gene and have begun to identify sequences important for the control of glaA expression by deletion analysis. Constructs containing deletions extending into the glaA gene promoter were introduced into an A. niger host whose own glaA gene had been disrupted by a gene replacement event. Secreted levels of glucoamylase, expressed from each of the recombinant glaA genes, were measured by enzyme immunoassay. The effect of each deletion on the expression of glaA, when grown on differing carbon sources, was used to determine the limits of sequences upstream of glaA responsible for gene regulation. A region between -562 and -318 appears to direct high-level expression, whereas only 214 bp of 5' flanking sequence is required to initiate the start to transcription.",1990,2076554,no
"Expression of the Aspergillus niger glucose oxidase gene in A. niger, A. nidulans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.","We report the cloning of the Aspergillus niger glucose oxidase gene and its use to elevate glucose oxidase productivity in A. niger by increasing the gene dosage. In addition, the gene has been introduced into A. nidulans where it provides the novel capacity to produce glucose oxidase. A plasmid, in which DNA encoding the mature form of glucose oxidase was preceded by a Saccharomyces cerevisiae secretion signal, effected high-level production of extracellular glucose oxidase in this yeast.",1990,2076553,no
Value of antigen detection in predicting invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.,"Two ELISAs were used to detect serum and urinary aspergillus antigen in 121 patients who were profoundly neutropenic after leukaemia therapy or bone marrow transplantation. The presence of antigen correctly predicted development of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in 16 patients. In 2 other cases antigen appeared after the clinical diagnosis had been made, while in only 1 case was antigen not detected. In 11 of 13 episodes of clinically suspected fungal infection antigen was detected before clinical diagnosis was made. By contrast, antigen was detected in only 1 of 90 patients who had no evidence of IPA. Both ELISAs gave positive and negative predictive values for IPA of greater than 95%, demonstrating the value of antigen detection in early diagnosis of aspergillus infection and the assay's ability to predict subsequent development of IPA. We conclude that neutropenic patients should be screened for aspergillus antigen, and propose that initial detection of fungal antigen justifies commencement of empirical antifungal therapy. Such an approach should improve the survival of patients who are at risk of developing this usually fatal infection.",1990,1978070,no
[Allergenicity of the osmophilic fungus Aspergillus restrictus evaluated by skin prick test and radioallergosorbent test].,"Recently large amounts of Aspergillus restrictus, a species of osmophilic fungi, have been detected in house dust using culture media with low water activity. But little attention has been paid to this fungus as an allergen. In the present study, the authors examined the allergenic activity of A. restrictus by skin prick tests and radioallergosorbent tests (RAST) on 94 asthmatic patients (mean age 12.0, range 3-18). Aspergillus fumigatus, Alternaria alternata and house dust were used for comparison. In the skin prick tests, A. restrictus, A. fumigatus, A. alternata and house dust elicited positive reactions in 8 (8.5%), 8 (8.5%), 15 (16.0%) and 69 (73.4%) patients, respectively. RAST showed positive reactions in 27 (28.7%) subjects for A. restrictus, 22 (23.4%) for A. fumigatus, 35 (37.2%) for A. alternata, and 75 (79.8%) for house dust. These results indicated that some asthmatic individuals showed immediate-type hypersensitivity to A. restrictus, and the prevalence of hypersensitivity of A. restrictus determined by skin prick tests and RAST was comparable with that of A. fumigatus but lower than that of A. alternata or house dust. This indicates that this fungal species may be of importance as a causative agent in atopic diseases.",1990,2288495,no
"Aspergillus fumigatus allergen I, a major IgE-binding protein, is a member of the mitogillin family of cytotoxins.","A major 18-kD IgE-binding protein from Aspergillus fumigatus (Asp fI) has been purified. Partial amino acid sequencing of Asp f I showed extensive sequence homology (95%) between Asp fI and a cytotoxin (mitogillin) produced by A. restrictus. Crossinhibition radioimmunoassay using murine monoclonal antibody and human IgG and IgE antibodies showed that Asp fI and mitogillin were antigenically indistinguishable. Furthermore, both proteins inhibited protein synthesis in vitro by greater than 90%. Asp fI was expressed in A. fumigatus but not in seven other Aspergillus species. The results suggest that Asp fI could play a dual role in the pathogenesis of A. fumigatus-related diseases by promoting colonization through cytotoxic activity and by causing inflammatory reactions involving IgE antibodies.",1990,2230656,no
Serum immunoglobulins E and G anti-Aspergillus fumigatus antibody in patients with cystic fibrosis who have allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"Patients with cystic fibrosis frequently have pulmonary colonization with Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) and develop anti-Af immunoglobulin E (IgE) and IgG antibodies. The diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in subjects with cystic fibrosis is difficult because of the high incidence of Af colonization, with development of humoral antibody responses. In this study, we sequentially measured serum anti-Af IgE (Af-E) and IgG (Af-G) antibodies by ELISA in subjects with cystic fibrosis. In subjects with cystic fibrosis who have allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, Af-E and Af-G antibodies were significantly increased when compared with other groups of patients with cystic fibrosis who had positive skin tests or precipitins to Af (or both) (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.01, respectively). In addition, increased Af-E and Af-G levels were sometimes seen in other groups, especially subjects with cystic fibrosis who had positive Af skin tests or precipitin tests, two of whom later developed criteria diagnostic of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Thus, serum Af-E and Af-G levels were quantitatively increased in subjects with cystic fibrosis who had allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and thus adjunctive data in diagnosis. However, it also suggested that subclinical pulmonary inflammation may also occur.",1990,2230542,no
Heterologous gene expression by filamentous fungi: secretion of human interleukin-6 by Aspergillus nidulans.,"Expression vectors for human interleukin-6 (hIL6) contain an expression cassette consisting of the Aspergillus niger glaA promoter and the Aspergillus nidulans argB terminator. The secretion signals were either those of glaA or that of the authentic hIL6 peptide. The constructs under study were introduced into A. nidulans and A. niger by means of cotransformation. No IL6 activity could be detected in the medium of a cotransformed A. niger strain, although transcripts corresponding with the IL6 cDNA were present. Evidence is presented that this apparent lack of IL6 expression is due to extracellular proteolytic activity. In the media of a cotransformed A. nidulans strain grown on starch, IL6 activity was detected by means of a bioassay. Up to 25 ng/ml of biologically active hIL6 could be secreted by A. nidulans transformed with the plasmid containing the mature hIL6-encoding gene fused to the glaA signal peptide nucleotide sequences. hIL6 of the expected 23-kDa size was also observed by Western-blot analysis of the medium. There was no evidence for glycosylation of the protein.",1990,2258049,no
Immunoblot analysis of sera from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis: correlation with disease activity.,"Immunoblot analysis was used to evaluate the IgG, IgE, and IgA responses to Aspergillus fumigatus antigen with the sera of five patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) before, during, and after suspected exacerbation of their disease. The results revealed a heterogenous antibody response, unique for each patient, to specific Aspergillus fumigatus antigens that correlated with the molecular weights of previously well-characterized antigens of importance in the immunopathogenesis of ABPA. A rating scale was devised for measuring band intensity that allowed the patient's antibody responses to be reproducibly semiquantitated. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated qualitative and semiquantitative information that is not available with other in vitro assays used in the study of patients with ABPA, such as ELISA. These initial results emphasize the need for additional evaluation of this technique to assess its potential clinical application in this disease.",1990,2229814,no
Cross-reactivity among antigens of different air-borne fungi detected by ELISA using five monoclonal antibodies against Penicillium notatum.,"Cross-reactivity among antigens of 12 genera of air-borne fungi, 13 species of Penicillium, and 5 species of Aspergillus was studied by ELISA using five monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against Penicillium notatum. Epitopes recognized by all the five MoAbs were susceptible to treatment of mild periodate oxidation and may therefore be associated with carbohydrates. Furthermore, our results showed that there is cross-reactivity among antigens of Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Eurotium species. By using these MoAbs, cross reactivity was not detected between antigens of Penicillium notatum and antigens of Fusarium solani, Alternaria porri, Cladosporium cladosporoides, Curvularia species, Nigrospora species, Aureobasidium pullulans, Wallemia species, Rhizopus arrhizus, and Candida albicans. Cross-reactivity among antigens of 11 species of Penicillium and 5 species of Aspergillus could be detected by ELISA using one of the five MoAbs (MoAb P15). The fact that there may be cross-reactivity among antigens of closely related fungi species should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of mold allergic diseases.",1990,2178052,no
Immunoprecipitation distinguishes non-overlapping groups of snRNPs in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.,"The large number of snRNAs in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe can be divided into four non-overlapping groups by immunoprecipitation with antibodies directed against mammalian snRNP proteins. 1) Of the abundant snRNAs, anti-Sm sera precipitate only the spliceosomal snRNAs U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6. Surprisingly, three Sm-sera tested distinguish between U2, U4 and U5 and U1 from S.pombe one precipitating only U1 and two precipitating U2, U4 and U5 but not U1. 2) A group of 11 moderately abundant snRNAs are not detectably precipitated by human anti-Sm sera, but are specifically precipitated by monoclonal antibody H57 specific for the human B/B' polypeptides. From Aspergillus nidulans this antibody also precipitates at least 12 snRNAs. 3) Anti-(U3)RNP sera do not precipitate the above snRNAs, but precipitate at least 6 further snRNAs, including the homologues of U3. Both the anti-(U3)RNP sera and H57 also efficiently precipitate a number of discrete non-capped RNAs. 4) A small number of additional snRNAs are not detectably precipitated by any anti-serum tested to date, further analysis may identify antisera specific for these snRNPs. Western blots of purified snRNP proteins were used to identify the S.pombe proteins responsible for these immunoprecipitations. Several Sm-sera decorate a 16.3kD protein which may be a D protein homologue, monoclonal H57 decorates a further protein of 16kD and an anti-(U3)RNP serum decorates the homologue of the 36kD U3-specific protein, fibrillarin.",1990,2144896,no
Evaluation of Basidiomycete and Deuteromycete (Fungi Imperfecti) extracts for shared allergenic determinants.,"Aqueous extracts of select members of the Basidiomycetes and Deuteromycetes (Fungi Imperfecti) were evaluated for the presence of shared allergenic determinants using skin prick and radio-allergosorbent test (RAST) inhibition. Twenty adults with perennial symptoms of rhinitis, with or without asthma, were skin-prick tested with six species of Deuteromycetes and seven species of Basidomycetes. Positive weal-and-flare reactivity to Pleurotus ostreatus was associated with Alternaria alternata, Fusarium solani and Epicoccum purpurescens. Positive skin reactivity to Calvatia cyathiformis was also associated with A. alternata and F. solani. Coprinus quadrifidus was associated only with F. solani, and Psilocybe cubensis was only associated with Aspergillus fumigatus. No other skin test associations were demonstrated. For every allergen tested by RAST inhibition, significant dose-dependent homologous inhibition was demonstrated. Although the ability of an individual heterologous extract to inhibit the direct RAST varied, inhibition was generally minimal. In the most extreme example, no heterologous allergen inhibited the A. alternata RAST. However, the Armillaria tabescens RAST was inhibited 52.6%, 38.1% and 25.1% by A. fumigatus, E. purpurescens, and Penicillium notatum, respectively, suggesting significant cross-reactivity. These results suggest that, although shared allergenic determinants exist between select species of Basidiomycetes and Deuteromycetes, crossreactivity is minimal and its clinical significance is not clear. These data confirm that for reliable diagnosis of fungal allergy, representatives of both major groups must be used.",1990,2253084,no
Isolation and molecular characterisation of the benzoate-para-hydroxylase gene (bphA) of Aspergillus niger: a member of a new gene family of the cytochrome P450 superfamily.,"The gene coding for benzoate-para-hydroxylase (bphA) of Aspergillus niger was cloned using differential hybridisation techniques and complementation of mutants deficient in this enzyme activity. The nucleotide sequence of the gene was determined, the presence of two introns was shown and the transcription start and termination sites were determined. The structure of the mRNA upstream from the long open reading frame (ORF) is unusual. It contains two small, overlapping ORFs whose function is unknown. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the protein with the sequences present in the databanks, indicated a significant similarity of BPH to the superfamily of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Further analysis revealed that this protein is a member of a new P450 gene family designated P450LIII. The gene is designated CYP53. To increase the BPH activity of A. niger, multiple copies of the bphA gene were introduced into the genome of a recipient strain by transformation. Although increased intracellular levels of the BPH protein could be detected, the BPH enzyme activity was decreased, suggesting titration of another essential component.",1990,2250647,no
Detection of Aspergillus antigens associated with invasive infection.,"Serial urine samples were collected from 33 neutropenic patients, 10 of whom developed invasive aspergillosis (IA) while undergoing bone marrow transplantation or remission induction therapy for leukemia. Concentrated urine samples from the infected patients were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted, and then incubated with antiserum raised to a cell wall extract of Aspergillus fumigatus (anti-CW) or an immunoglobulin G monoclonal antibody to A. fumigatus galactomannan (EBA1). When IA patient urine blots were probed with anti-CW, major bands at 11 and 18 kilodaltons (kDa) intermediate bands at 13, 14, and 29 kDa",1990,2229387,no
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. An increasingly common disorder among asthmatic patients.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), an immunologic disorder, is characterized by bronchial colonization with Aspergillus species, resulting in chronic antigenic stimulation. Hallmarks of the disorder are asthma, cutaneous and serologic evidence of hypersensitivity to Aspergillus organisms, and fleeting pulmonary infiltrates. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. Early diagnosis, aggressive therapy, and serial monitoring of serum IgE levels usually prevent progression of ABPA to bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, respiratory failure, and death.",1990,2204899,no
Cloning and expression of a second Aspergillus niger pectin lyase gene (pelA): indications of a pectin lyase gene family in A. niger.,"Using the previously cloned Aspergillus niger N756 pectin lyase D gene as a probe, the corresponding pelD gene has been isolated from a genomic library of the laboratory strain A. niger N400. This gene encodes PLD, previously described as PLI, which is one of the two major pectin lyases isolated from the commercial pectinase preparation Ultrazym. Heterologous hybridization of the A. niger N400 genomic library with the pelD gene led to the isolation of another five genes: pelA, B, C, E, and F. These genes differ in their hybridization patterns with probes containing either the entire pelD gene, or 5' or 3' parts thereof. By partial sequencing, and expression in an A. niger transformant containing multiple copies of the pelA gene, we show that this gene, which hybridizes strongest with the pelD gene, encodes the other major pectin lyase from Ultrazym, PLII.",1990,2225145,no
Immunochemical studies of Aspergillus fumigatus mycelial antigens by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting techniques.,"Differences were detectable among strains of the opportunist fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus when water-soluble (WS) preparations were analysed by combined SDS-PAGE and Western blotting procedures. A wide range of molecules of apparent molecular masses from approximately 20 to greater than 100 kDa showed specific binding to antibodies raised in rabbits to A. fumigatus wall and cytoplasmic components. The ability to bind antibody was markedly reduced by treatment of these antigens with sodium periodate or with specific proteases or glucanases. Pretreatment of blotted antigens with either concanavalin A (ConA) or wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) did not, however, inhibit subsequent antibody binding. The antigens of subfractions prepared from a single strain of A. fumigatus WS material were also susceptible to periodate oxidation and enzymic hydrolysis. Slight cross-reactivity was apparent when crude preparations of cellular or culture filtrate antigens, used in this laboratory to detect antibodies to Candida albicans, Coccidioides immitis and Cryptococcus neoformans, were probed with hyperimmune rabbit antisera to A. fumigatus. Efforts were made to characterize the WS preparations of A. fumigatus, used as diagnostic antigens in many laboratories. The electrophoretically separated antigenic moieties were shown to be predominantly glycoproteins. Binding of cytoplasmic antigens to antibodies raised to wall material showed the presence of many common components in both wall and cytosol. Antiserum to wall components revealed most differentiation among A. fumigatus strains.",1990,2175766,no
Chromatography and generation of specific antisera to synthetic peptides from a protective Boophilus microplus antigen.,"Four oligopeptides corresponding to predicted antigenic regions of the protective Bm86 glycoprotein of the cattle tick Boophilus microplus were synthesized and purified. Three were conjugated to carrier proteins and antisera raised in rabbits and cows. All elicited antipeptide antibodies that recognized Bm86 and recombinant derived products in Western blots however, only one produced antiserum capable of recognizing native Bm86 in an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Ticks fed in vitro on this antiserum showed no obvious gut damage.",1990,2229227,no
Use of immunoblotting to detect Aspergillus fumigatus antigen in sera and urines of rats with experimental invasive aspergillosis.,"Immunoblotting was used to detect Aspergillus fumigatus antigen in sera and urines of immunosuppressed rats experimentally infected with A. fumigatus. Organisms were administered by both intravenous and intratracheal injections. Intravenously infected rats developed disseminated aspergillosis, but intratracheally infected rats developed pulmonary disease only. Fungal cultures of blood and urine samples from infected rats were negative. In the urines of intravenously infected rats, antigen was detected 24 to 48 h after infection in the urines of intratracheally infected animals, antigen was detected on days 4 to 5 after infection. Antigen in serum was detected later than antigen in urine was. Following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting of serum and urine samples, the most strongly reacting antigenic materials were found in the 88-, 40-, 27-, and 20-kilodalton regions. These dominant antigens appeared to be the same as those of control antigens prepared from A. fumigatus grown in vitro. Rabbit antiserum to Aspergillus filtrate antigen was found to be more immunoreactive than antiserum to mycelial or conidial antigen. No mycelium-specific antigens were detected.",1990,2199519,no
Production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies to cell wall antigens of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Two murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against Aspergillus fumigatus were produced and characterized. Splenocytes from cell wall-immunized BALB/c mice were fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells. The hybridomas were screened with a cold alkali (CA) extract of mycelium containing protein, mannose, and galactose, and two MAbs of the immunoglobulin M class were purified from ascites fluid. MAbs 1 and 40 were characterized by double immunodiffusion against CA antigen, indirect enzyme immunoassay with mannans of Candida albicans serotypes A or B or Candida tropicalis, indirect immunofluorescence with C. albicans- or A. fumigatus-infected tissues, indirect immunofluorescence with smears of other pathogenic fungi, Western blotting (immunoblotting) with the lectin concanavalin A or BS-1 from the seeds of Bandeirea simplicifolia, and immunoelectron microscopy. MAb 1 did not cross-react with Candida mannan and recognized a periodate-sensitive, pronase- and heat-resistant epitope in CA antigen and three mannose- and galactose-containing components (80, 62, and 49 kilodaltons) of a mycelial homogenate. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated binding of MAb 1 to the inner cell wall and intracellular membranes of hyphae and conidia of A. fumigatus. Circulating antigen was detected in experimental invasive aspergillosis by inhibition enzyme immunoassay with MAb 1 and CA antigen. MAb 40 was a nonprecipitating antibody cross-reactive with Candida species, and competition for an epitope located diffusely in the cell wall of A. fumigatus hyphae was demonstrated by incubating MAb 40 with mannan of C. albicans serotype A. These results suggest that MAb 1 recognizes immunodominant oligogalactoside side chains of A. fumigatus galactomannan, while MAb 40 binds to mannopyranosyl side chains common to A. fumigatus galactomannan and C. albicans mannan.",1990,2194959,no
Sequential serological responses to Aspergillus fumigatus in patients with cystic fibrosis. Use of antigen 'stretching' to delineate IgG and IgE activity.,"Immunogens from Aspergillus fumigatus were fractionated on the basis of molecular weight. Nine fractions ranging from 900 to 10 kDa were used in ELISA and in a radioallergosorbent test (RAST) with sera from cases of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with ABPA or other Aspergillus involvement and compared with control subjects. The profile of IgG reactivity to the nine fractions did not vary substantially for all Aspergillus-involved groups producing peaks at greater than 900 kD and 170 kD whereas the profile for control subjects had a peak at greater than 900 kD only. The IgE profile for CF patients with ABPA did not differ from the profile of the RAST-positive CF patients without ABPA and provided only one peak of activity at 24 kD. Recovery from an episode of ABPA in CF patients was accompanied by a fall in both IgG and IgE antibody levels to all nine fractions, whereas increases in IgG and IgE to all fractions were seen during an episode of ABPA. Although there was an exaggerated IgG increase to antigens in the 43-170 kD range during ABPA, a meaningful increase was also observed to unfractionated A. fumigatus antigen preparations. With IgE in one detailed study the 24-kD fraction provided a better indication of Aspergillus involvement than the unfractionated A. fumigatus antigens. Sequential studies of IgG and IgE levels were not able to predict an episode of ABPA but were useful in conjunction with clinical assessment in following the course of the illness.",1990,2165878,no
False aneurysm infected by Aspergillus fumigatus: an unusual complication of aortofemoral bypass graft.,"Two cases of Aspergillus fumigatus infection of aortobifemoral prosthetic grafts are reported. Both patients were treated successfully by excision of the infected prosthetic material, axillofemoral extra-anatomic bypass, and prolonged medical treatment. The patients received amphotericin B, 5-flucytosine and itraconazole until negative aspergillus serology was obtained (at 9 and 18 months, respectively). Later, repeat disobliteration procedures for thrombosis of the axillofemoral bypass were required. No recurrent aspergillus infection was found.",1990,2163668,no
"Integration of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with conventional chromatographic procedures for quantitation of aflatoxin in individual cotton bolls, seeds, and seed sections.","Integration of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with conventional chromatographic methods proved the versatility of ELISA as a research tool and allowed for rapid assessment of aflaxtoxin in individual cottonseeds, parts of cottonseed, and composite samples of seeds taken from individual cotton bolls. Aqueous acetone was substituted for methanol in the extraction procedure prescribed by ELISA. The substitution allowed the use of a common extract for all analytical methods. An aliquot of the extract was used to screen samples by ELISA. Negative samples were identified, and toxin levels between 1 and 70 ng/g were quantitated by ELISA. Samples with toxin levels beyond the upper limit of detection by ELISA were then subjected to more time-consuming conventional cleanup prior to quantitation by liquid chromatography (LC) or thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Toxin levels detected by LC or TLC ranged from 100 to 845,000 ng/g sample. The screen by ELISA detected large numbers of toxin-negative cotton bolls or individual seeds in minimum analysis time. The combination of techniques verified the presence of seed with no toxin adjacent to toxin-containing seed in the same lock. Toxin-negative portions of individual seed with high toxin in another portion were identified for the first time. Integration of techniques provided needed information on distribution patterns of aflatoxin in cotton so that preventive measures can be developed.",1990,2120181,no
Gamma-tubulin is a component of the spindle pole body that is essential for microtubule function in Aspergillus nidulans.,"We have recently discovered that the mipA gene of A. nidulans encodes gamma-tubulin, a new member of the tubulin superfamily. To determine the function of gamma-tubulin in vivo, we have created a mutation in the mipA gene by integrative transformation, maintained the mutation in a heterokaryon, and determined the phenotype of the mutation in spores produced by the heterokaryon. The mutation is lethal and recessive. It strongly inhibits nuclear division, less strongly inhibits nuclear migration, and, as judged by immunofluorescence microscopy, causes a reduction in the number and length of cytoplasmic microtubules and virtually a complete absence of mitotic apparatus. We conclude that gamma-tubulin is essential for microtubule function in general and nuclear division in particular. Immunofluorescence microscopy of wild-type hyphae with affinity-purified, gamma-tubulin-specific antibodies reveals that gamma-tubulin is a component of interphase and mitotic spindle pole bodies. We propose that gamma-tubulin attaches microtubules to the spindle pole body, nucleates microtubule assembly, and establishes microtubule polarity in vivo.",1990,2194669,no
Identification and partial characterization of diagnostically relevant antigens of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Metabolic antigens of Aspergillus fumigatus, soil strain 2605 and sputum isolate, were evaluated for their diagnostic applicability using hyperimmune sera and sera of adults and pediatric patients of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. An indirect ELISA was standardised by using 2-10 micrograms/ml of coating antigen for detection of specific IgG and IgE antibodies in the sera of patients. The ratios of absorbance for specific IgE and IgG antibodies by ELISA (normal to patients) were observed to be in the range of 1:2 to 1:3 to 1:8 respectively. These antigenic preparations were further analyzed to identify and characterize the individual components by immunoblotting. This analysis indicated the presence of allergenic and antigenic determinants in the antigens of molecular weights 70, 34, and 28 Kd. The utility of the antigens of soil strain for diagnostic purpose is suggested.",1990,2203361,no
Pulmonary aspergillosis with bronchocentric granulomas.,"A 56-year-old Japanese man without asthma was admitted with cough, excessive sputum, and abnormalities on the chest X-ray film. The lung biopsy material showed necrotizing granulomas centered upon bronchioles. Serial sections of the material revealed a mass of well-oriented, uniform, viable-appearing aspergillus hyphae in the center of the granulomas. There was no evidence of blood eosinophilia, tissue infiltration of eosinophils, or deposition of immunoglobulins or complement in the granulomatous lesion. Thus, we obtained no direct evidence of an allergic reaction. After treatment with the antifungal drug, 5-flucytosine, the patient is in good health. This may be the first documentation of pulmonary aspergillosis showing predominantly bronchocentric granulomas in a nonasthmatic patient who was not immunocompromised.",1990,2183637,no
Improved production of chymosin in Aspergillus by expression as a glucoamylase-chymosin fusion.,We have extended the work on chymosin production in Aspergillus by constructing an expression vector in which the cDNA encoding bovine prochymosin B was fused in frame immediately following the codon for the last amino acid of the A. awamori glucoamylase (glaA) gene. Transformation of A. awamori with this plasmid led to the secretion of considerably higher amounts of chymosin than obtained with previous chymosin expression vectors. We present evidence that mature chymosin is autocatalytically released from the glucoamylase-chymosin fusion protein after secretion.,1990,1366537,no
The upstream region of the IPNS gene determines expression during secondary metabolism in Aspergillus nidulans.,"We have constructed a translational fusion between the isopenicillin-N-synthetase-encoding gene (IPNS) of Aspergillus nidulans and the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli. Recombinant strains carrying a single copy of the fusion integrated at the IPNS locus produced beta-galactosidase (beta Gal) during secondary metabolism. Integration of the fusion at the argB locus results in a situation in which the only 5'-flanking sequences of the IPNS gene upstream from the chimeric fused gene are those included in the transforming plasmid. Such a strain still expresses beta Gal activity during secondary metabolism, showing that a DNA fragment including sequences of the IPNS gene from nt -2000 to +35 (relative to the translation start codon) still contains sufficient information to drive expression of the fusion gene during secondary metabolism.",1990,2115487,no
[Development of a new system for selection of A. foetidus transformed with foreign genes by using thymidine kinase gene as a marker and expression of HBsAg gene in A. foetidus].,"A new system for selection of transformed Aspergillus foetidus was reported. In this system, TK- A. foetidus which were constructed by homologous recombination of mutated TK gene of vaccinia virus with TK gene of A. foetidus were screened by adding BUdR in agar plates. Conditions for screen of TK+ A. foetidus strain, transformation of A. foetidus and selection of transformed TK- A. foetidus have been studied. By using this system, several transformed A. foetidus which contained HBsAg gene derived bf a promoter H8 cloned from genomic DNA of A. foetidus were isolated. It was demonstrated that HBsAg gene was integrated into the chromosome DNA of A. foetidus by Southern blot after many passages of spores. ELISA showed that HBsAg was positive in the growth medium (p/n = 20). The 22 nm particles which were very similar to the HBsAg particles in human serum were found in the growth medium by immunoelectromicroscope. Western blot also gave the specific bands. All these data showed that HBsAg gene was expressed in A. foetidus and the products were secreted into the growth medium. The selection system using TK gene as marker could generally be used to study the expression of foreign gene in A. foetidus.",1990,2360327,no
Purification and characterization of polygalacturonases produced by the hyphal fungus Aspergillus niger.,"Five endo-polygalacturonases (poly(1,4-alpha-D-galacturonide) glycanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.15) and one exo-polygalacturonase (poly(1,4-alpha-D-galacturonide) galacturonohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.67) were isolated from a commercial pectinase preparation derived from Aspergillus niger. All five endo-enzymes could be purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography on cross-linked alginate, ion-exchange chromatography, chromatofocusing, and gel permeation chromatography. The exo-polygalacturonase was only partially purified but free from endo-polygalacturonase activity. The two most abundant endo-polygalacturonases (endo-I and endo-II), with molecular masses of 55 and 38 kDa, respectively, are quite different with respect to their isoelectric point, specific activity, mode of action on oligomeric substrates, and amino acid composition. The physicochemical properties of the other three endo-polygalacturonases (endo-IIIA, endo-IIIB, and endo-IV), present in low amounts, are quite similar to those of the endo-I type. The pH optima of all these endo-polygalacturonases are in the range of 4.3-4.9.",1990,2331322,no
Serum IgG antibody concentrations against environmental microbes in mares and foals during different seasons and effect of stabling practices.,"Over periods of 22 and 14 months, IgG antibody concentrations in serum samples obtained monthly from 14 mares and 19 foals, respectively, were measured by use of ELISA against antigens of the following environmental microbes: Aspergillus umbrosus, Penicillium brevicompactum, Rhodotorula glutinis, Absidia corymbifera, Aspergillus fumigatus, Humicola grisea, Micropolyspora faeni, and Thermoactinomyces vulgaris. The mares and foals were on pasture from early June until early October, then were stabled during the winter season until the following June. In the mares, increased antibody concentrations against most microbes were observed typically in midwinter and late spring when the horses were stabled antibody concentrations against R glutinis, however, peaked in August. Concentrations differed between the summer and winter seasons and, in most instances, between 2 consecutive years and correlated with amounts of rainfall during the previous harvest season. In the foals, circulating passively acquired antibodies disappeared within 3 to 4 months after birth. During the first year of life, substantially increased autogenous antibody concentrations were observed only against R glutinis. Antibody concentrations against the other microbes increased gradually toward the end of the indoor season. In a group of foals transferred indoors in autumn, 6 weeks later than the other foals, antibody concentrations were lower when measured in December. Results supported the view that, to minimize exposure to microbial spores during the winter season, horses should be kept outdoors as much as possible and attention should be focused on improving the ventilation in stables and the quality of feeds and beddings.",1990,2327613,no
"[Serological diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis--measurement of IgG-, IgM- and IgA- antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus by means of ELISA].","Serological diagnosis plays an important role in the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis, however, precipitation-in-gel test is neither sensitive nor quantitative. Recently, several investigators have used the ELISA technique for the detection of antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus and reported the usefulness of this method. In this report, we measured IgG-, IgM-, and IgA- antibody titers against Aspergillus fumigatus by means of ELISA in sera from patients with several different lung diseases including pulmonary aspergillosis. The results obtained were as follows: 1) Measurement of IgG-antibody titers was most useful for the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis. 2) Measurement of IgG-antibody titers was more sensitive than precipitation-in-gel test. 3) IgG-antibody titer was quantitative and reflected the clinical course of pulmonary aspergillosis.",1990,2198374,no
"[Baking ingredients, especially alpha-amylase, as occupational inhalation allergens in the baking industry].","Baker's asthma is the most frequent occupational lung disease in Switzerland and West Germany. Cereal flours, and more rarely flour parasites, are implicated as the responsible allergens. Based on an observation of a case of baker's asthma due to monovalent sensitization to alpha-amylase used as additive to flour, 31 bakers with occupational asthma and/or rhinitis were routinely tested by skin tests and serological RAST examinations for allergic sensitivity to flour, alpha-amylase and other bakery additives. 17/31 subjects (55%) reacted positively in scratch tests to a commercial powdered alpha-amylase and 13/20 (65%) to a lecithin preparation. 23/31 (74%) and 19/31 (61%) were RAST positive to wheat and to rye flour respectively. 32% had RAST specific IgE to alpha-amylase (from Aspergillus oryzae), 19.3% to soya bean flour and 16% to malt. 7/12 and 5/12 respectively reacted to trypsin inhibitor and lipoxidase, the main allergens in soya bean. In two patients monosensitization to alpha-amylase was present. In accordance with other reports we recommend that baking additives, especially alpha-amylase, should be tested in allergological diagnosis of occupational diseases in flour processing workers. Full declaration of all additives used in the bakery industry is needed.",1990,2326614,no
Allergic Bipolaris sinusitis: clinical and immunopathologic characteristics.,"Allergic Aspergillus sinusitis was first reported in 1983. We present the first three cases of allergic fungal sinusitis caused by the black fungus Bipolaris spicifera. The patients were young, atopic, and immunocompetent. All three patients demonstrated pansinusitis with nasal polyps and underwent multiple surgical procedures. Pathologic features included a characteristic mucoid exudate containing eosinophils, Charcot-Leyden crystals, and fungal hyphae. In two cases there was bony erosion revealed by computed tomography scan but no histologic evidence of direct fungal invasion into the mucosa or bony trabeculae. Immunologic features, including total eosinophil count, total serum IgE, immediate and late-phase skin response to B. spicifera, serum precipitins, and specific IgE and IgG to B. spicifera, are described. B. spicifera is a previously unrecognized cause of allergic fungal sinusitis that may be an underdiagnosed disorder. This diagnosis should be considered in atopic patients with nasal polyps and pansinusitis unresponsive to conventional medical therapy. Diagnostic criteria include characteristic histologic allergic mucin, culture identification of fungus, positive immediate cutaneous reactivity to fungal extract, positive serum precipitins, and elevated specific IgE and IgG antibodies.",1990,2312993,no
Fungal pneumonia in transplant recipients.,"Fungal pneumonia is an infrequent but devastating complication of solid organ transplantation. The suspicion of fungal pulmonary infections caused by the dimorphic fungi is based on particular knowledge about the recipient's past or present residence in an endemic area. Some fungi, such as Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida sp and Mucor sp are associated with concomitant diabetes mellitus. The level of immunosuppressive therapy is also a major predisposing factor. For some fungi, such as Coccidioides immitis and C neoformans, serologic tests may assist in diagnosis. For aspergillus, Candida sp and Mucor sp culture evidence is not sufficient to determine pulmonary involvement since these fungi may be nonpathogenic saprophytes. Histopathologic proof is required. In patients with abnormal host defenses, treatment of fungal pneumonia is complex. In solid organ transplant recipients it is made more difficult by drug interactions with cyclosporine. Amphotericin B exhibits synergistic nephrotoxicity with cyclosporine and ketoconazole competes with cyclosporine for hepatic metabolism in an unpredictable manner that may result in increased cyclosporine toxicity.",1990,2188321,no
Antibody isotype responses in Aspergillus-induced diseases.,"The Aspergillus fumigatus-specific immunoglobulin class and subclasses were evaluated in the sera of patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, aspergilloma, patients with asthma and immediate wheal-and-flare skin test reactivity to Aspergillus antigens, and normal controls. A sensitive sandwich enzyme immunoassay using a biotin-avidin amplification system was used to detect the specific antibodies. No difference was demonstrated in the specific antibody levels against A. fumigatus between the normal controls and A. fumigatus skin test-reactive asthmatic subjects except for immunoglobulin IgD and IgG4 isotypes. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) sera showed significant elevation of A. fumigatus-specific antibodies of all isotypes. On the other hand, aspergilloma sera, when compared with that of asthmatic individuals, showed significant increases of IgA, IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 antibodies. The specific antibodies belonging to both IgG1 and IgG2 subclasses were elevated in ABPA, the former predominant in 40% of cases and the latter in 60%, while in aspergilloma IgG1 was predominant. Among the initially diagnosed ABPA patients, all specific Ig isotypes were considerably elevated when compared with sera from other patients being treated with prednisone or when compared with sera from patients who became asymptomatic after treatment.",1990,2179434,no
Specific immuno-detection of benzoate-para-hydroxylase with antibodies raised against synthetic peptides.,"As a model system for the industrial use of fungal cells in the enzymatic conversion of chemicals, the parahydroxylation of benzoate was studied. To increase the amount of benzoate-para-hydroxylase (BPH, EC 1.14.13.12.) in the cell the gene coding for the enzyme (bphA) was cloned and expressed in Aspergillus niger. Detection of the enzymatic activity of the protein was not reproducible. It was decided to raise an antiserum for immuno-detection purposes. Sufficient benzoate-para-hydroxylase for immunization could not be obtained therefore the synthetic-peptide strategy was used. We demonstrate that synthesis of antigenic determinants, can be useful in the production of highly specific reagents for the detection of proteins. The availability of monospecific polyclonal sera opens new possibilities in functional studies and purification of benzoate-para-hydroxylase.",1990,1690004,no
Molecular cloning and deletion of the gene encoding aspergillopepsin A from Aspergillus awamori.,"We have cloned genomic pepA sequences encoding the aspartic proteinase aspergillopepsin A (PEPA) from Aspergillus awamori using a synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide probe. Nucleotide sequence data from the pepA gene revealed that it is composed of four exons of 320, 278, 249, and 338 bp. Three introns which interrupt the coding sequence are 51, 52, and 59 bp in length. Directly downstream from the putative start codon lies a sequence encoding 69 amino acids (aa) which are not present in mature PEPA. Based on similarities to other aspartic proteinases, this region may represent a 20-aa signal peptide followed by a 49-aa propeptide that is rich in basic aa residues. Northern blots of total cellular RNA extracted from A. awamori cells indicate that pepA is transcribed as a single 1.4-kb mRNA. Mutants of A. awamori lacking the pepA structural gene were derived by the following gene replacement strategy. First, we constructed a plasmid in which a 2.4-kb SalI fragment containing the entire pepA coding region was deleted from a 9-kb Eco RI genomic DNA clone and replaced by a synthetic DNA polylinker. Second, a selectable argB gene was inserted into the polylinker. Third, the EcoRI fragment which contained the argB marker flanked by pepA sequences was excised from the plasmid and used to transform an argB auxotroph of A. awamori. From 16-40% of the resulting prototrophic transformants were found to have a PEPA-deficient phenotype when screened with an immunoassay using antibodies specific for PEPA. Southern hybridization experiments confirmed that these mutants resulted from a gene replacement event at the pepA locus.",1990,2182390,no
[IgA antibodies in exogenous allergic alveolitis are more specific than IgG antibodies].,"Nineteen sera from patients suffering from extrinsic allergic alveolitis (bird fancier's lung, farmer's lung) and 19 sera from asymptomatic persons demonstrating IgG-antibodies were examined for IgA-antibodies against pigeon serum, Micropolyspora faeni and Aspergillus fumigatus. The IgA-antibodies against pigeon serum and Micropolyspora faeni were less of ten false-positive than the corresponding IgG-antibodies. Hence the IgA-antibodies were more specific than the IgG-antibodies. However, the sensitivity of the IgA-antibodies was lower than that of the IgG-antibodies. On the other hand IgA-antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus were scarcely more specific than the corresponding IgG-antibodies against pigeon and M. faeni. It would thus seem that IgA-antibodies can supplement the IgG-serodiagnosis of extrinsic allergic alveolitis.",1990,2367456,no
[Serologic studies in the diagnosis of pneumonia].,"The importance of serological determination procedures for the diagnosis of pathogens was investigated in 207 episodes of pneumonia. The pathogenic organisms were detected in 138 cases in 40 cases serological analysis helped to establish the diagnosis, while in 11 cases of pneumonia, the diagnosis was possible only with serology. The organisms most commonly found by serological investigations were Cytomegalovirus (n = 10), Aspergillus fumigatus (n = 7), and the influenza B virus (n = 7). Multiple infections, usually triggered by bacterial pathogens, were found in 48% of the cases of pneumonia with serological evidence of pathogens. In 71 episodes of pneumonia, the patients were immunosuppressed",1990,2367358,no
Detection of circulating galactomannan by Pastorex Aspergillus in experimental invasive aspergillosis.,"The performance of Pastorex Aspergillus, a new latex agglutination test for the detection of circulating galactomannan in the serum of patients with invasive aspergillosis, was evaluated in a blind trial in standardized guinea-pig models of invasive aspergillosis and other invasive mycoses. In these animal models, the invasive nature of the fungal infection was confirmed by re-isolation of the etiologic agent from the organs of every animal. Ninety-two plasma samples from 42 animals with invasive aspergillosis were submitted to the test. In 41 of these animals, at least one plasma sample was positive with the latex test (sensitivity 97.6%), titers ranging from 1/1 to 1/512. In general, antigen titers increased as a function of time, reaching the highest values shortly before death. Guinea-pigs infected with Penicillium marneffei also yielded positive agglutination reactions but antigen titers were lower (maximal titer 1/8). Plasma samples from animals with invasive candidosis (23), disseminated trichophytosis (11) and cryptococcosis (23) were all negative with the latex test. In 80 guinea-pigs without fungal infection, 3 false positive results (titers 1/1) were observed, which means a specificity of 96.2% in this control group.",1990,2191220,no
Correlation of IgE antibody titer to Aspergillus fumigatus with decreased lung function in cystic fibrosis.,"Obstructive pulmonary disease is a typical feature of cystic fibrosis (CF) and is often associated with bronchial hyperreactivity. Positive skin-test reactions to Aspergillus fumigatus antigens are frequently seen even in nonatopic patients with CF. Full-fledged allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) has been estimated to occur in 10% of patients with CF. The relationship between lung function and presence of IgE antibodies to Aspergillus antigens in patients without ABPA is not clear. In 148 outpatients with CF (aged 6-34 years) specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) to Aspergillus fumigatus antigens, basic lung-function parameters, and bronchial response to salbutamol were measured. Multiple regression was performed for age, weight as percentile for actual height (indicating general condition), and Aspergillus RAST. Aspergillus IgE was present in 46% of patients 19% had RAST class 3 or 4. Independent negative correlations of Aspergillus RAST with FEV1, FEF50%, FEF25%, RV, Chrispin Norman score, and sRaw (P less than 0.05) were found. Bronchodilator sensitivity did not correlate significantly with age and weight percentile. However, Aspergillus RAST did correlate significantly with bronchodilator response measured by sRaw (P less than 0.05). High titers of Aspergillus RAST might serve as a selective criterion for patients to be included in future studies evaluating broncholytic or antiphlogistic therapies.",1990,2405341,no
[Immunohistochemical identification of Aspergillus by monoclonal antibody EB-A1].,We have developed a new monoclonal antibody EB-A1 that recognizes Aspergillus sp. by immunoassay and in formalin fixed tissues.

Evaluation of an ELISA for the detection of anti-Histoplasma ribosomal and antihistoplasmin antibodies in histoplasmosis.,"We have developed an indirect sandwich enzyme-lined immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of antibodies to Histoplasma ribosomes and histoplasmin we used this test for demonstration of these antibodies in sera from proven cases of histoplasmosis and other infections. Serum dilutions from five negative controls used in each experiment were normalized against 50 normal sera, and a factor of the mean absorbance was used to establish a positive reaction. Antiribosomal antibodies were detected in 97% of the known histoplasmosis patients with ELISA titers ranging from 1:100 to over 1:12,800. In contrast, antibodies to histoplasmin were detected in only 75% of these sera",1990,2352056,no
Short-term curative treatment of Aspergillus fumigatus pneumonia with fluconazole.,"A 67-year-old previously healthy female presented with fever, malaise and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.

No side-effects were observed during or after treatment.",1990,2284583,no
[Endogenous candida endophthalmitis. Early diagnosis and early vitrectomy improve the prognosis].,"Our records on endogenous Candida endophthalmitis in 13 eyes in 10 patients are presented. The diagnosis was confirmed by culture from vitreous aspirate or serologic examination. The records show that cases with immediate diagnosis and treatment by antimycotics and vitrectomy have a better prognosis than late diagnosis or treatment without vitrectomy. Only the 4 cases that were vitrectomized within 4 weeks after onset of the complaints resulted in good visual acuity (greater than 2/5). The other cases were often complicated by traction, retinal scars or choroidal proliferation. Unclear uveitis with a high risk for fungal infection in the patient's history should be evaluated for Candida infection. Every patient with candidemia needs periodic ophthalmologic examinations for endophthalmitis. Diagnosis, treatment and possible prevention of endogenous Candida endophthalmitis are discussed.",1990,2210557,no
Immunopathological response of C57BL/6 and C3H/HeN mice to Aspergillus fumigatus antigens.,"C3H/HeN and C57BL/6 mice were exposed to culture filtrate (CF) and mycelial extracts (ME) of Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) intranasally. Animals received 6, 8 or 10 biweekly doses and were sacrificed 2 weeks after the last dose was administered. Specific antibodies against Af were detected in their sera by biotin-avidin-linked immunosorbent assay (BALISA). Antibodies against Af belonging to all isotypes showed an increase in both strains of mice. A progressive increase in IgG and IgA antibody isotypes against both CF and ME antigens was detected in C3H/HeN mice during the entire experimental period, whereas most antibody levels peaked after the 8th dose and remained steady or decreased slightly in the C57BL/6 strain. Lung lavage studies showed a relative decrease in the number of macrophages and an increase in the number of lymphocytes after the 6th and 8th instillation of Af antigens in both strains of mice. Histology of the lung demonstrated a progressive inflammatory reaction in C57BL/6 mice during the experimental period. On the other hand, the C3H/HeN mice showed a negligible inflammatory pulmonary reaction. The antibody responses and inflammatory changes detected in the lungs of mice exposed to Af antigens are comparable to allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in humans and hence this model will be of value in understanding the disease mechanism in ABPA and related diseases.",1990,2187818,no
Isolation and immunochemical characterization of fractions from membranes of Aspergillus fumigatus with protease activity.,"Two fractions exhibiting acid protease activity (AFPI and AFPII) were isolated by extraction of membrane vesicles of Aspergillus fumigatus with Triton X-100. These two fractions produced single bands in both polyacrylamide and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and showed apparent molecular weights of 73,000 and 43,000, respectively. Molecular weights determined by gel filtration in the absence and presence of Triton X-100 and sedimentation velocities in analytical ultracentrifugation indicated hydrophobic characteristics, since both fractions readily aggregated and complexed with Triton X-100 both exhibited elevated enzyme activities in the presence of Triton X-100. Carbohydrate content was 93% for AFPI and 85% for AFPII. The enzymatic fractions demonstrated different pH optima in the acid range as well as different temperature stabilities. Both protease fractions cross reacted in double immunodiffusion, while in crossed immunoelectrophoresis both demonstrated five precipitin peaks, each with similar patterns. AFPI demonstrated two additional precipitin peaks in crossed immunoelectrophoresis. As determined by crossed immunoaffinoelectrophoresis, the protease fractions demonstrated galactose and mannose residues. In biotin-avidin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay both fractions reacted with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and aspergilloma sera. It can be concluded that two fractions with protease activity of A. fumigatus reported here may be of significance in Aspergillus-induced diseases.",1990,2185869,no
Infection after liver transplantation.,"Infections occurring in liver transplant recipients result in significant morbidity and mortality. Factors influencing the frequency of posttransplant infections include pretransplant nutritional status, latent viral infections, and the degree of immunosuppression used to modulate the immune response to the allograft. Infectious agents may be introduced into the patient via the allograft, through infusion of blood products, and through intravenous lines, catheters, and drains. Infections also develop as a result of reactivation of latent viruses or by overgrowth or invasion by endogenous organisms. The intensity of the immunosuppressive regimen directly affects the frequency of infection. Infection may be categorized as bacterial, viral, fungal, or protozoal. The most frequent organisms include bacterial--enterobacteriaceae viral--cytomegalovirus",1990,2183644,no
[Studies of immunological activity of Aspergillus flavus Link. III. Presence of antibodies against fungal antigens in the sera of persons from selected groups].,"The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of antibodies against antigens of A. flavus (APP, AEM, AS, API), A. fumigatus and A. candidus. One hundred and fifty two sera of individuals connected with industrial environment were tested, in which A. flavus was permanently isolated: 339 sera of healthy controls-blood donors of city of Poznań, and 24 sera of patients with confirmed or suspected Aspergillosis were also included in the study. The sera were tested for a presence of specific antibodies by immunoprecipitation in 1% agar gel, by using inactivated sera and above mentioned antigens. In a group of people having permanent contact with A. flavus, antibodies to antigens derived from this genus were present in 4.6% of individuals while against A. fumigatus antigens in 0% and A. candidus 0.7%. In blood donors group 5 times lower percentage of sera having anti-A. flavus antibodies was found and a complete lack of detectable antibodies for other two genera. The results of the studies of patient sera indicate a necessity of broadening a set of fungal antigens used for an investigation of this type of sera. Antibodies against A. flavus were found in three patients and for A. fumigatus in 7 patients. One patient had antibodies for both genera and two patients had antibodies against A. flavus lacking antibodies against A. fumigatus. The results of this study indicate that antigens of A. flavus should be included into serodiagnosis of Aspergillosis.",1990,2128104,no
Detection of IgG and IgE antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus in human sera by immunogold assay.,"An immunogold assay (IGA) was developed to detect IgG and IgE antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus. Sixteen sera from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), aspergilloma, and normal controls were studied. All sera were also evaluated for antibodies against A. fumigatus by biotin-avidin linked enzyme immunosorbent assay (BALISA) and by agar gel double diffusion method. A. fumigatus specific IgG and IgE antibodies could be detected by IGA in all the patients' sera but not in the sera of normal controls. Both IgG and IgE antibodies to A. fumigatus could be demonstrated in all the sera by BALISA and normal controls showed only low levels of these antibodies. There was a positive correlation between the degree of reactivity detected by IGA, the BALISA titer and the precipitins by agar gel diffusion. It can be concluded that IGA is a reliable, sensitive and simple method capable of detecting both IgG and IgE antibodies against A. fumigatus in patient serum.",1990,2109199,no
"Monoclonal antibody-based enzyme linked immunosorbent assay of aflatoxin B1, T-2 toxin, and ochratoxin A in barley.","Aflatoxin B1 (B1), T-2 toxin (T2), and ochratoxin A (OA) were assayed in a single extract from barley grain by using competitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) with monoclonal antibodies. B1 and T2 monoclonal antibodies were conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for direct competitive ELISA while an indirect competitive ELISA was used for OA determination. The competitive ELISA detected 0.1 ng/mL of B1, 10 ng/mL of T2, or 1 ng/mL of OA. Acetonitrile-0.5% KCl-6% H2SO4 (89 + 10 + 1) extracts of barley grain either were diluted 1:10 for direct assay or were subjected to a simple liquid-liquid cleanup procedure to concentrate the extract 10:1 before assay. For cleanup, water was added to the acetonitrile extract to partition water-soluble interfering substances, and then the mycotoxins were re-extracted with chloroform. The chloroform extract was evaporated to dryness and redissolved in Tris HCl buffer for ELISA. The mean recoveries from barley spiked with 4-60 ng/g of B1, 50-5000 ng/g of T2, and 5-500 ng/g of OA were, respectively, 93.8, 80.6, and 95.8%. The mean within-assay, inter-assay, and subsample coefficients of variation by ELISA of barley grain colonized with toxigenic fungi were less than 12% for B1 and OA but as high as 17% for T2.",1990,2107178,no
[Comparison of oral fluconazole and amphotericin B prophylaxis against fungal infections in the neutropenic phase of patients treated with antileukemic agents].,"Forty patients with acute leukemia (age 16-71 years, 13 females, 27 males) with induced neutropenia due to chemotherapy received either 50 mg fluconazole or 800 mg amphotericin B per day orally as prophylaxis against fungal infection. Nasal and genital swabs, mouth washings, urine, stool and blood serum were taken for mycological and serological examination before and weekly during one episode of neutropenia (less than 10(9) granulocytes/l) per patient. The quantitative determination of the yeast concentration in stool specimens demonstrated that amphotericin B led to intestinal yeast count reduction in only one third of the patients and could not prevent the increase of the intestinal yeast flora in another third of the patients. Beyond that the quantitative determination of yeast colonization in oropharynx, genital region, blood and stool did not prove to be a reliable tool for evaluating the host-fungus relationship during neutropenia. On the other hand mycoserology reflected episodes of candidosis well. 19 patients treated with fluconazole showed only minor titer increases. In 21 patients treated with amphotericin B, four fungemias were found: two by both hemagglutination (HAT) and immunofluorescence (IFT), one by IFT and one by antigen detection (Ramco Cand-Tec) alone. In only one of these cases yeast cells were released in urine. From these results is concluded that control of serology is essential in studies of that type and that fluconazole seems to provide better protection from candidosis than amphotericin B during induced neutropenia.",1990,2101864,no
Evidence that the M antigen of Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum is a catalase which exhibits cross-reactivity with other dimorphic fungi.,"A panel of monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) was raised against histoplasmin, the antigen derived from the mycelial phase of Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum which contains the diagnostically useful H and M antigens. A number of Mabs were obtained which recognized a 70-75 kD component of an antigenic preparation of H. capsulatum var. capsulatum by Western blotting. When reacted with histoplasmin by Western blotting the Mabs recognized a similar 70-75 kD band, together with a series of higher molecular mass bands at approximately 130, 190 and 230 kD, a pattern which correlates strongly with both the published relative molecular mass (Mr) of the M antigen and the known subunit structure of the enzyme catalase. These Mabs were also shown to recognize a commercial preparation of Aspergillus niger catalase by ELISA. Other dimorphic fungi were also reactive with these Mabs by Western blotting, indicating the presence of common epitopes on the catalase molecules of these species.",1990,2093121,no
Detection of circulating Aspergillus fumigatus antigen in bone marrow transplant patients.,"A competitive inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay able to detect Aspergillus fumigatus antigenemia at a concentration sensitivity of 68 ng/ml was developed. To test the utility of this assay in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis, serum was collected twice weekly from all patients in a bone marrow transplant unit. When analyzed retrospectively, A. fumigatus antigen was detected in three of four patients (75%) with proved invasive aspergillosis at autopsy or biopsy and in a solitary patient with suspected but not proved invasive aspergillosis. No antigen was detected in 17 bone marrow transplant unit patients without proved or suspected invasive aspergillosis or in 16 healthy control subjects. Detection of antigen rose with an increasing number of samples tested. A. fumigatus antibody levels were not helpful in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis, although in a few patients antibody levels decreased just before death.",1989,2687424,no
Specific IgE antibodies to 16 widespread mold genera in patients with suspected mold allergy.,"A panel of 55 sera from patients with suspected mold allergy from two different geographic areas, A and B, was investigated for specific IgE antibodies to 16 individual molds using Phadebas RAST technique. The molds investigated were Alternaria, Cladosporium, Aspergillus, Penicillium, Mucor, and Candida from the former RAST panel and ten additional new mold genera. The RAST screening revealed that 73% of patients had specific IgE antibodies to at least one of the 16 molds. Eighteen percent were negative to the six molds of the previous RAST panel but had specific IgE antibodies to at least one of the ten new molds. The highest frequency of IgE antibodies in the A group could be assigned to Cladosporium, followed by Botrytis and Helminthosporium. In group B, sensitivity to Botrytis and Phoma showed the highest frequencies. This study revealed that the relative importance of mold genera may vary greatly between patient groups from different geographic areas. Some of the species of the expanded RAST panel seem to be at least as important as Alternaria and Cladosporium. Multiple sensitivities seem to be caused by sensitization by many mold species rather than by cross-reactivity.",1989,2596762,no
Prospective evaluation of a Candida antigen detection test for invasive candidiasis in immunocompromised adult patients with cancer.,"Serologic tests to detect invasive candidiasis generally have been unreliable. We prospectively evaluated the clinical utility of a new, promising commercial latex particle agglutination test (i.e., Cand-Tec, Ramco Laboratories, Inc., Houston, Texas). This assay detects Candida antigens in serum.We examined the reliability of Cand-Tec to diagnose invasive candidiasis in 142 consecutive in-patients intensively treated with chemo-radiation therapy. Serum samples were collected at admission and then weekly, until the patients' death or hospital discharge. Evaluation for clinical utility was done using various reference titers. Twenty-nine patients had invasive candidiasis whereas 113 patients did not have documented invasive candidal infections.At a titer of 1:8, the Cand-Tec test had sensitivity of 38%, specificity of 90%, positive predictive value of 50%, and negative predictive value of 85%. Weekly use of the Cand-Tec test did not improve early detection of invasive candidiasis, providing only a mean interval of 0.4 day from the first positive Cand-Tec result to a definitive diagnosis of invasive candidiasis by blood culture, tissue biopsy, or autopsy. In addition, surveillance cultures from the oropharynx or stool were not helpful in identifying those patients who would develop an invasive fungal infection.In the context of current clinical management strategies for suspected fungal infection, the Candida antigen detection assay (Cand-Tec) is not a reliable method for diagnosis of deep candidiasis in neutropenic patients. Until better methods of early detection are available, patients at high risk for the development of invasive candidiasis should continue to receive empiric antifungal agent therapy.",1989,2589397,no
Immunological differentiation of Penicillium species.,"Antisera were obtained from a rabbit immunized with Penicillium verrucosum var. verrucosum. These antisera were characterized by immunofluorescence and by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for their reactivity with 44 strains of moulds. Antigenically, P. verrucosum var. verrucosum (subgenus Penicillium) appears to be similar to strains belonging to subgenus Furcatum, but strongly different from Penicillium frequentans (subgenus Aspergilloides). Specific absorption of antibodies to antigens confirmed the existence of similar biochemical structures on Penicillium frequentans, Aspergillus versicolor, and Aspergillus fumigatus. Immunological procedures may thus significantly contribute to refine the taxonomic classification of moulds.",1989,2692798,no
Coccidioidomycosis: clinical update.,"Over the last decade coccidioidomycosis, a fungal infection endemic to the desert Southwest of the United States, has gained national prominence. This review summarizes recent advances in the clinical understanding of this disease. Immunosuppressive therapy and infection with the human immunodeficiency virus are recognized risk factors for the development of severe, progressive disease. Although relatively uncommon, extrapulmonary dissemination of Coccidioides immitis can lead to chronic infection of the skin, bones, and meninges. Culture and histologic examination are important in establishment of the diagnosis, but serologic tests remain both diagnostically and prognostically useful. Treatment is problematic. Coccidioidomycosis is an unpredictable disease, and assessments of drug efficacy are difficult. Ketoconazole is challenging amphotericin B as the preferred treatment for some manifestations. However, many of the adverse effects of ketoconazole have only recently been recognized. Newer antifungal agents, such as fluconazole and itraconazole, hold promise for the future.",1989,2690287,no
Problems in management of opportunistic fungal diseases.,"Opportunistic fungal infections are now common and will become more common as a consequence of the use of various regimens of immunosuppressive therapy for a variety of diseases and because of AIDS. These infections can be broadly divided into those that take advantage of a neutrophil defect (e.g., candidiasis, aspergillosis, and mucormycosis) and those that take advantage of a T cell mononuclear phagocyte defect (e.g., cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, and coccidioidomycosis). Problems in diagnosis have been apparent since these infections were first recognized. The usual clinical specimens are often not revealing, and attempts to develop special serologic and biochemical tests have been made for years, but progress has been slow. Problems in treatment stem first from a lack of an early diagnosis and second from a lack of drugs that are effective and relatively nontoxic. It is difficult to evaluate new drugs if we cannot make accurate diagnoses this difficulty is compounded by the low rate of autopsies in the academic hospitals where such studies are conducted.",1989,2532389,no
Comparison of immunodiffusion and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies to four Aspergillus species.,"Antigenic extracts were prepared from Aspergillus fumigatus, A niger, A flavus and A terreus for use in enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunodiffusion (ID) tests for Aspergillus antibodies to determine whether the use of antigenic extracts from species other than A fumigatus increased the sensitivity of the ELISA. ELISA titres correlated well with positive ID tests. Patient titres by ELISA were significantly higher than control titres for all species. Patient titres to A niger were also significantly higher than titres to the other species. Total number of ID bands to A fumigatus correlated significantly with anti-A fumigatus ELISA titres. It is concluded that the use of antigenic extracts from species other than A fumigatus improves the sensitivity of the ELISA.",1989,2511230,no
A full length cDNA clone for the alkaline protease from Aspergillus oryzae: structural analysis and expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"We have cloned and determined the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA fragment for the entire coding region of the alkaline protease (Alp) from a filamentous ascomycete Aspergillus oryzae. According to the deduced amino acid sequence, Alp has a putative prepro region of 121 amino acids preceding the mature region, which consists of 282 amino acids. A consensus sequence of a signal peptide consisting of 21 amino acids is found at the N-terminus of the prepro region. The primary structure of the mature region shares extensive homology (29%-44%) with those of subtilisin families, and the three residues (Asp 32, His 64 and Ser 221 in subtilisin BPN') composing the active site are preserved. The entire cDNA, coding for prepro Alp, when introduced into the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, directed the secretion of enzymatically active Alp into the culture medium, with its N-terminus and specific activity identical to native Aspergillus Alp.",1989,2693947,no
Aspergillus findings in AIDS patients suffering from cryptococcosis.,"Because of the known pathogenicity of Cryptococcus neoformans and of aspergilli depending on defined but different immunodeficiencies of the host, the evaluation of their simultaneous cultural detection in specimens of the respiratory tract of AIDS patients is of epidemiological, diagnostic, pathogenetic and therapeutic interest. In 10 out of 15 AIDS patients the following species of the genus Aspergillus could be isolated either once or repeatedly during the course of Cr. neoformans infections in specimens from the respiratory tract: A. fumigatus, A. flavus, A. nidulans, A. niger and A. glaucus. From the 10 different case reports the conclusion can be drawn that the cultural findings of aspergilli in specimens from the respiratory tract during the course of cryptococcosis were of no pathogenic significance. Rather, they should be interpreted as inhaled and not yet germinated conidia still capable of growth lacking primary pathogenicity for the AIDS patient. The significance of serodiagnosis for the evaluation of the simultaneous occurrence of Cr. neoformans and Aspergillus spp. is demonstrated and discussed.",1989,2685598,no
[Extrinsic allergic alveolitis: IgG subclass reactivities and monoclonal antibodies against Micropolyspora faeni and Aspergillus fumigatus].,"IgG-subclass reactivities to Micropolyspora faeni of farmer's lung patients and exposed persons were investigated. Additionally, specific IgG and IgE antibodies of patients suffering from IgE-mediated allergy and extrinsic allergic alveolitis to Aspergillus fumigatus and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) were examined. Antibody reactivities of patients were compared with reactivities of monoclonal antibodies raised against M. faeni and A. fumigatus, respectively. The results indicate a special importance of specific IgG2 reactivity for serologic diagnosis. Monoclonal antibodies raised against M. faeni and A. fumigatus recognize components which induce antibody production in patients as well. Reactivities of monoclonal antibodies with different batches of A. fumigatus extract show the variability of these antigen preparations and illustrate the need for standardization.",1989,2684845,no
[A case of bronchopulmonary aspergillosis recurring in a residual tuberculous cavity].,"A 52-year-old man, who had undergone right upper lobectomy because of active tuberculosis 29 years before, was admitted with complaints of severe cough and expectation. Two years ago, he had pulmonary aspergillosis and was successfully treated with some anti-mycotic agents. This time his chest X-P showed fungus ball in a residual tuberculous cavity in the right upper field and he was diagnosed as pulmonary aspergilloma from the results of radiological findings, sputum culture, and serologic test. By bronchofiberscopy fungus ball was observed. With transbronchial infusion of Amphotericin B, intravenous administration of Miconazole and oral administration of Flucytosine, clinical symptoms have improved and lysis of fungus ball was observed. Sputum culture revealed Aspergillus flavipes group. Bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, which was incurable by surgical treatment because of underlying disease, was successfully treated with transbronchial infusion of Amphotericin B and administration of some anti-mycotic agents.",1989,2811014,no
Fluctuations of serum IgA and its subclasses in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"Exacerbations of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) are characterized by chest roentgenographic infiltrates, peripheral blood eosinophilia, and elevation of total serum IgE. Also elevated are serum immunoglobulin antibodies directed against Aspergillus fumigatus, IgE-Af, serum IgG-Af, and serum IgA-Af. We measured serum IgA-Af, IgA1-Af, and IgA2-Af by ELISA to determine whether elevations of IgA-Af occurred before or during an exacerbation (like IgG-Af) or after (like IgE-Af). Ten exacerbations of ABPA were studied in seven patients with an average of 10 serial sera per patient analyzed. We used an indirect amplified ELISA with Af initially sensitizing microtiter wells. A ""serologic"" rise of immunoglobulin Af was identified when optical densities were twice the baseline sera. Serum IgA-Af was elevated over baseline before (n = 5) and during (n = 1) the time of an exacerbation. Serum IgA1-Af was elevated over baseline before (n = 5) or at the time (n = 5) of an exacerbation in all 10 cases. Serum IgA2-Af was elevated before (n = 2) and during (n = 5) exacerbations. Analogous to total serum IgE and IgG-Af, these experiments demonstrate substantial elevations of serum IgA-Af, IgA2-Af, and particularly, IgA1-Af before or during exacerbations characterized by roentgenographic infiltrates. The data are consistent with a contributory role of IgA-Af in the pathogenesis of ABPA.",1989,2778243,no
Immunochemical assay applied to mycotoxin biosynthesis: ELISA comparison of sterigmatocystin production by Aspergillus versicolor and Aspergillus nidulans.,"Conventional thin layer and instrumental methods for analyzing mycotoxins and their precursors are time-consuming and make the investigation of mycotoxin biosynthesis particularly difficult. As an alternative, sensitive enzyme-liked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) can be utilized to analyze for these compounds. In this report, sterigmatocystin production in test tube cultures of Aspergillus versicolor ATCC 18643 and Aspergillus nidulans ATCC 32610 were compared using competitive ELISA. Polyclonal antiserum that was prepared against a sterigmatocystin hemiacetal-bovine serum albumin conjugate exhibited greatest specificity for sterigmatocystin hemiacetal and sterigmatocystin with less reactivity for O-methylsterigmatocystin. The antiserum could be used to detect as little as 50 ng/ml sterigmatocystin in ELISA. Direct ELISA could be performed on diluted culture broth and on mycelial extracts solubilized with N,N-dimethylformamide. Aspergillus versicolor ATCC 18643 produced more sterigmatocystin in SLS medium than in YES medium, and showed maximal levels at between 9 to 12 days incubation. Approximately 75% of sterigmatocystin was detectable in mycelium (254 micrograms/ml culture) compared to the extracellular fraction (87 micrograms/ml culture). Aspergillus nidulans exhibited qualitatively similar patterns of growth and toxigenesis in SLS medium but accumulated maximal levels of only 15 micrograms mycelial sterigmatocystin/ml culture and 5 micrograms extracellular sterigmatocystin/ml broth, respectively.",1989,2693965,no
Chronic inflammatory cells with epithelial cell characteristics in teleost fishes.,"Certain cells that participate in the chronic inflammatory response of teleost fishes have many features typical of epithelioid cells of mammals. Such features include high metabolic activity, frequent phagolysosomes, and cytoplasmic interdigitations between adjacent cells however, the epithelioid granulomas formed in response to certain diseases in teleost fishes also have several features associated with epithelial cells. Cases of ulcerative mycosis or acid-fast bacterial infection in Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), fungal infection in silver perch (Bairdiella chrysoura), and mycobacteriosis in Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) had epithelioid cells that were joined together by well-formed desmosomes with tonofilaments. ""Mature granulomas"" of the ulcerative mycosis-infected menhaden stained positively for cytokeratin, a cytoskeletal protein that is considered to be highly specific for epithelial cells. The consistent presence of these heretofore unrecognized epithelial features suggest that they may be characteristic of certain types of cells participating in piscine chronic inflammation.",1989,2686148,no
Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for zygomycosis.,"A 2-h indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using homogenate antigens of Rhizopus arrhizus and Rhizomucor pusillus was developed and compared with the existing immunodiffusion (ID) test for zygomycosis, using homogenate antigens of R. arrhizus. Utilizing 1:400 as a minimally positive ELISA titer, 33 of 43 proven cases of zygomycosis were diagnosed. The sensitivity of the ELISA was 81%. The ID test, in contrast, detected only 21 cases and demonstrated a sensitivity of 66%. The specificity of the ELISA was 94%, whereas that of the ID test was 91%. Nonspecific ELISA reactivity was particularly evident with sera from patients with aspergillosis and candidiasis. With the antigens now available, the ELISA was unable to generically or specifically identify the etiologic agents.",1989,2674194,no
The effects of age on isotypic antibody responses to Aspergillus fumigatus: implications regarding in vitro measurements.,"The demonstration of elevated serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), immunoglobulin G (IgG), and immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) is a valuable aid in the serodiagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). It is important to recognize cases of ABPA, because repeated untreated episodes of pulmonary infiltrates can result in bronchiectasis and even fatal fibrotic lung disease. Serum samples from patients with ABPA have increased isotypic antibodies to Af when compared with patients with asthma and immediate cutaneous reactivity but in whom ABPA has been excluded. There is little information regarding age-related changes of isotypic antibodies to a specific allergen or in comparison of such changes with age-related changes in total class-specific antibody. We determined IgE-Af, IgG-Af, and IgA-Af and total IgE, IgG, and IgA concentrations in serum samples from children with asthma (ages less than 1 through 5 years, 6 through 10 years, and 11 through 15 years) and compared the results with those in children with APBA and adults with asthma. The use of an indirect amplified ELISA with Af adsorbed to microtiter wells demonstrated that serum samples from children with ABPA have elevated IgE-Af, IgG-Af, and IgA-Af concentrations compared with those in serum samples from children with asthma. The assays were sensitive and highly specific in discriminating ABPA from asthma in children. Isotypic antibodies to Af in children do not demonstrate age-related increases as occur for total serum IgE, IgG, and IgA concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1989,2671215,no
Lack of cross-reactivity between IgE to salmon and protamine sulfate.,Immediate type-generalized reactions to protamine sulfate are uncommon but may be fatal. The mechanisms of severe or fatal reactions are unknown in most cases. One theory is that contaminating fish (salmon) proteins present in protamine solutions induce anaphylaxis in salmon-sensitive subjects. A second hypothesis is that protamine interacts with anti-salmon IgE to cause anaphylaxis. We assessed these hypotheses by establishing an indirect amplified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgE to salmon. Sera obtained from two subjects anaphylactically sensitive to salmon demonstrated high binding to salmon that was not inhibited by preincubation of sera with 500 or 1000 micrograms of protamine or Aspergillus fumigatus. Serum from a patient who experienced anaphylactic shock from protamine was indistinguishable from control sera in the ELISA for IgE to salmon. Anti-protamine IgE could not be demonstrated in separate experiments. The assays prove that 1) serum IgE to salmon is not inhibited by protamine and 2) serum from a patient experiencing a severe reaction to protamine did not contain IgE to salmon or protamine. The experiments do not support the notion that there is cross-reactivity between IgE to salmon and protamine sulfate in the cases evaluated.,1989,2764017,no
Reactivities of immunoglobulin E and immunoglobulin G subclasses identified by isoelectric focusing-immunoprint in allergic patients.,"Probing of IgE or IgG subclass reactivities on single allergenic components in an extract is tedious and time-consuming under native conditions. Isoelectric focusing immunoblotting combines a powerful, highly resolving native separation method with the specificity and sensitivity of immunological test methods. This method is easy and quick to perform. The potential usefulness of this method is demonstrated by eight examples of a type I or type III allergy analyzing IgE and IgG subclass reactivities and their distribution.",1989,2680477,no
"Aspergillus fumigatus, the causative agent of infection of the frontal sinuses and nasal chambers of the dog.","Twenty-nine cases of nasal aspergillosis out of 150 dogs with nasal discharge were recorded in dogs based on cultural, serologic, radiologic, endoscopic and histopathologic studies. In all of the 29 cases the thermotolerant, rhinotropic Aspergillus fumigatus was cultured from the nasal lesions. The fungal infection mostly occurred in male German shephard dogs, the most common breed of companion dogs, living in apartments.",1989,2677714,no
Antibody response to low-molecular-weight antigens of Aspergillus fumigatus in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"Sera from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) or aspergilloma and normal sera were analyzed for specific antibodies by Western (immuno-) blotting with Aspergillus fumigatus antigens transferred electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Western blot analysis demonstrated consistent reactivity of low-molecular-weight A. fumigatus antigens against ABPA sera but not against uncomplicated aspergilloma or normal sera. None of these low-molecular-weight components had any lectin-binding activity. Sera from patients with aspergilloma, however, frequently reacted with high-molecular-weight components of A. fumigatus. The majority of these high-molecular-weight antigenic components demonstrated concanavalin A-binding activity. The low-molecular-weight bands were discernible in Western blots with sera from all ABPA patients irrespective of disease activities, such as relapse, flare, or treatment. Antibodies detected by methods such as immunodiffusion or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays demonstrated total antibody responses to most or all antigenic components, while Western blots demonstrated the reactivities of the individual components with the specific antibodies. Western blot analysis thus provided more information for immunodiagnosis of ABPA than other methods, especially when only crude antigens were available.",1989,2666440,no
Organization of microbiology laboratory services for the diagnosis of pulmonary infections in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection.,"When faced with the ever-increasing demand for the rapid laboratory diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), as well as a variety of fungal, parasitic, and bacterial opportunistic infections in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected individuals, the Chest Service and the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory at San Francisco General Hospital developed a coordinated plan for the collection and rapid examination of specimens to allow presumptive diagnoses to be made as quickly as possible. Clinical studies have been performed to determine the efficacy of different specimens and diagnostic systems for the provision of clinically useful information. Our approach has been to provide medical care on an outpatient basis using less invasive diagnostic systems that do not require direct physician participation. Direct laboratory examination of a single specimen submitted to microbiology often yielded presumptive or final diagnoses that were directly communicated to the physician. The evolution of PCP diagnosis in AIDS patients is described. Our current procedure of examining mucolysed, concentrated induced sputum stained with a rapid Giemsatype stain, Diff-Quik (Baxter/Scientific Products, McGaw, IL), has a sensitivity for P carinii detection of 74% to 77%. We have found that the use of commercially available immunofluorescence staining diminishes screening time and increases the sensitivity of P carinii detection in mucolysed concentrated induced sputum. We also describe the appearance of bacterial, fungal, and parasitic agents seen on direct examination and the usefulness of antigen detection, serology, and various microbiologic culture systems for diagnosing infections caused by these organisms.",1989,2473507,no
Analytical methods for aflatoxins in corn and peanuts.,"Aflatoxin determinations can be approached many ways. Peanuts and corn are more often contaminated with aflatoxins B1 and B2 than with aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2. Some countries are only interested in B1 content and others are interested in the total aflatoxin content. It is essential to safely handle all experimental materials associated with aflatoxin analyses or the aflatoxigenic fungi. Visual screening of suspect peanut lots, based on the presence of conidial heads of the Aspergillus flavus group, and screening corn for the presence of bright greenish yellow fluorescence (BGYF) are not chemical tests and such screening techniques may allow aflatoxin contaminated lots into commerce. Minicolumn screening procedures should always be used in conjunction with a quantitative method. Several thin layer chromatography (TLC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods are suitable for quantitation and are in general use. Immunochemical methods such as the ELISA or affinity column methods are being rapidly developed. The chemical and immunochemical methods can be reliable if care is taken, using suitable controls and personnel that are well-trained. All analytical laboratories should stress safety and include suitable analytical validation procedures.",1989,2730149,no
[Allergenic and antigenic activities of the osmophilic fungus Wallemia sebi asthmatic patients].,"Recently large amounts of Wallemia sebi, a species of osmophilic fungi, have been detected in house dust by low water activity media. The allergenic activity of W. sebi was examined by skin prick tests and radioallergosorbent tests (RAST) in 74 asthmatic patients (mean age 11.7, range 6-32). Aspergillus fumigatus and house dust were used for comparison. In the skin prick tests, W. sebi extract, A. fumigatus extract and house dust extract elicited positive reactions in 4 (5.4%), 4 (5.4%) and 51 (68.9%) patients, respectively. RAST showed positive results in 14 subjects (18.9%) for W. sebi extract, in 8 (10.8%) for A. fumigatus extract and in 59 (79.7%) for house dust extract. These results indicated that some asthmatic individuals showed immediate type hypersensitivity to W. sebi, which means this fungal species may be important as a causative agent in atopic diseases. Additionally, the authors measured W. sebi-specific IgG by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in asthmatic (n = 28) and non-atopic patients (n = 28). W. sebi-specific IgG was found in sera from all subjects in each group. W. sebi-specific IgG in asthmatics (mean +/- SD = 0.686 +/- 0.160) was significantly higher than that in non-atopics (mean +/- SD = 0.572 +/- 0.188) (p less than 0.01).",1989,2783035,no
Sporotrichosis.,"Sporotrichosis is a chronic fungal infection that most commonly involves the skin and lymphatics. It is classified into five forms: classic lymphocutaneous, fixed cutaneous, disseminated cutaneous, primary pulmonary, and systemic sporotrichosis. Its diagnosis is established by fungal culture or by direct immunofluorescence. Safe effective therapy for cutaneous sporotrichosis exists in the form of oral potassium iodide and local heat therapy. However, itraconazole, one of the newer triazole antimycotic agents, appears quite effective against Sporothrix schenckii and may provide a means of reducing both the length of therapy and the relapse rate. Systemic sporotrichosis, although still rare, is becoming more common, especially in immunosuppressed patients. Because of multisystem involvement, both diagnosis and management of patients with systemic sporotrichosis are difficult. Serologic antibody tests such as the slide latex agglutination test are useful to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the effectiveness of antifungal therapy. Intravenous amphotericin B is still considered the drug of choice for systemic sporotrichosis, but the search for a less toxic agent continues. Also, combination drug therapy and surgical intervention are necessary for some patients with extracutaneous sporotrichosis.",1989,2670365,no
[Aspergillus fumigatus: evaluations of the standardization of diagnostic extracts].,"Extracts of Aspergillus fumigatus used for serodiagnosis of allergic diseases are of unknown and nonstandardized composition. Applying immunoprint technique subsequent to isoelectric focusing commercial and self-prepared extracts are compared.

It is suggested to use monoclonal antibodies as secondary standards as well as to improve standardization.",1989,2654008,no
Immunoprint pattern in patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in different stages.,"Individual immunoprint patterns of sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-separated Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) allergens/antigens were evaluated in 28 patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in stages II to V. It could be demonstrated that active disease (stage III) is characterized by a very strong IgE response against a variety of Af components, whereas the IgE antibody pattern in corticosteroid-treated patients who have demonstrated improvement is much weaker. In patients in remission (stage II), it is minimal. In contrast, many patients in stage V without corticosteroid treatment demonstrated a strong reactivity of IgE antibodies, indicating persisting active disease. The pattern of IgG antibodies with individual Af components resembles, in general, that of IgE antibodies however, discrimination between different stages and between treated patients is much weaker. Our results indicate that a certain relationship between the different stages of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and Af immunoprint patterns exists.",1989,2651510,no
Lymphocyte sensitization to Aspergillus fumigatus in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation induced by an extract of Aspergillus fumigatus (AF) was examined in patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), all of whom had an immediate skin prick test reaction (SPT) and increased RAST binding to AF, and, for comparison, in individuals without immediate SPT reactivity or increased RAST binding to AF. The proliferative responses of PBMC from the ABPA patients were greater than those from the comparison donors. A substantial proportion of the comparison group, however, showed evidence of a specific immune response to AF, with AF-specific IgG measured by ELISA and specific lymphoproliferative responses. AF-responsive T cell lines and T cell clones were established from both ABPA patients and IgE-negative individuals. These clones, of helper/inducer (CD4+) phenotype, showed antigenic specificity and MHC restriction. The stimulating antigen was determined for four of six clones derived from a skin-prick-test-negative individual, and found to be of Mr 18 kD, possibly the major allergen, 'Ag 3'. ABPA patients showed a marked diminution of the proliferative response during disease exacerbation.",1989,2525438,no
In vitro T cell responses in patients with cystic fibrosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) occurs as a complication in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Previous studies of the immunopathogenesis of ABPA have indicated that B cells (IgG and IgE antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus), T cells, and eosinophils are components of the disease. To evaluate T-cell regulation, we examined in vitro immune responses in seven patients with CF and ABPA compared with subjects who had a positive reaction to an A. fumigatus (Af) prick skin test, an IgG precipitating antibody test, or both (ST/PPT), and with subjects with CF who had negative prick skin test results and precipitating antibodies to Af (Af negative). Analyses of T-cell phenotypes revealed that patients with CF and ABPA compared with patients with CF who had ST/PPT positive and Af negative results had slightly increased percentages of T-helper cells, 50.1% versus 43.0% (p not significant) and 42.2 (p less than 0.025), respectively, but comparable percentages and numbers of T-suppressor cells. Serum IgE concentrations were significantly increased in subjects with CF and ABPA versus both subjects who had ST/PPT-positive and Af-negative results, 2916 versus 281 and 73 IU/ml (p less than 0.001 and less than 0.001, respectively). In addition, B cells from patients with CF and ABPA had significantly increased in vitro preformed IgE (p less than 0.01) and increased spontaneous de novo IgE spontaneous synthesis compared with cells from subjects who had ST/PPT positive and Af-negative results (p less than 0.01 and less than 0.01), indicating prior in vivo activation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1989,2522977,no
Detection of beta-galactofuranosidase production by Penicillium and Aspergillus species using 4-nitrophenyl beta-D-galactofuranoside.,"An assay was developed for detecting beta-galactofuranosidase produced by Penicillium and Aspergillus spp. The substrate for the assay, 4-nitrophenyl beta-D-galactofuranoside, was synthesized from penta-O-acetyl-beta-D-galactofuranose and 4-nitrophenol by a tin chloride catalyzed reaction followed by O-deacetylation. Aspergillus spp. produced only small quantities of beta-galactofuranosidase during 30 d at 25 degrees C. Only the biverticillate Penicillium spp. (P. funiculosum, P. islandicum, P. rubrum and P. tardum) produced substantial beta-galactofuranosidase after 1-4 weeks at 25 degrees C. No extracellular antigens of these four Penicillium spp. could be detected in culture filtrates by the sandwich ELISA technique when antibodies to the extracellular beta-galactofuranoside-containing polysaccharide antigen of P. digitatum was used. Antigens to all other Penicillium and Aspergillus spp. were easily detected in their culture filtrates.",1989,2502527,no
Serological techniques for diagnosis of fungal infection.,"This review summarizes recent developments in the serodiagnosis of candidiasis, aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, mucormycosis and sporotrichosis. A number of studies have substantiated the presence of circulating antigens in invasive candidiasis, invasive aspergillosis, disseminated histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis, and immunoassays for antigen detection provide moderate sensitivity but high specificity for disease. Improved detection may result mainly from repeated serum or concentrated urine samplings rather than from the development of more sensitive immunoassays. Immunoblot analysis of the serological response is a useful tool for the identification of immunogenic fungal components that elicit a specific antibody response in invasive disease. This method, and others, have been successfully applied to the study of the immune response to several fungi, including Candida, Aspergillus and Rhizopus.",1989,2497015,no
Immunoblot fingerprinting Aspergillus fumigatus.,A new technique for typing Aspergillus fumigatus is presented. This is based on immunoblot fingerprinting each isolate against a rabbit hyperimmune antiserum raised against A. fumigatus NCTC 2109. All isolates were typable and reproducibility for the 16 antigenic bands which formed the basis of the system was excellent. Discrimination was better than silver staining and revealed 11 types among the 21 isolates from eight patients with an aspergilloma. Each aspergilloma could be due to either a single or multiple types.,1989,2466902,no
Production and characterization of murine monoclonal antibodies to Histoplasma capsulatum yeast cell antigens.,"Four monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were produced by immunizing mice with a disrupted yeast cell homogenate of Histoplasma capsulatum. MAbs 1 and 2 reacted only with the yeast cell antigens of H. capsulatum and Blastomyces dermatitidis, whereas MAbs 3 and 4 showed broader cross-reactivity. MAb 3 cross-reacted with B. dermatitidis, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Sporothrix schenckii, and Candida albicans, and MAb 4 cross-reacted with B. dermatitidis, C. albicans, Coccidioides immitis, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. All four MAbs exhibited unique specificity when reacted with three different strains of H. capsulatum (G217B, A811, and P-IN). MAb 1 belonged to the IgG2b subclass, MAb 3 belonged to the IgG1 subclass, and MAbs 2 and 4 belonged to the IgG3 subclass. MAbs 1, 2, and 3 formed bands in the Western immunoblot assay the two dominant distinct bands had apparent molecular masses of 72 and 62 kilodaltons.",1989,2917790,no
Diagnostic problems in hypersensitivity lung disease.,"Hypersensitivity Lung Disease (HLD) includes Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (HP), IgE triggered asthma and Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA). HP and ABPA are neither common nor rare. Both are important to diagnose as they can result in progressive irreversible lung damage. Serologic tests are useful in diagnosing or excluding HP and ABPA although the diagnostic skill of the physician is of prime importance. We report eight cases which were diagnostic problems in which the initial serologic examinations were incorrect. The diagnostician must be aware of both the clinical possibility of the HLD but also of the possibility or probability that the serologic report is not correct.",1989,2500384,no
Efficacy of immunoprecipitation methods for rapid serodiagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"The relative efficacy of Ouchterlony's double diffusion (ODD), Wadsworth's gel diffusion (WGD) and counter-immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) is reported for serodiagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). Of the 50 sera taken from patients with confirmed or suspected ABPA, serum precipitins were demonstrated against Aspergillus fumigatus by CIE, WGD and ODD in sera from 34, 31 and 25 patients, respectively. The results were negative by the three methods in sera taken from 10 healthy volunteers.

Production and characterization of antibodies cross-reactive with major aflatoxins.,"Antibodies cross-reactive with 4 major aflatoxins were demonstrated three weeks after immunization of rabbits with an immunogen which was prepared by conjugating aflatoxin B3 to bovine serum albumin. Aflatoxin B3 was first converted to its hemisuccinate before conjugation to the protein. Tritiated aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) was used as the marker ligand both for antibody titer determination as well as for analysis of antibody specificity. Competitive RIA revealed that the antibodies have good cross-reactivity with aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2 when tritiated AFB1 was used as the marker ligand. The concentrations causing 50% inhibition of binding of 3H-AFB1 to the antibodies by unlabeled aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, G2 and B3 were found to be 0.25, 3.34, 0.32, 4.0 and 0.53 ng/assay, respectively. The antibodies could be used for simultaneous analysis of aflatoxins B1 and G1, two of the most important toxic metabolites produced by Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus.",1989,2493390,no
[Using anti-sera and monoclonal antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus to study its cross-reactions with Alternaria alteria and Penicillium sp].,"Using rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus, we analyzed their cross-reaction with Alternaria alteria and Penicillium sp. by enzyme immuno assay (EIA) and radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP). It was found that neither of these two categories of antibodies reacted with Alternaria alteria while both reacted with Penicillium sp.. When components from Penicillium sp. precipitated by rabbit antisera were analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), a wide range of bands with molecular weights larger than 90 K and a single 70 K band were observed. No band was found after the rabbit antisera was adsorbed with Aspergillus fumigatus. Moreover, two monoclonal antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus cross-reacted with high molecular weight (greater than 200K) components of Penicillium sp.. These results suggest that the antigen of Alternaria alteria is different from that of Aspergillus fumigatus, and that Penicillium sp. and Aspergillus fumigatus share some antigenic components. In another experiment, human allergic sera containing IgE antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus were tested against Penicillium sp. by RIP. No cross-reaction was observed. This suggests that in spite of sharing common antigenic components between these two fungi, the allergenic components of Aspergillus fumigatus is different from those of Penicillium sp..",1989,2670140,no
[Prevalence of bronchopulmonary aspergillosis at the pulmonological hospital].,"The prevalence and the character of aspergillous infection were studied among 64 patients (33 men and 31 women) seen at the pulmonological hospital. Ten patients of that group were diagnosed to have bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. In all the cases, the disease was regarded as secondary one: 2 patients suffered from chronic aspergillous pneumonia and 8 patients from different patterns of aspergillous bronchitis. The risk factors of the disease development are described. The data obtained indicate that secondary bronchopulmonary aspergillosis occurs not infrequently. The estimation of the risk factors, careful clinical examination, and specific mycologic and serologic tests allow an early diagnosis of bronchopulmonary aspergillosis followed by institution of adequate treatment.",1989,2741129,no
[Serological diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis by ELISA].,"Pulmonary aspergillosis usually develops on the basis of systemic immunosuppression and/or local impairments of respiratory system. Diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis has many difficulties. Chest X-ray findings of most cases are complicated with pre-existing changes due to the underlying diseases, and the detection rate of the pathogenic fungi from clinical specimens is unsatisfactorily low. Therefore, immunological or serological diagnosis is urgently required and precipitation-in-gel method has been widely applied. In this report, we compared clinical usefulness of the determination of anti-aspergillus antibodies by ELISA with that of precipitation-in-gel method. ELISA was carried out according to the method previously reported by us (Yamamoto S. et al.: Kekkaku 62: 549, 1987). About two-thirds of 45 healthy adults (control) did not show any detectable IgG anti-aspergillus antibody and mean of IgG anti-aspergillus antibody titer of the control group was 28.97. Patients, who had shown positive culture of fungus or was clinically diagnosed or strongly suspected as pulmonary aspergillosis, showed significantly high anti-aspergillus IgG antibody titer in comparison with the control group. Further, patients who were positive in precipitation-in-gel tests showed significantly higher IgG antibody titers than those who were negative in that test. IgG antibody titer determined by ELISA corresponded with clinical diagnosis much more exactly than the results of precipitation-in-gel test. Further, the results obtained by ELISA were objective and quantitative in comparison with the latter test. We concluded that ELISA was much superior to precipitation-in-gel test and that ELISA IgG antibody titers 2500 or more were confirmative and those between 570 and 2500 were strongly suggestive for the diagnosis of aspergillosis. IgM anti-aspergillus antibody titers were not different among healthy control group and patient groups, and could not be used for the diagnosis.",1989,2709653,no
"Inhalant allergy in asthmatic children: skin prick test, radioallergosorbent test and chemiluminescent assay compared with allergen levels in their mattress dusts.","Mattress dusts from the beds of 51 asthmatic children with positive skin tests to house dust mite were assayed for Der p I, Fel d I and certain viable fungi. The results of skin tests to grass, cat, dog, Alternaria, Aspergillus, Cladosporium and Penicillium, radioallergosorbent tests to cat, mite, dog and grass and the chemiluminescent assay were compared and correlations made with allergen concentrations in the dust. The sensitivity of the three tests appeared comparable (percentage agreement = 54.5-94), however, an increased level of allergen in the mattress dust was not a good indicator of the degree of sensitization of the child (p greater than 0.05).",1989,2707882,no
Murine monoclonal antibodies binding to the specific antigens of Aspergillus fumigatus associated with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"Four murine monoclonal antibodies, which were produced against Aspergillus fumigatus antigens using hybridoma technology, reacted with different antigenic components of A. fumigatus, and in turn these antigens showed reactivity with the sera from allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). All four antibodies were of IgM isotype. These antibodies reacted against eight antigen preparations from three different strains of A. fumigatus by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Only two of four antibodies reacted with the antigens in crossed immunoelectrophoresis (CIE), rocket immunoelectrophoresis, and agar gel double diffusion. In western blot analysis it was found that the antigenic components reacting with the monoclonal antibodies were mostly of the low molecular weight components of A. fumigatus antigens. These components also showed binding to both IgG and IgE antibodies in the sera of ABPA patients, but failed to show any reactivity with sera from aspergilloma patients. Hence these antigenic components may be of diagnostic significance and can be isolated using immunoaffinity chromatography.",1989,2659757,no
Surveillance tests for the diagnosis of invasive fungal infections in bone marrow transplant recipients.,"A system for serial surveillance cultures and serological tests for diagnosis of disseminated fungal infections (FI) was evaluated retrospectively in 14 bone marrow transplantation (BMT) patients with autopsy proven FI (11 with Candida albicans and 3 with Aspergillus fumigatus) and 14 control BMT patients without FI. The 2 groups did not differ with regard to clinical features. Serial cultures for candida from various sites were more often positive in the FI group than in the controls (p less than 0.001). Consistently negative cultures were never seen in the FI patients (p less than 0.05). Positive conventional blood cultures or cultures of specimens from bronchoscopy were suggestive of FI before death in 6/14 of the patients with FI. No blood cultures were positive among the controls. Sequential serum samples taken before death in 7 patients with systemic candidiasis, 3 with invasive aspergillosis, and 12 control patients, were tested retrospectively for diagnostic candida and aspergillus antibody titers and free circulating candida mannan. The serological tests gave evidence of FI in 9/10 patients with FI and in half of the controls (p less than 0.05). In 8/10 cases with FI, serological tests became positive before a positive blood culture or a clinical suspicion of FI. With a prevalence of 7.5% of FI at our clinic, the predictive values for positive and negative was 100% and 97% for the antigenemia test and 14% and 100% for the ELISA test for IgA antibody against C. albicans mannan. Our data suggest that a rational use of surveillance cultures and serological tests may aid in an earlier diagnosis of FI in BMT patients.",1989,2658023,no
Characterization of immunologically important antigens and allergens of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Using a variety of immunochemical methods, including quantitative immuno-electrophoretic techniques, combined with gel filtration and iso-electric focusing, and production of monospecific antisera for identification and affinity purification, 4 major components of Aspergillus fumigatus have now been partially characterized. Numbering of these was derived from a reference allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) self-crossed radio-immuno-electrophoresis pattern of reactivity. Two major intracellular/cytoplasmic, concanavalin A (Con A)-binding antigens, Ag 7 and Ag 13, of molecular weights 150-200 and 70 kilodaltons (kD), respectively, were confirmed to be of importance for both ABPA and aspergilloma in specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. A rapidly released component, Ag 5, of molecular weight 35 kD, proved both antigenic and allergenic, with aspergilloma patients having especially high-titre IgG antibodies. The major allergenic component Ag 3, of molecular weight 24 kD by gel filtration and 18 kD by SDS-PAGE was, like Ag 5, relatively heat-labile and non-Con-A-binding. Interestingly, T cell clones have been identified which respond primarily to an 18-kD fraction.",1989,2651315,no
Immunologic analysis of steroid-dependent asthma.,"In order to analyze steroid-dependent asthma immunologically, IgE antibodies to mite (Dermatophagoides farinae), Candida albicans, and Aspergillus fumigatus were measured in 112 asthmatic patients. IgG and IgG subclass antibodies to mite were also measured. The rate of patients who were positive to candida IgE RAST was higher in atopic steroid-dependent patients than in atopic steroid-independent patients (P less than .01). The rate of mite-sensitive patients who had not received immunotherapy with mite or house dust was higher than in the atopic steroid-dependent patients than in atopic steroid-independent patients (P less than .05). IgG1 and IgG4 antibodies to mite were higher in mite-sensitive steroid-independent patients than in mite-sensitive steroid-dependent patients. IgE antibodies to A. fumigatus were detected only in patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). Based on these results, we were encouraged to try immunotherapy with house dust mite or C. albicans if patients were steroid-dependent and sensitive to these allergens except when the patients had ABPA.",1989,2643370,no
Studies on the osmophilic fungus Wallemia sebi as an allergen evaluated by skin prick test and radioallergosorbent test.,"Recently, Wallemia sebi, a species of osmophilic fungi, has been abundantly detected in house dust using low water activity media. In this study, allergenic activity of W. sebi was assessed by skin prick test and radioallergosorbent test (RAST) in 74 asthmatic patients ranging from 6 to 32 years of age. Aspergillus fumigatus and house dust were used for comparison. In skin prick test, W. sebi extract, A. fumigatus extract and house dust extract elicited positive reactions in 4 (5.4%), 4 (5.4%) and 51 (68.9%) patients, respectively. RAST showed positive results in 14 subjects (18.9%) for W. sebi extract, in 8 (10.8%) for A. fumigatus extract and in 59 (79.7%) for house dust extract. These results indicated that some asthmatic individuals showed immediate-type hypersensitivity to W. sebi, and which means this fungal species may be of importance to atopic diseases as a causative agent.",1989,2613343,no
Prevalence of antibodies to aspergilli in bronchial asthmatics.,"Sputum and bleed samples were analysed from 330 cases of bronchial asthmatics and 50 normal persons without features of bronchial asthma. The prevalence of aspergilli and antibodies to different Aspergillus species were detected using cultural methods and serological technique like agar gel double diffusion (DD), counter-immuno-electrophoresis (CIEP) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Out of total 6.06% yielded Aspergillus species in sputum specimens repeatedly. Precipitins against Aspergillus species were detected in 7.88% of cases by DD and CIEP. ELISA test showed 20% of cases to be having antibodies to A. fumigatus. Allergic broncho-pulmonary aspergillosis can be detected in the early course of the disease in bronchial asthmatics using highly sensitive technique like ELISA.",1989,2585333,no
Prevalence of basidiospore allergy in the Pacific Northwest.,"Mold spore-induced respiratory allergy has been incompletely studied, and only a limited number of Fungi Imperfecti are well established as aeroallergens. Basidiomycetes, a complex and common group of fungi, which include mushrooms, rusts, smuts, brackets, and puffballs, have not been well studied. Although basidiospores can be present in high atmospheric concentrations, little is known of their aeroallergen potential. To examine this question, we performed skin prick and RASTs in 33 adult residents of Washington State using a panel of 15 common inhalant allergents that included four Fungi Imperfecti and 15 basidiospore extracts. Thirty-one of 33 (94%) subjects had positive immediate reactions to two or more common inhalants. Nine of 33 (27%) subjects responded to at least one Fungi Imperfecti reactions were most common to Aspergillus sp. (21%), and least common to Penicillium sp., which were positive in 6%. Positive responses to basidiospore extracts were observed in 10 of 33 (30%) subjects. The prevalence of basidiospore reactivity was similar to that of Fungi Imperfecti, ranging from 18% for Scleroderma sp. to 6% for four different spore extracts. These results demonstrate that a significant number of subjects with respiratory allergies have skin test reactivity to basidiospore extracts, suggesting that these spores could be important aeroallergens in the Pacific Northwest.",1988,3204251,no
"Pathologic, hematologic, and serologic changes in rabbits given T-2 mycotoxin orally and exposed to aerosols of Aspergillus fumigatus conidia.","The influence of immunosuppression by T-2 mycotoxin on the fungal disease aspergillosis was investigated in rabbits. Four groups of rabbits (groups 1A, 1B, 3A, and 3B) were given 0.5 mg of T-2 toxin/kg of body weight/day, PO in addition, rabbits of groups 3A and 3B were exposed to aerosols of Aspergillus fumigatus conidia from days 7 through 16. Rabbits of groups 2A and 2B were exposed to A fumigatus aerosols, but were not given T-2 toxin, and rabbits of group 0 served as controls. Two rabbits of group 1A, 1 rabbit of group 1B, and 1 rabbit of group 3A died before scheduled necropsy. Rabbits of groups 1A, 2A, and 3A were killed and necropsied on day 17, and the remaining rabbits (groups 0, 1B, 2B, and 3B) were killed and necropsied on day 28. Changes caused by T-2 toxin included leukopenia, marginal anemia, and increased number of and morphologic changes in nucleated erythrocytes by day 21, followed by a regenerative hematologic response. Serum alkaline phosphatase and sorbitol dehydrogenase activities and antibody response to A fumigatus (as measured by an indirect hemagglutination test) were decreased by T-2 toxin ingestion. Rabbits with aspergillosis had leukocytosis, increased PCV, and increased antibody response to A fumigatus. Histologic lesions consisting of centrilobular hepatocellular swelling, portal and periportal fibrosis, and lymphocyte necrosis and/or depletion within secondary lymphoid tissue were observed in most rabbits treated with T-2 toxin. Normal defense mechanisms against A fumigatus infection were compromised by T-2 treatment, as evidenced by the severity and extent of lung lesions, greater number of hyphal elements observed, and greater number of colonies of A fumigatus isolated from rabbits of groups 3A and 3B. There were no significant changes in group-0 rabbits.",1988,3071196,no
Systemic fungal infections: diagnosis and treatment. I. Blastomycosis.,"Blastomycosis is a rare systemic fungal infection caused by Blastomyces dermatitidis, which is often difficult to diagnose because of its spectrum of manifestations, varying severity, and unusual occurrence in most geographic areas. Because routine serologic methods and skin tests are not reliable for this pathogen, diagnosis is made by visualization of the organism in tissue, sputum, or exudate, or by culture. Once blastomycosis is diagnosed, therapeutic options include treatment with amphotericin B or ketoconazole, or simple observation if spontaneous resolution is anticipated. The purpose of this discussion is to review the features of blastomycosis that relate to the clinical practice of medicine.",1988,3062092,no
Demonstration of antigenemia in patients with invasive aspergillosis by biotin-streptavidin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.,"A biotin-streptavidin (B-SA) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was designated for the detection of Aspergillus carbohydrate antigens in serum. The sensitivity of the assay was considered to be the lowest concentration showing an absorbance above the mean of the pooled serum samples from normal adults (mean + SD = 0.118 + 0.018) plus 3 SD. This value was 1.6 ng/ml for the ELISA. The upper limit of negativity was determined by adding 0.055 to the absorbance of pooled serum samples from normal adults. The maximum absorbance value in 18 patients with invasive aspergillosis as proven by autopsy was 0.271 + 0.087 (mean + SD). Sixteen patients with invasive aspergillosis showed antigen levels ranging from 2.0 to 17.0 ng/ml. Among 14 patients from whom serum samples were sequentially obtained, 11 showed a progressive increase in concentration in accord with the progression of the infection. Only one serum sample from 42 normal subjects (0.101 + 0.025) showed false positivity for antigens. On the other hand, serum samples from 23 patients with other fungal infections (0.109 + 0.021), 48 hospitalized patients without infections (0.103 + 0.022), and 42 patients with bacterial sepsis (0.117 + 0.022) were negative for antigens. It was found that the sensitivity and specificity were 89% and 99%, respectively.",1988,3171354,no
Leukotriene C4 generation from human eosinophils stimulated with IgG-Aspergillus fumigatus antigen immune complexes.,"Sepharose beads coated with IgG stimulate eosinophils to produce leukotriene C4 (LTC4). This observation has been extended with specific immobilized IgG/antigen immune complexes to elicit mediator generation. An extract of Aspergillus fumigatus was covalently coupled to Sepharose beads and incubated with the IgG fraction of immune serum from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. These beads elicited generation of 7.72 +/- 1.7 pmol of LTC4 immunoreactive material (n = 5) from 1 X 10(6) normal eosinophils of greater than 86% purity, and significantly less LTC4 (0.73 +/- 0.19 pmol per 10(6) cells n = 3) was produced by eosinophils after incubation with beads treated with IgG from normal nonimmune serum. The maximum antibody-dependent release achieved represented approximately 20% of that induced by the calcium ionophore (A23187). LTC4 was measured by radioimmunoassay and validated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The amount of LTC4 generated was dependent on the concentration of A. fumigatus-specific IgG, and mediator release was completely abolished by prior adsorption of the IgG fraction onto Sepharose-protein A (Staphylococcus aureus). Grass pollen-specific IgG antibody/antigen complexes, in combination with Sepharose beads, also triggered generation of LTC4 immunoreactive material. There was no evidence to suggest that IgE/A. fumigatus immune complexes triggered LTC4 generation, although IgE myeloma protein, in association with Sepharose beads, was a weak stimulus. The efficacy of the IgG immune complex-dependent stimulation of eosinophils suggests a possible physiologic mechanism whereby these cells could participate in the inflammatory changes associated with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and similar allergic disorders.",1988,3139729,no
Immunomodulation by Candida albicans: crucial role of organ colonization and chronic infection with an attenuated agerminative strain of C. albicans for establishment of anti-infectious protection.,"Intravenous inoculation of an attenuated agerminative strain of Candida albicans (PCA-2) of low virulence, but not of two other species of Candida of low virulence (C. parapsilosis and C. viswanathii) into CD2F1 mice conferred protection against the highly virulent microbes C. albicans CA-6, Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus fumigatus. To provide protection, a definite inoculum size (10(6) cells per mouse) resulting in organ colonization and establishment of a long-lasting chronic infection with PCA-2 was needed. An inoculum of 10(5) cells gave rise to transient kidney colonization whereas inocula greater than 10(6) cells led to acute septicaemia and eventual death. Chronic infection of mice following inoculation of 10(6) PCA-2 cells was accompanied by detectable mannoprotein antigen levels in the serum (30-70 ng ml-1) while specific antibodies did not appear until 14 d after inoculation, at which time low antimannan antibody was present (ELISA titre 1:40-1:80). Chronic infection was characterized by the presence in the kidneys of 2-3 x 10(6) c.f.u. of PCA-2 for at least 40 d after inoculation. Pharmacological modulation of the host through administration of either an anti-Candida drug, amphotericin B, or an immunosuppressive agent, cyclophosphamide, strongly supported the premise that the anti-infectious state conferred by PCA-2 'immunization' correlated with the maintenance of a sufficient number of PCA-2 in vivo. Protection was 'switched on' when 2-3 x 10(5) cells were present in the kidneys. It was maximal at a kidney count of 2-3 x 10(6) c.f.u. of PCA-2, and promptly declined when the number of PCA-2 cells in the kidney fell below 2 x 10(5). Mice chronically infected with PCA-2 had splenic macrophages with pronounced candidacidal activity in vitro. Modulation of the growth of PCA-2 in vivo, which determined activation or deactivation of the protective state, was paralleled by a similar modulation in macrophage activation, showing that in all cases resistance to virulent organisms persisted as long as macrophage activation was present. The results demonstrate that a critical in vivo antigenic load is crucial for the occurrence of resistance to infection and suggests that macrophages could be involved in this protection.",1988,3076189,no
Diagnosis of pulmonary infections in immunocompromised patients.,"In an immunocompromised patient with fever and pulmonary infiltrates, it frequently is difficult to decide which invasive procedure, if any, to use to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Because most lung infiltrates in immunosuppressed patients are caused by bacteria and sputum usually is readily available for examination, empiric therapy with potent, safe, broad spectrum, antibacterial drugs often is successful. Invasive procedures that prove a diagnosis may result in substantive changes in therapy in perhaps as few as 10 to 20 per cent of patients, and the procedure itself may harm the patient. In a unique study in which patients with acute pneumonitis without neutropenia were randomized to either empiric antibiotic treatment or treatment based on results of open lung biopsy, patients with open lung biopsy had a worse outcome, possibly related to morbidity of open lung biopsy. Furthermore, no diagnoses were provided by open lung biopsy that were not treated by the empiric regimen. A missed treatable disease may be tragic, however. A thoughtful clinician must evaluate each patient with careful consideration of the history in light of the underlying disease and its treatment, rapidity of clinical course, physical examination, and laboratory data, particularly the chest radiograph, sputum examination, and bleeding parameters. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with washings and brushings is very safe the addition of transbronchial biopsy adds diagnostic power at the price of some complications. Bronchoalveolar lavage is a very promising technique that probably will find widespread use. However, none of the foregoing techniques is completely sensitive. When no diagnosis is established and bronchoscopy studies are negative, open lung biopsy must be considered, especially when the chest radiograph or computed tomography scan suggests focal disease or lymphadenopathy. Needle aspiration can be used, particularly if local experience is favorable and lung disease is peripheral. When evaluating a procedure, local experience must be considered rather than reliance on published diagnostic yields and complication rates. New diagnostic and therapeutic developments may change decision analysis in the near future. At present, cultures for viruses and fungi and serologic techniques have little application at most medical centers, and decisions on data from invasive procedures pivot on interpretation of histology and smears. Development of assays for antigen (for example, Aspergillus) and rapid culture techniques (for example, cytomegalovirus and the shell vial method), coupled with new, effective antimicrobials, may demand maximum effort for a definitive diagnosis in every patient.",1988,3045451,no
Role of cAMP in the mediation of glucose catabolite repression of glucoamylase synthesis in Aspergillus awamori.,Exogenous cAMP was shown to mimic glucose in its effect on the synthesis of glucoamylase in Aspergillus awamori. cAMP (4 mM) when added to the starch medium blocked the derepression of glucoamylase by inhibiting its protein synthesis by about twofold. The repressive effect of cAMP on the glucoamylase synthesis was found to be due to twofold reduction in the glucoamylase specific mRNA levels. This cAMP related repression of the glucoamylase mRNA levels was most likely brought about at the level of gene transcription as cAMP had no apparent effect on the processing or stability of glucoamylase mRNA.,1988,2848632,no
IgG antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus in cystic fibrosis: a laboratory correlate of disease activity.,"Serum was collected from 50 patients with cystic fibrosis, and IgG antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, total IgE and Aspergillus specific IgE antibodies were measured in 41 of the 50. A close association was found between pulmonary function and clinical state, and IgG antibodies to Aspergillus. There was no association between pulmonary function or clinical state and IgE antibodies. It is postulated that in patients with cystic fibrosis, Aspergillus fumigatus may contribute to deterioration in pulmonary function by local pathogenicity, or by hypersensitivity mechanisms mediated by IgG.",1988,3046514,no
Effect of immunosuppression and amphotericin B on Aspergillus antigenemia in an experimental model.,"A modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for crude carbohydrate antigen was used to evaluate the kinetics of aspergillus antigenemia and to determine the effect of therapy on circulating antigen levels in an experimental model. The ELISA was rapid, simple to perform, and able to detect less than 10 ng of antigen/mL of serum. The model was also used to evaluate the effect of temporary and persistent immunosuppression on experimental disease. Antigen levels rose progressively in untreated control rabbits all 15 animals had significant antigenemia. Treated animals had markedly reduced antigen levels, but nine of 13 rabbits had detectable antigen after 72 h of therapy, a result that correlated with persistent disease. Therapy begun 24 h after challenge in temporarily immunosuppressed animals was more likely to sterilize tissues than was therapy begun 48 h after challenge. Therapy in persistently immunosuppressed rabbits was less effective and may require improved antifungal regimens to be successful.",1988,3042878,no
Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis: divergent responses of antigen-specific antibodies and total IgE.,"Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in eight patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) at a time when chest roentgeongraphy did not reveal an infiltrate, and respiratory status was stable. BAL was tolerated well by all patients with only one patient experiencing mild wheezing. BAL fluid recovery averaged 40%, and total cells/lavage were 22.3 x 10(6) (range 3.5 to 49.5 x 10(6)). Cell viability, as determined by trypan blue exclusion, averaged 48% (range 34% to 60%). Mean values for cellular elements were macrophages, 62% epithelial cells, 12%",1988,3042837,no
Immune responses to Aspergillus in cystic fibrosis.,"Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) is well recognized in its ability to colonize the respiratory tract in cystic fibrosis (CF). Furthermore, a number of the immune responses of the patient with CF to this organism have been characterized, and the immune inflammatory response to Af may result in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). This study evaluated a series of immunologic parameters in 75 patients with CF in order to characterize more fully the spectrum of immune responses of those patients to Af and to clarify the relationship of those responses to the clinical features of ABPA. The patients could be classified into four groups, depending on the clinical and immunologic findings. Eight (10.7%) of the 75 patients had clinical and laboratory evidence of ABPA, including immediate cutaneous reactivity to Af, eosinophilia, elevated total serum IgE, elevated serum IgE-Af or IgG-Af, and precipitating antibody to Af. Ten (13.3%) patients had these features, except that the total serum IgE level was within the normal range. Forty (53.5%) of the patients had no significant criteria for ABPA but had varying immunologic responses to Af, such as immediate cutaneous reactivity to Af in 25 patients and elevated serum IgE-Af and/or IgG-Af in 19 patients. Seventeen (22.7%) patients had no evidence of an immunologic response, as determined by skin testing and serologic assays. The study demonstrated that the response of patients with CF to Af ranges from clinically apparent ABPA to a possible variant of ABPA, to a nondiagnostic group of features consistent with sensitization to Af or to no characteristic immune response.",1988,3392373,no
Aspergillus fumigatus fungus ball in hospitalized patients with chronic pulmonary disease. Usefulness of double immunodiffusion test as a screening procedure.,"Double immunodiffusion (DID) was used as a screening test for the diagnosis of aspergillosis. Three hundred and fifty patients were tested, all of them referred from a specialized chest disease hospital and without a definitive etiological diagnosis. When DID was positive additional information such as clinical history and radiographic findings were requested and also surgical specimens were obtained whenever possible. Specific precipitin bands for Aspergillus fumigatus antigen were found in 29 (8.3%) of 350 patients sera. Nineteen (65.5%) of the 29 patients with positive serology were recognized as having a fungus ball by X-rays signs in 17 or by pathological examination in 2 or by both in 8 patients. This two-year prospective study has shown that pulmonary aspergillosis is a considerable problem among patients admitted to a Chest Diseases Hospital, especially in those with pulmonary cavities or bronchiectasis.",1988,3152275,no
Dot-immunobinding assay in the detection of IgG antibodies against farmer's lung antigens.,"Circulating antibodies against Faenia rectivirgula, Thermoactinomyces candidus, T. vulgaris and Aspergillus fumigatus were studied in the sera of 14 clinically proven farmer's lung patients and 10 normal controls using three immunological methods. These methods were agar gel double diffusion (DD), biotin-avidin-linked immunosorbent assay (BALISA) and dot-immunobinding assay (DIBA). Agar gel diffusion, the least sensitive of the three methods, failed to detect antibodies in some of the patients, while BALISA detected antibodies even in the normal controls. However, the sensitivity of dot-immunobinding assay was in between DD and BALISA while the specificity was comparable to DD to all the antibodies except against A. fumigatus antigens. Dot-immunobinding assay gave faster results than DD and the blots can be stored as record for longer periods of time without fading.",1988,3140016,no
Analysis of UK sera for aflatoxin by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.,"1. Aflatoxins are toxic, carcinogenic secondary fungal metabolites produced by certain moulds that commonly infest foods. Measurement of aflatoxins in human serum would give a direct measurement of exposure. 2. Twenty-seven serum samples from UK blood donors were found to contain aflatoxin levels not greater than 64 pmol/l (20 pg/ml) by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 3. These findings may indicate that present UK guideline tolerances for aflatoxin in imported food are effective in limiting human exposure to toxic aflatoxins in the UK diet, though further work would be needed to confirm this. In particular, sub-populations suspected of being at higher risk may need special considerations.",1988,3137153,no
The application of immunoperoxidase staining for the detection of causative fungi in tissue specimens of mycosis I.,"This study was performed in order to identify the fungi of four species (Aspergillus fumigatus, Fusarium anthophilum, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans) in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections by the indirect method of immunoperoxidase staining. Mature albino rabbits were immunized by formalin-killed organisms. The antibodies were prepared by precipitation at a 50% saturation of ammonium sulfate and were checked for cross-reactivities by Ouchterlony's double immunodiffusion and precipitin test. The immunoperoxidase staining was applied to the paraffin-embedded tissue sections of infected mice, human autopsy and biopsy specimens. Although each fungus was stained clearly the cell wall, cross-reactivities appeared among them, however it was possible to identify four fungi by absorption and dilution of the antisera.",1988,2457159,no
A pathologic study of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"A lung biopsy specimen was obtained from a 10-year-old boy with cystic fibrosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Light microscopy revealed a marked inflammatory process that was largely bronchocentric. Infiltrating cells included lymphocytes, plasma cells, monocytes, and numerous eosinophils. Elastin layers were intact in blood vessels and markedly disrupted in bronchioles. By immunofluorescent, major basic protein was demonstrated in eosinophils, was freely deposited outside of eosinophils, especially in the interlobular septum, and was taken up by macrophages. A number of lymphocytes stained positively for IgE. Through an immunoperoxidase stain, septate hyphae of Aspergillus were clearly observed in the lung parenchyma. A significant increase in interleukin-2 positive-staining T cells was observed with an approximate 2:1 ratio of helper to suppressor cells. The use of newer immunohistologic techniques has enabled us to gain additional insights into the pathogenesis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.",1988,3281999,no

Monoclonal glucose-oxidase-anti-glucose-oxidase (GAG) immunosandwich assay for the detection of monoclonal antibodies on routine hematological smears.,"A murine monoclonal antibody specific for aspergillus niger glucose oxidase has been prepared and used in an unlabeled antibody bridge technique for the detection of monoclonal antibodies. This procedure--the monoclonal glucose oxidase anti-glucose oxidase (GAG) immunosandwich assay--provides excellent immunocytochemical labeling of routine hematological films in combination with optimal preservation of cellular details. In contrast to conventional immunofluorescence procedures, routine hematological films can be used, and these can be stored before and after the immunolabeling. Compared with other immunoenzyme techniques such as those using alkaline phosphatase or peroxidase, the GAG assay is as sensitive and has the advantage that no problems with endogenous enzyme activity are encountered. The availability of alcohol-resistant disclosing reagents allows for routine hematological counterstaining which provides a very clear visualization of both the immunoreaction and the individual morphology of the blood cells.",1988,3281728,no
Partial characterization of a rapidly released antigenic/allergenic component (Ag 5) of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"An antigenic component of Aspergillus fumigatus, which was responsible for inducing an initial early antibody response in rabbits immunized with A. fumigatus germlings, has been identified and partially characterized. By immunofluorescent antibody and ELISA techniques, this antigen was demonstrated to be present on the germling surface, although it was also detected in supernatants of conidia/germlings within 1 hour and was present in all shake and stationary culture-filtrate extracts. By incorporation of a monospecific antiserum to this component in an intermediate gel of the reference self-crossed radioimmunoelectrophoresis pattern for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis sera, it was recognized as Ag 5 and was also demonstrated to bind specific IgE. Further immunochemical analyses have revealed that Ag 5 is relatively heat labile, does not bind to concanavalin A, and has a molecular weight of approximately 35 kd. This rapidly released antigenic/allergenic component may play an important role in the initiation of immunologic responses in patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.",1988,3279096,no
Humoral immunity in disseminated Aspergillus terreus infection in the dog.,"Aspects of humoral immunity were studied in 17 dogs with disseminated aspergillosis (16 cases Aspergillus terreus, 1 case Aspergillus flavipes). All dogs had markedly raised serum IgG levels by single radial immunodiffusion (range 1500-6000 mg dl-1). Despite this, serum antibody to A. terreus was demonstrated in only 7/16 cases by agar gel diffusion, 9/16 cases by counter immunoelectrophoresis, 10/16 by ELISA and 11/16 by an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Serum antibody was also detected in 2/5 clinically normal relatives of 2 cases, indicating previous exposure or subclinical infection.",1988,3131949,no
Woodman's disease: hypersensitivity pneumonitis from cutting live trees.,"A 28-year-old man developed multiple episodes of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and leukocytosis several hours after cutting live oak and maple trees. Fungal cultures of wood chips from oak and maple trees were positive for Penicillium (three species), Paecilomyces sp., Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus sp., and Rhizopus sp. Gel-immunodiffusion studies demonstrated serum precipitins to extracts of oak chips, Penicillium sp., and Paecilomyces sp., and suggested that Penicillium sp. and Paecilomyces sp. shared cross-reactive antigens that were the significant antigens in the oak chips. ELISA studies demonstrated elevated serum levels of IgG to an oak chip extract, inhibition of that ELISA by preincubation of serum with Penicillium sp., and absence of elevated IgG levels to an extract of freshly cut oak wood that had been stripped of bark to minimize mold contamination. The case analysis indicates that the patient likely had hypersensitivity pneumonitis on exposure to Penicillium sp., when he was cutting trees, and identifies cutting live trees as another occupational exposure that may cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis.",1988,3123541,no
Immunohistochemical identification of Trichosporon beigelii in histologic section by immunoperoxidase method.,"An indirect immunoperoxidase method capable of identifying an opportunistic fungus, Trichosporon beigelii, in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue has been developed. The authors studied autopsy materials from 19 patients with various fungal infections, including 3 patients with disseminated T. beigelii infection, 8 patients with localized or systemic candidiasis, 4 patients with invasive aspergillosis, 2 patients with pulmonary mucormycosis, and 2 patients with systemic cryptococcosis. T. beigelii could be successfully visualized in tissue sections from all three patients with this infection and a patient with systemic candidiasis who was found to have concomitant infection by T. beigelii. The capsule of Cryptococcus neoformans was also stained, indicating the presence of cross-reactive antigen between T. beigelii and C. neoformans. C. neoformans-absorbed antiserum was reactive with T. beigelii but not with other fungi, including C. neoformans.",1988,3276138,no
"Detection of antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus: comparison between double immunodiffusion, ELISA and immunoblot analysis.","The performance of ELISA to detect IgG and IgM antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus has been evaluated in strongly precipitin-positive, weakly precipitin-positive and precipitin-negative patient sera, with immunoblot analysis as the confirmatory test. All strongly precipitin-positive sera contained increased IgG titers and showed clearly positive immunoblot patterns. Most of the weakly precipitin-positive sera contained ELISA titers within the normal range established with sera of healthy blood donors and showed normal immunoblot patterns. Increased titers of IgG and/or IgM were measured in one-sixth of the precipitin-negative patient sera. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the presence of antibodies to A. fumigatus in 55% of the precipitin-negative sera with increased antibody titers. ELISAs for A. fumigatus-specific IgG and IgM are sensitive tests for screening of patient sera. However, positive results with ELISA should be confirmed by means of immunoblot analysis.",1988,3123399,no
Production and characterization of a murine monoclonal antibody to Aspergillus fumigatus antigen having IgG- and IgE-binding activity.,"By employing hybridoma technology, a monoclonal antibody against Aspergillus fumigatus was produced. This antibody, isotyped as IgM k, reacted with 12 of 16 antigens extracted from 9 different A. fumigatus strains. This antibody also reacted with all 3 Aspergillus flavus antigens studied, but not with Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus terreus, Penicillium notatum or Candida albicans antigens. Western blot analysis indicated that this antibody reacted with two concanavalin A (Con-A) binding bands of the A. fumigatus antigen extract. The specific binding antigens were isolated using monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography. When used in immunoassay this fraction demonstrated strong IgG and IgE antibody-binding activities against patient sera. The antibody levels against the purified fraction were significantly higher in patients' sera than in normal controls. The purified fraction demonstrated comparable reactivity with the crude A. fumigatus extract against patient sera, but the former has the added advantage of being pure and standardizable for dependable and reproducible results.",1988,3045013,no
Distinction of cnxH cofactor gene-specified protomers with monoclonal antibodies to Aspergillus nitrate reductase.,"The nitrate reductase (NADPH) (EC 1.6.6.3) from Aspergillus nidulans is influenced directly by mutations in the structural gene (niaD) for the major subunit of the enzyme and indirectly by mutation in any of several molybdenum cofactor loci (cnx). The cnxE-14 and the cnxH-3 mutants have been noted to contain the enzyme in two distinct forms following induction with nitrate. With the cnxH-3 as a prototype cnxH mutant, 10 other cnxH were found to be devoid of the assembled (dimeric) form of the enzyme. Two monoclonal antibodies specific for the native enzyme of the wild type (biA-1) recognized an epitope on the enzyme from the cnxE-14 and cnxH-3 mutants that was common to both and another that was unique to the cnxH gene specified protomer. Another monoclonal antibody recognized an epitope that occurs only in the assembled dimerio form of the enzyme from the wild type or the cnxE-14 mutant. The experiments further substantiate the cnxH phenotype as one involving unassembled protomers of the nitrate reductase in Aspergillus.",1988,2454152,no
[Method of determining proteolytic activity by using a conjugate of bovine serum albumin with peroxidase].,"The authors propose a method for determination of proteolytic activity, based on the hydrolysis of peroxidase-labeled molecules of bovine serum albumin immobilized on the surface of polystyrene microassay plates with the subsequent determination of peroxidase activity on the carrier or in the solution. The optimum conditions for the sorption of the labeled substrate have been established. The method permits the determination of bacillary alkaline protease at a concentration of 01. microgram/ml within 45 minutes. The determination of four proteases has demonstrated that this method shows good correlation with the routine one (r = 0.98), but is more sensitive and less time- and labor-consuming.",1988,2452531,no
Allergic bronchopulmonary candidiasis: case report and suggested diagnostic criteria.,"A patient with an illness consistent with allergic bronchopulmonary candidiasis is described. The patient had asthma, atelectatic pulmonary infiltrates on three occasions, immediate cutaneous reactivity as low as 10(-7) (wt/vol) to Candida albicans extract, and precipitating antibody to this organism. C. albicans was the only organism cultured from two bronchial lavage specimens. Total serum IgE was elevated to 5745 ng/ml and decreased rapidly with corticosteroid therapy. Serologic studies were not consistent with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Serum IgE to C. albicans, measured by ELISA after adsorption of IgG from the serum samples by incubation with staphylococcal protein A, was found to be 575% to 650% above control values. The serum IgE antibody activity against Candida decreased with clinical improvement after corticosteroid therapy.",1987,3693760,no
Evaluation of a test to detect circulating Aspergillus fumigatus antigen in a survey of immunocompromised patients with proven or suspected invasive disease.,"An ELISA for the detection and measurement of Aspergillus antigenaemia has been developed and evaluated by examining sera submitted over a 12-month period from immunocompromised patients with a likelihood of invasive aspergillosis. Results from proven cases of invasive aspergillosis confirmed at post-mortem and specimens from individuals with suspected disease showed that tests on single serum samples were often negative. Multiple specimens from the same patient greatly increased the frequency of detection. Repeated monitoring of sera from a single patient showed wide fluctuations in antigen level, which was considered to be due partly to the medical regimen to which the patient was subject. Control sera from healthy laboratory personnel were consistently negative, but a number of 'at-risk' patients without other evidence of invasive aspergillosis sometimes had low amounts of antigen. Concentrations of Aspergillus antigen of 100 ng ml-1 or higher were considered to be strongly suggestive of fungal invasion.",1987,3325629,no
Biochemical and immunochemical analyses of detergent solubilized antigens from membrane vesicles of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"A membrane vesicle fraction isolated from exponentially growing Aspergillus fumigatus strain Ag 507 cultures was obtained by mechanical disruption of intact Aspergillus cells under specific osmotic conditions followed by a pH fractionation technique. Electron micrographs of the membrane vesicles indicated unit membrane structures free from cell wall material. High glucose-6-phosphatase and low lactate dehydrogenase activities verified the relative purity of the membrane vesicle fraction. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) patient and normal human sera were incubated with the membrane vesicle fraction followed by colloidal gold tagged rabbit antiserum to human IgG or IgE. Electron micrographs indicated ABPA patient sera possessed specific IgG and IgE antibodies to membranous components. The detergent octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside was used to extract membrane vesicle components (MC). The enzyme profile of MC compared with cell sap components (CS) showed differences in types of enzymes. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analyses of MC and CS detected components shared as well as unique to each fraction. In crossed immunoelectrophoresis using both rabbit antisera raised to MC and ABPA patient sera, 5 peaks were detected, while analysis of CS using rabbit antisera raised to CS produced 20 major peaks. Immunoelectrophoresis and double immunodiffusion data supported the crossed immunoelectrophoretic data: MC differed from CS. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicated high specific IgG and IgE antibody levels to MC in ABPA patient sera. Crossed immuno-affinoelectrophoresis with concanavalin A partially characterized the MC, which consist of components which have glycoprotein elements (i.e., containing alpha-D-glucose or alpha-D-mannose).",1987,3329002,no
Evaluation of commercial serologic test reagents for immunoidentification of medically important aspergilli.,"We evaluated commercial serodiagnostic test reagents from Greer Laboratories (GL), Lenoir, NC Immuno-mycologics, Inc. (IMI), Norman, OK",1987,3126020,no
Characterization of a second major antigen Ag 13 (antigen C) of Aspergillus fumigatus and investigation of its immunological reactivity.,"A second major antigen of Aspergillus fumigatus (Ag 13) has been identified and characterized as a 70 kD, heat-labile component which is able to bind to the lectin, concanavalin A. Ag 13 proved to be identical to the previously recognized C antigen, known to possess chymotryptic activity. A monospecific antiserum to Ag 13 has been affinity purified and used to develop a sandwich ELISA for measuring levels of Ag 13 specific IgG antibodies in patients' sera. Although all ABPA sera (25/25) had significantly raised levels, some aspergilloma sera (2/5) had only very low levels of the control sera, 10/10 fungal atopics were negative, but 5/12 farmer's lung sera had low but positive values of Ag 13 specific IgG, i.e. sensitivity 100%, specificity 80%. Ag 13 is therefore a diagnostically important component of A. fumigatus and the antigen-specific ELISA may be of importance for the improved detection of disease-specific antibodies.",1987,3319301,no
Chip pile workers and mould exposure. A preliminary clinical and hygienic survey.,"Chip pile workers are exposed to high concentrations of airborne mould spores. Few sporadic cases of allergic alveolitis have been reported in Finland. Eight non-smoking workers, six on chip piles and two on bark piles, were examined to study the immunological and clinical response to continuous mould spore exposure. The spore exposure ranged between 10(4) and 10(5) spores/m3. Three of the six chip pile workers had precipitating serum antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus. The three antibody-positive workers had a tendency to decreased total pulmonary diffusion capacity and vital capacity. Significant respiratory symptoms were not noted. Long-term spore exposure may include an occupational health risk to chip pile workers.",1987,3318540,no
Invasive aspergillosis diagnosed by immunohistochemistry with monoclonal and polyclonal reagents.,"Therapies differ for invasive infection due to the various filamentous fungi. However, histopathologic identification of Aspergillus, Pseudallescheria, Fusarium, Trichosporon, dematiacious Hyphomycetes, Candida, and Zygomycetes may be confused, and microbiologic isolation is often delayed. To improve diagnosis, we examined the utility of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to identify Aspergillus organisms by peroxidase immunohistochemical techniques. Tissues obtained from 68 infected patients were examined. Fungal antigen was detected in all 26 cases of aspergillosis by the monoclonal immunohistochemical test. Hyphae of Aspergillus organisms exhibited strong intracellular and cell wall staining, and extracellular localization was also observed. In contrast, negative tests were observed in tissues from five cases of infection with Pseudallescheria boydii, three with Trichosporon, three with Zygomycetes, six with Candida species, and one with Curvularia, from as well as 20 cases of nonfungal pneumonia. However, cross-reactivity to Coccidioides immitis spherules was noted in three cases. Staining of Candida was observed with the polyclonal antibody but not the monoclonal reagent. This is the first immunohistochemical demonstration of aspergillus antigen with a monoclonal reagent. The study indicates that the monoclonal immunohistochemical technique can distinguish Aspergillus species from other filamentous fungi and may facilitate the clinical diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.",1987,3308679,no
[Solid phase radioimmunoassay for the quantitative determination of antigen-specific IgG-antibodies in the serum of patients with farmer's lung].,"In this study we have investigated a number of technical aspects of a sensitive solid-phase radioimmunoassay (microtitre-plate RIA) for the quantitative determination of antigen-specific IgG antibodies in the sera of patients suffering from farmer's lung. Microtitre-plates were coated with antigens of Aspergillus fumigatus, Micropolyspora faeni, Aureobasidium pullulans, Alternaria tenuis, Thermoactinomyces vulgaris and hay. Optimal antigen concentration and serum dilution were determined, the temperature-dependence of the assay and the kinetics of the binding of antibodies and protein A were studied. A comparison between glutaraldehyde-activated and non-activated microtitre-plates showed that the RIA with activated microtitre-plates produces values approximately 10-times higher than those with non-activated plates. However, the use of activated plates did not significantly increase the ratio between patient and control values.",1987,3121779,no
Electrophoretic and serological analyses of cytoplasmic antigens from Aspergillus fumigatus during growth of conidia to mature mycelia.,"The changes of cytoplasmic components concomitant with conidium to mature mycelium growth of Aspergillus fumigatus strain Ag 507 were analysed by one- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE 2-DE). SDS-PAGE monitored molecular weight differences between components of cytosol preparations obtained from conidia and those through 96 h of mycelial growth. 2-DE analyses indicated that some components characteristic of mature cytosol begin to appear by 7 h. Cytoplasmic preparations absorbed with rabbit immunoglobulins raised to mature cytosol were analysed by 2-DE. Conidia cytosol components were not absorbed to a great degree, unlike those from later stages of mycelial growth, which indicates that cytosol components may be changed and/or synthesized de novo during growth of the fungus. Analysis of the cytosol preparations by fused rocket immunoelectrophoresis showed that some components are synthesized in different amounts at various times during growth: 3, 4, 7, 8, and 18 h of growth, components begin to appear that may be synthesized de novo. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with rabbit antiserum to mature cytosol and cytosol preparations obtained from conidia through 96 h of growth, indicated differences of molecular structures between the cytosol preparations. The anticytosol IgG and IgE titers of sera from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis were both elevated and fluctuated with each preparation. The specific IgG and IgE titers both appeared to be elevated with cytosol preparations obtained from 4, 5, 7, and 9 h of growth and highest against the 96 h preparation.",1987,3312558,no
Evaluation of enzyme immunoassay as a rapid screening test for histoplasmosis and blastomycosis.,"This study evaluates the usefulness of enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as a screening test for serum antibodies to Histoplasma capsulatum and Blastomycoses dermatitidis and compares the results using this assay with those using complement fixation (CF), immunodiffusion (ID), and radioimmunoassay (RIA), in 12 patients with active histoplasmosis, 12 with active blastomycosis, 28 with other acute or chronic lung diseases and 25 healthy blood donors from an endemic area EIA was as sensitive as RIA and more sensitive than CF and ID in the 24 patients with active fungal infections. The specificity of EIA was equal to that of the other serologic tests. We conclude that EIA is a useful screening test for serum antibodies to H. capsulatum and B. dermatitidis that avoids some of the problems associated with other sensitive assays such as RIA. A negative EIA result is evidence against invasive histoplasmosis or blastomycosis and suggests an alternative diagnosis.",1987,3113304,no
Serologic response to Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus in cystic fibrosis.,"In order to evaluate the role of fungi in patients with cystic fibrosis, we determined serum IgG antibodies against Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus using an indirect ELISA in patients with or without fungi in the sputum and in sera of healthy individuals. For both C. albicans and A. fumigatus the antibody levels were significantly higher in the CF groups than in the control group, regardless of whether these fungi could be isolated during the observation time or not. In contrast to A. fumigatus, we found that in the majority of cases antibody levels increase significantly with the isolation of C. albicans from sputum. Therefore, we conclude that one has to pay more attention to C. albicans in CF patients. One must also particularly reevaluate long-term antibiotic treatment and look for means to prevent fungal recolonization and reinfection.",1987,3312024,no
Structures of oligosaccharides on beta-galactosidase from Aspergillus oryzae.,"The carbohydrate portions of beta-galactosidase from Aspergillus oryzae were found to be composed of two types of sugar chains. They were released equally well with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, but were distinct in their chain length. The long sugar chains (fraction I), corresponding to 4% of the total carbohydrate chains, were composed of galactomannan-type oligosaccharides, which consisted of mannose, galactose, glucose, and glucosamine in the molar ratios of 30.0, 16.4, 1.4, and 2.1 per mol of aspartic acid, respectively. The short sugar chains (fraction II), corresponding to 96% of the total carbohydrate chains, consisted of mannose, galactose, glucose, and glucosamine in the molar ratios of 9.4, 0.6, 0.3, and 1.7 per mol of aspartic acid, respectively. Both types of sugar chains were fractionated into neutral and acidic subfractions. The neutral subfraction of fraction I (I-N), corresponding to 1% of the total carbohydrate chains, was very heterogeneous in length and was resistant to digestion with alpha-mannosidase and beta-galactosidase. The neutral subfraction of fraction II (II-N), corresponding to 91% of the total carbohydrate, was composed of a mixture of oligosaccharides with oligomanneoside chains (Mann GlcNAcol). The major components were similar to high mannose-type oligosaccharides of mammalian origin in their composition and size (n = 5-9). However, digestion of II-N with alpha 1,2-mannosidase produced considerable amounts of Man6GlcNAcol, an unusual product in the case of high mannose-type oligosaccharides of mammalian origin, in addition to the common one, Man5GlcNAcol.",1987,3117779,no
"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Model of bronchopulmonary disease with defined serologic, radiologic, pathologic and clinical findings from asthma to fatal destructive lung disease.","Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) complicates asthma and results in immunologic lung destruction. Respiratory failure or fatalities from end-stage fibrotic lung disease have occurred in patients in the third and fourth decades of life. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis may be confirmed in patients with varying severity of asthma from minimal to corticosteroid-dependent and has been reported to occur in approximately 10 percent of patients with cystic fibrosis. It has been documented in infants and children, the geriatric patient with asthma, in the presence of a normal chest roentgenogram, in the corticosteroid-dependent asthmatic patient, and on a familial basis. The pathogenesis of ABPA is unclear, but may be related to the array of immunologic abnormalities including: elevation of total serum IgE, not all of which is directed to Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) elevated serum IgE-Af, IgG-Af and IgA-Af",1987,3556066,no
Disseminated cutaneous Fusarium infection with vascular invasion in a leukemic patient.,"A 61-year-old male with leukemia manifested multiple cutaneous nodules on his whole body surface, subcutaneous nodules on his arms and a tongue tumor. Septate hyphae were observed microscopically in scrapings from the surfaces of the cutaneous lesions. Fusarium solani and F. anthophilum were isolated from scrapings from the several skin lesions. Histological examination revealed the presence of numerous septate hyphae in the lumina of vessels in the dermis. The fungal elements in the cutaneous tissues were suggested to be Fusarium by an immunoperoxidase method using a genus-specific anti-Fusarium antibody. Although no evidence of fungal infection was found in other organs by clinical examinations, F. solani and/or F. anthophilum were considered to have undergone hematogenous dissemination, because of the presence of thrombi containing abundant fungal elements in the skin lesion. The present case is a case of disseminated cutaneous Fusarium infection, in which fungal elements in skin tissue sections were immunohistochemically regarded as Fusarium, though fungus cultures from biopsied specimens were negative.",1987,3302198,no
Receptor-mediated clearance of Aspergillus galactomannan.,"The fate of radiolabeled Aspergillus fumigatus galactomannan was studied after intravenous injection into rabbits and rats. At 1 hr, the liver contained 35% of the injected dose in rabbits and 30% in rats. Excretion of galactomannan into the urine, measured in rabbits, was another major catabolic route and accounted for 35% of the dose by 24 hr. Immunization of rabbits increased hepatic uptake and decreased urinary excretion. Hepatic uptake in unimmunized rats could be decreased by Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan, alpha-methyl mannoside, and N-acetylglucosamine, known inhibitors of the macrophage mannose receptor. Autoradiography showed hepatic radiolabeled galactomannan to be concentrated in Kupffer cells, which express the mannosyl receptor for glycoproteins. Macrophage mannosyl receptors may constitute a general mechanism for clearing fungal mannans from the bloodstream.",1987,3549914,no
Circulating IgG antibodies against fungal and actinomycete antigens in the sera of farmer's lung patients from different countries.,"Sixty-nine farmer's lung patients and 28 normal controls from four countries (Finland, Switzerland, Canada and the United States) were investigated for antibody levels against 13 antigens commonly used for the screening panel for hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Of these antigens, eight were from the Medical College of Wisconsin (United States) and five were from the University of Kuopio (Finland). IgG antibodies against these antigens were studied in 97 sera using a sensitive biotin-avidin-linked enzyme immunoassay. The results indicate that the mean antibody titer against Micropolyspora faeni was highest in the United States (U.S.) followed by Finland. Both Finnish and U.S. antigens reacted almost identically against various groups of patients, although the degree of reactivity varied considerably. Higher antibody levels against Thermoactinomyces vulgaris were detected in Finnish patients than patients from other countries while patients from all four countries showed elevated levels of antibodies against T. candidus. This study demonstrates that antigens from identical species, irrespective of geographic origin, reacted similarly. However, variability between antigens of the same species was still considerably significant. Since the microbiological flora of moldy hay varies widely in different regions, the microbial species associated with the disease at a given geographical area has to be determined before selecting antigens for serological studies. The antigens currently used in various laboratories are crude preparations and need to be purified and standardized for dependable results. Until such antigens are available, all antigenic preparations used in the immunological evaluation of patients should be immunochemically characterized for their reproducibility and reliability although the ultimate goal should be to obtain standardized pure antigens for dependable immunodiagnosis of farmer's lung.",1987,3299100,no
Detection of galactomannan antigenemia by enzyme immunoassay in experimental invasive aspergillosis.,"A sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for galactomannan antigenemia that avoids the use of radioisotopes was devised. Three carbohydrate-rich antigenic fractions were purified from Aspergillus fumigatus 2085: a cold alkali extract (CA) from mycelium, an acetone-precipitated pyridine extract (APSK-66) from mycelium, and a methanol precipitate from culture filtrate. CA and APSK-66 were further purified by gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography, respectively. An acid hydrolysate of CA contained only mannose and galactose, as determined by gas-liquid chromatography. Rabbit antisera were raised against conidia, mycelia, and cell walls of A. fumigatus. By indirect EIA, the best immunoglobulin G response (1/8,000) was obtained against CA in rabbits immunized intravenously with cell walls. Antigenemia was detected by indirect EIA inhibition in heat-dissociated sera of four immunosuppressed rabbits that were infected intravenously but was absent in two uninfected controls. The circulating antigen was resistant to pronase, was adsorbed onto concanavalin A, and had a molecular size of 50 to 100 kilodaltons.",1987,3294887,no
Cross-reactivity between antigens of fungal extracts studied by RAST inhibition and immunoblot technique.,"We have used the RAST-inhibition technique in homologous and heterologous inhibitions of the Aspergillus fumigatus, Alternaria tenuis, and Cladosporium herbarum RAST assays followed by the immunoblot technique to assess the degree of shared allergenic determinants in these extracts. In the Aspergillus RAST, there was little or no inhibition with Cladosporium and Alternaria, but considerable cross-reactivity was found between Alternaria and Cladosporium. Inhibition by Alternaria of the Cladosporium RAST was found in a dose-dependent fashion in one serum, whereas all four sera in the Alternaria RAST were inhibited by Cladosporium in this fashion. Logit transformation of the Alternaria RAST-inhibition curves produced common slopes with Alternaria and Cladosporium in three of the four sera, indicating their immunologic identity. The immunoblot technique confirmed the degree of cross-reactivity found by RAST inhibition among the molds. This evidence of common allergenic determinants in these fungi could help to explain the observation that mold-allergic patients often have skin test reactions to several fungi.",1987,3549841,no
"Enzyme-linked immuno-filtration assay (ELIFA) for the detection of IgG, IgM, IgA and IgE antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus.","The enzyme-linked immuno-filtration assay (ELIFA) permits detection of serological precipitating systems preformed by immunoelectro-diffusion on cellulose acetate strips and simultaneous characterization of immunoglobulins G, M, A and E specific for antigens of Aspergillus fumigatus. We selected 36 sera from 9 patients who were followed up regularly and who suffered from aspergilloma (5 cases), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (2 cases), Aspergillus bronchitis and invasive aspergillosis (one case each). All of them possessed an IgG-reactive band with chymotrypsin activity. Four different IgE bands were found by ELIFA one of them was common to all the patients who had anti-A. fumigatus IgE (7 cases out of 9). The IgA and IgM antibodies found in 7 cases out of 9 were both recognized by the same antigenic component but these fractions were distinct from those reacting with the IgE.",1987,3110398,no
Cellular and humoral immune responses in experimental aspergillosis in mice.,"Invasive aspergillosis was established in a naive murine model. Both humoral and cellular aspects of the immunological mechanism responded to invasion. Circulating immune complexes containing IgG in the infected group of animals were detected by both the C1q and conglutinin solid phase assays. Attempts to identify these complexes as Aspergillus antigen-specific complexes were unsuccessful. Cellular responses, as measured by blastogenic activity and inhibition of migration of sensitized cells were significantly elevated in the infected group.",1987,2957876,no
Role of serodiagnostic tests and skin tests in the diagnosis of fungal disease.,"Serodiagnostic tests have a significant role in the diagnosis of a number of fungal infections.

Rapid diagnosis of candidiasis and aspergillosis.,"Published studies support the hypothesis that at least two antigens of Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis circulate in the bloodstream of patients with severe candidiasis. One antigen (probably mannan) is stable and the other (probably protein) is labile. The stabile antigen can rarely be detected without prior dissociation from antibody. Dissociation treatment destroys the labile antigen, leaving in doubt whether any is antibody bound. Dissociation steps have also been necessary for detection of Aspergillus fumigatus antigen in sera from patients with invasive aspergillosis. Concentrations of the stable antigens of both Candida and Aspergillus appear to be in the nanogram-per-milliliter range, generally lying at the limits of detection by conventional assays. Improvements in sensitivity and practicality are needed, but the tests are clearly promising.",1987,3296104,no
Fusarium solani: evidence for common antigenic/allergenic determinants with other Fungi Imperfecti.,"Aqueous extracts of Fusarium solani and other members of the Fungi Imperfecti were evaluated for the presence of common antigenic/allergenic determinants using skin-prick testing, radio-allergo-sorbent test (RAST) inhibition, and immunoelectrophoretic methods. Prevalence of skin reactivity in forty-four atopic individuals, tested with commercially available fungal extracts, ranged from 27.3% for Alternaria tenuis to 6.8% for Penicillium notatum. No specific patterns of reactivity emerged from statistical analyses of skin test data. In contrast, RAST inhibition demonstrated common allergenic determinants. P. notatum and Aspergillus glaucus inhibited F. solani RAST by 79% and 84%, respectively. This was supported by crossed line immunoelectrophoresis both P. notatum and A. glaucus had antigenic determinants in common with F. solani. Collectively, these studies suggest that F. solani, P. notatum, and A. glaucus have several common antigenic/allergenic determinants.",1987,2438068,no
Diagnostic specificity of a sandwich ELISA for Aspergillus-related diseases.,"A sandwich ELISA with specificity for a major antigen (Ag 7) of Aspergillus fumigatus has been compared with indirect ELISAs with use of crude antigenic (culture filtrate) extracts and found to have a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 92.3% for antibody detection in sera of patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and aspergilloma. In the Ag 7 ELISA, all sera from groups with ABPA (21) and aspergilloma (15) had positive titers, and mean values for both these groups were significantly higher (p less than 0.001) than control levels. By comparison, in the indirect ELISAs, most sera of patients with ABPA were positive the sensitivity was 81% to 90%, and the specificity was 87%. Sera from other disease groups including sera from 13 patients with farmer's lung, 16 with tuberculosis, and 10 individuals with positive prick test to either A. fumigatus or Alternaria alternata were also tested by both types of assay. Up to five of these sera elicited significant positive results in the indirect ELISA, and although two sera were also positive in the Ag 7-specific ELISA, these latter titers were both below the range of values for the sera from patients with ABPA. With the use of an IgG calibration curve, the sensitivity of the assay was determined as within the range of 1 to 10 microgram of specific IgG antibody per milliliter. The Ag 7-specific ELISA is therefore a highly specific, sensitive assay for antibody detection in Aspergillus-related diseases.",1987,3819216,no
Pulmonary infections in AIDS.,"Based on our experience, we would like to offer a few pragmatic suggestions for the practicing clinician. These recommendations are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The first encounter with most patients gives the impression of either a dramatic acute infection, usually in the lungs, central nervous system, or gastrointestinal tract (in this order of frequency), or that of a chronic wasting disease. The former is frequently superimposed on the latter. The exploration of AIDS risk factors and a few easily detectable physical signs are the most important clues to the correct clinical diagnosis. Once AIDS is suspected, an aggressive and rapid approach for diagnosis is justified. Selected individually for each patient, the most commonly successful tests include bronchoscopy with BAL and/or transbronchial lung biopsy bone marrow, lymph node, or liver biopsy with both microbiologic and pathologic processing of the material",1987,3545659,no
Infectious complications in heart transplant recipients receiving cyclosporine and corticosteroids.,"The rate of infectious complications differed significantly in two groups of heart transplant recipients who received different immunosuppressive regimens. Compared with patients who received conventional immunosuppression, patients treated with cyclosporine had a lower rate of infectious complications, and the contribution of infection to observed mortality was lower. Herpes simplex virus caused less morbidity and there were fewer active cytomegalovirus infections in seropositive recipients treated with cyclosporine. The incidence of bacterial pulmonary infections and associated bacteremia also decreased impressively. A decrease in nocardial infections was offset by a rise in those due to Legionella species. The frequency of aspergillosis was decreased by 54% in the cyclosporine-treated group, but half of these infections disseminated beyond the lung and such dissemination was always fatal. Infections with Pneumocystis carinii were significantly less common with cyclosporine-based immunosuppression. Screening serologic tests for toxoplasma should be done routinely and consideration given to prophylaxis in heart transplant recipients at high risk.",1987,3541723,no
"Serum IgE antibodies to Trichophyton in patients with urticaria, angioedema, asthma, and rhinitis: development of a radioallergosorbent test.","A series of patients was identified who demonstrated immediate positive skin tests to intradermal Trichophyton extract. These skin responses did not correlate with other fungal skin tests and were present both in atopic and nonatopic patients. The individuals demonstrating positive immediate skin tests included patients with urticaria, angioedema, asthma, and/or rhinitis, as well as five of 34 normal control subjects. Most skin test positive individuals had a history of local fungal infection and clinical signs suggestive of fungal infection. By use of Trichophyton tonsurans extract linked to Sepharose as the immunosorbent, it was possible to measure IgE antibodies in 26/30 sera from skin test positive individuals. With strongly positive sera, RAST bound up to 30% of the radiolabeled anti-IgE added. The results confirm that most skin test positive individuals have IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to Trichophyton. These observations support the older view that absorption of dermatophyte allergen through the skin should be considered as a possible cause of allergic disease.",1987,3805546,no
[Cerebral aspergillosis. Apropos of 4 cases].,"Four patients with aspergillosis of the central nervous system collected in less than two years are reported. Three patients had hematologic malignancies (acute myelogenous leukemia, Hodgkin's disease) and were treated with corticosteroids and chemotherapy. One patient received antimicrobial agents fort a post operative meningitis (after acoustic neuroma surgery). Analysis of these cases and review of literature available us to point out the increased frequency of invasive and cerebral aspergillosis particularly in immunocompromised hosts treated by cytotoxic drugs or broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. Diagnosis is very difficult because: --there are non specific radiologic features for aspergillus granuloma, abscess, aneurysm or meningitis, --blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures are invariably negative, --serologic tests have limited value in immunosuppressed patients (poor capacity to elaborate antibodies). Diagnosis can be made only by surgical biopsy who isolate fungal elements. However diagnosis in greatest cases is only made at autopsy. Treatment consist by antifungal drugs administered intravenously and surgery when it is possible. Prognosis of cerebral aspergillosis is very poor and mortality rate very high about 70%.",1987,3600944,no
[Nasosinusal aspergillosis. Apropos of 35 cases].,"Principal characteristics of clinical and paraclinical pictures of nasosinusal aspergillosis (NSA) in 35 patients are analyzed and allow distinction of three main types of this nasosinusal fungal lesion. Localized, non-invasive nasosinusal aspergillosis (NINSA) is frequently of dental origin and presents as a chronic maxillary sinusitis resistant to conventional treatment. Serology is negative or non-significant for Aspergillus and recovery is complete after surgery. Invasive nasosinusal aspergillosis (INSA) affects debilitated patients (diabetes, immunodepression, malignant blood disease...), and presents with bone destruction, extension to orbit, base of skull and intracranial region, following an acute or subacute course with positive serology for Aspergillus. Early, wide surgical eradication is combined with local and general antifungal therapy but prognosis is poor. Allergic nasosinusal aspergillosis (ANSA), of more recent description, combines chronic sinusitis with severe nasosinusal polyposis, and specific histologic and immunologic features. Its course is favorable with corticoid therapy but long-term results are unknown.",1987,3566045,no
Serodiagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in patients with hematologic malignancy: validation of the Aspergillus fumigatus antigen radioimmunoassay.,"Six hundred sixteen sera from 79 hematology patients admitted on 152 occasions were analyzed for validation of the Aspergillus fumigatus antigen radioimmunoassay (RIA). Invasive aspergillosis developed on 24 admissions of 22 patients. Maximal antigenic activity was significantly higher in patients with invasive aspergillosis than in controls (P less than .0005). At the level of antigenic activity selected as the cutoff value, the sensitivity of the RIA was 74%, the specificity 90%, the positive predictive value 82%, and the negative predictive value 85%. Antigen was detected before invasive aspergillosis was suspected during 30% of admissions and before pathological or even preliminary microbiological evidence for disease in 46%. In 17 (77%) of the 22 episodes of pulmonary aspergillosis, the RIA would have been the first positive diagnostic test for aspergillosis or would have confirmed a diagnosis established by other means. Overall, the test would have been of clinical usefulness in diagnosis, management, and prognosis in 80% of 16 fatal cases.",1987,3540137,no
Aspergillus fumigatus-specific antibodies in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and aspergilloma: evidence for a polyclonal antibody response.,"Patients with the Aspergillus-induced diseases allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), aspergilloma (fungus ball), and Aspergillus skin test-positive asthma were differentiated immunologically by radioimmunoassay based on their total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and Aspergillus fumigatus-specific IgE levels. In this study, a new, highly sensitive biotin-avidin-linked immunosorbent assay was used to evaluate A. fumigatus-specific antibodies of all immunoglobulin classes. Studied populations included 13 patients with ABPA, 12 with aspergilloma, 9 with Aspergillus skin test-positive asthma, and 9 normal individuals without asthma. A. fumigatus-specific antibodies of all classes were elevated in patients with ABPA, variably elevated in those with aspergilloma, and lowest in the other two groups. This assay demonstrated significantly higher specific IgE antibody levels in the ABPA group over those of the other groups, even with 1:1,000 dilutions of the sera. This study demonstrated that ABPA is a disease characterized by a polyclonal antibody response to Aspergillus antigen and not just a response to IgE and IgG antibody classes. The measurement of other antibody classes, particularly IgD and IgA, could enhance the immunodiagnosis of ABPA. The biotin-avidin-linked immunosorbent assay was found to be a highly sensitive assay that can be a clinically useful alternative to radioimmunoassay in the measurement of A. fumigatus-specific antibodies.",1987,3539998,no
Monoclonal antibody probes for the niaD specified subunit in the NADPH-nitrate reductase from Aspergillus nidulans.,"In Aspergillus nidulans, the nitrate assimilatory pathway is regulated by a variety of agents, one being the autogenous enzyme nitrate reductase. A major subunit of the enzyme which is specified by the niaD structural gene and is implicated in autogenous control exhibits both nitrate inducible diaphorase activity and ammonium repression. The former was used to test the extent to which alterations in the niaD specified protomer might affect its formation in selected niaD point and deletion mutants. Enzyme preparations from the wild type and mutant strains were compared on the basis of nitrate inducible co-activities and their reaction to specific monoclonal antibodies (MABS). Proteins in partially purified mycelial extracts were subjected to Western blot analyses with three MABs to functional native enzyme. Extracts of niaD point mutants exhibited nitrate induced co-activities which matched those of the wild type while those from deletion mutants were diminished or totally inactive. Nitrate reductase, from the wild type and specific cofactor mutants, shares an epitope common to both the monomeric and dimeric form in the case of one MAB, and exhibits epitopes unique to one or the other form in the case of the other two forms. Enzyme-antibody interaction occurs with or without inhibition of catalytic activity depending on the MAB involved.",1987,3323853,no
Pathogenetic and serological aspects of pulmonary aspergillosis.,"Af is an important pathogen of the bronchopulmonary system, and the clinical spectrum encompasses aspergilloma, CNPA, IPA, ABPA, bronchial asthma, and allergic alveolitis. Bronchial carriage may, however, not always be associated with pathological effects. The polymorphism of the aspergillus-related disorders seems mostly to depend upon the different responses of the hosts. This review considers the antigenic composition of Af and specific antibody responses in man in relation to the pathogenesis and diagnosis of the various forms of pulmonary aspergillosis. More than 200 macromolecular components have been listed for Af and more than 30 antigens found to react with human sera. Serum antibodies to Af are common in healthy subjects. Schønheyder and his associates (A-L) have shown that IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies in healthy subjects are directed towards antigens to which also patients with aspergillosis strongly react. With immunofluorescent staining these antigens were found to be associated with hyphal walls, and a MW 470,000 fraction from ruptured mycelium was most reactive in ELISA. The respiratory tract appears to be the major route for exposure since the humoral responses include IgA class antibodies, and sIgA antibodies are found in bronchial secretions. Moreover, IgG antibody levels to the MW 470,000 fraction correlate with occupational exposure and smoking habits. In patients with cystic fibrosis high IgG antibody levels to MW 470,000 and MW 25,000-50,000 antigen fractions were associated with the carriage of Af in the sputum. An individual patient's level of IgA antibodies to the MW 470,000 fraction was inversely related to the Af carrier rate, and this was also true for IgE dependent reactivity to Af antigens. These observations indicate that IgG antibodies to some antigens mirror the extent of antigenic exposure, whereas some IgA and IgE antibodies may play a protective role against bronchial colonization with Af. IgG antibody determinations by ELISA were found to provide a higher diagnostic efficacy in pulmonary aspergillosis than IgA antibody assays. With IgG antibodies there were statistically significant differences between patients and the controls and there was little overlap of ELISA values between the groups. The fractions of MW 250,000 with catalase activity and MW 25,000-50,000 with protease activity, were most suitable for serological diagnosis. A gel immunoelectrophoretic assay proved Af catalase to be a major diagnostic antigen in patients with aspergilloma or with an apical aspergillus lung infiltrate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1987,3321416,no
Botrytis cinerea: a study of the immunological properties during growth. Incidence of antibodies against B. cinerea in a group of patients with aspergillosis.,"When growing Botrytis cinerea in Sabouraud medium, different phases of growth could be recognized using pH, mycelium yield, and culture filtrate antigens as parameters of growth. Immunological characteristics of the different phases (early, intermediate, and late) of growth were measured using IgE and IgG binding by enzyme allergosorbent test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively, and quantities of precipitating components (double immunodiffusion and rocket immunoelectrophoresis). The number of precipitating components was maximal in culture filtrate extracts during late phase (III) of growth. In contrast, both IgE and IgG binding were already maximal in the early phase of growth (9 days of cultivation). In a group of patients with elevated IgE antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus, about half of them also showed elevated IgE antibodies against B. cinerea. This indicates that multiple exposition is a cause of multiple sensitization however, cross-reactivity in some of these sera cannot be excluded.",1987,3112026,no
Galactomannan antigenemia and antigenuria in aspergillosis: studies in patients and experimentally infected rabbits.,"Purified galactomannan (GM) from Aspergillus fumigatus was used in both a radioimmunoassay and an enzyme-linked immunoassay for antigen detection. Results of the two tests seemed interchangeable. By one or both assays, GM was detected in serum from four of 12 rabbits lethally infected with A. fumigatus in concentrations ranging from 108 to 356 ng/ml. Serum antigen was detected in only two of 12 patients with invasive aspergillosis. Results of assay for GM in urine were far more encouraging. Urinary GM was detectable throughout the course of lethal aspergillosis in all 16 rabbits, in concentrations of 24-1,900 ng/ml. Urine from seven of 13 patients with invasive aspergillosis had GM concentrations of 1-83 ng/ml. Antigen excretion roughly paralleled extent of disease.",1987,3098861,no
[Specific anti-cytomegalovirus immunoglobulins in the prevention of cytomegalovirus infections in bone marrow allografts].,"In order to assess the role of specific anti-CMV immunoglobulins in the prevention of severe cytomegalovirus infection in bone marrow transplant recipients, 46 consecutive patients were treated from day 1 to day 90 with injection of hyperimmune immunoglobulin with titres greater than 10,000 (ELISA) prepared from plasma selected for its high antibody titre (greater than 1,250). None of the patients developed CMV interstitial pneumonia 5 patients developed diffuse pneumonitis, 2 of the aspergillus type and 3 apparently idiopathic, which progressed to fibrosis. There were no deaths directly attributable to CMV infection. This study confirms the efficacy of high dose immunoglobulin therapy in the high risk period for the prevention of sever CMV infection. In the absence of effective antiviral therapy, it is important to use all measures of prevention in patients with bone marrow transplants. The double identification of seronegative and hyperimmune blood donors allows preparation of uncontaminated cell fractions (with respect to CMV) and the selection of hyperimmune plasmas for the preparation of specific immunoglobulins.",1987,2823667,no
Conditions that mimic inflammatory bowel disease. Diagnostic clues and potential pitfalls.,"Many of the features that identify idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease are also found with other colorectal conditions that are often encountered by the primary care physician. Although, initially, symptoms of these disorders may appear to be caused by ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, the cause could be bacterial, viral, parasitic, or fungal infection. Ischemic colitis and radiation colitis are other conditions that are similar in presentation to ulcerative colitis. In most cases, the physician should be able to make a differential diagnosis from a thorough history and physical examination, anoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, rectal biopsy, stool examination, and serology. An occasional patient, in whom diagnosis is not made by these methods, may require a barium enema study, colonoscopy, or referral to a gastroenterologist.",1986,3774662,no
Disseminated coccidioidomycosis in a patient with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome.,"Disseminated coccidioidomycosis is a recognized but infrequent accompaniment of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). A patient with AIDS, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and disseminated coccidioidomycosis occurring outside of an endemic area is described. Fungal infection presented atypically with progressive thoracic adenopathy and the development of cold soft tissue abscesses. As is often the case with AIDS, serologic testing proved to be unreliable and tissue biopsy the only means of accurate diagnosis.",1986,3490949,no
Prospective study on humoral immune response induced by fungal infection in patients with hematologic malignancies.,"To evaluate the immune response in an immunosuppressed population, antibodies against commercially available Candida albicans antigens were prospectively studied during 37 episodes of acute stomatitis caused by C. albicans and 36 episodes complicated by deep-seated mycoses in 62 adult patients with hematologic malignancies. During uncomplicated stomatitis in patients with acute leukemia, the mean peak IgM, IgG and IgA class enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) units differed significantly from the basic level preceding fungal infection. Mean time until peak values was 2.7-3.8 weeks after diagnosis of stomatitis. During systemic mycoses the antibody response was similar. Among patients with other hematologic malignancies, predominantly lymphomas, several were terminally ill and responded infrequently by antibody production. Similar results were given by Ouchterlony immunodiffusion and counterimmunoelectrophoresis. Thus, patients with acute leukemia showed an antibody response to fungal infection the peak values, however, were somewhat delayed.",1986,3102382,no
Significance of IgG antibodies against environmental microbial antigens in a farming population.,"A group of dairy farmers studied 6 years earlier in a field survey was re-surveyed for respiratory symptoms, occupational capability and the presence of antibodies against environmental micro-organisms. Specific IgG antibodies to Micropolyspora faeni, Thermoactinomyces vulgaris, Aspergillus umbrosus and Aspergillus fumigatus were measured by ELISA from the serum samples obtained in the two surveys. Antibody titres remained constant in 70% of both farmers and controls, but where changes took place, the titres against the actinomycete antigens tended to rise, whereas both increases and decreases were detected equally against the Aspergillus antigens. The titre of specific antibody to any of the four micro-organisms, when measured from a single serum specimen, seemed to be of little diagnostic value. Observed changes however, were more diagnostic, in that a fall in titre, especially against the Aspergillus antigens, was closely associated with a definite decrease in exposure, such as after retirement. Increased titres occurred in farmers with continued exposure, and those against the actinomycetes were associated with the appearance of symptoms in previously symptom-free individuals. In a case of farmer's lung which developed in this population during the follow-up period, significant increases were detectable against T. vulgaris and M. faeni.",1986,3779941,no
Potentiation of IgE production to common environmental allergens by storage house dust mite Dermatophagoides farinae.,"Total serum IgE and IgE antibodies against ten common antigens, including Dermatophagoides farinae (D.f.), moth, ragweed, orchard grass, cryptomeria, alternaria, aspergillus, dog dander, cat dander and tetanus toxoid, were determined using the PRIST and the Sepharose-RAST, respectively, in 100 clinically non-allergic Japanese subjects and interrelations of IgE responses to these antigens were investigated. We obtained following results. The number of positive RAST antigens, to which the subjects responded, increased in parallel to their total serum IgE levels. Among ten antigens, D.f. and moth antigens contributed a great deal to the elevation of total serum IgE level as compared with other antigens. When the relationship between IgE response to D.f. and similar responses to the other nine antigens was investigated, positive RAST responses to various antigens occurred selectively in the subjects with positive RAST for D.f., and the number of positive RAST antigens to which the subjects responded increased depending upon their D.f. specific RAST levels. Such an association was not found between IgE response to moth and the other nine antigens. These findings suggest that non-specific activation of IgE-producing B cells occurs as a result of continuing stimulation by D.f.",1986,3490933,no
Rapid diagnostic methods for aspergillosis.,"Conventional laboratory methods are always unsatisfactory for the antemortem diagnosis of systemic mycoses, especially aspergillosis, in immunocompromised patients and those with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), regardless of their age. There is increasing proof that aspergillosis is not limited to pulmonary, sinus or nasal regions. These facts, plus the high mortality rate, indicate a tremendous need for reliable and rapid methods of diagnosing this infection. Accordingly, refined techniques such as solid-phase radioimmunoassay (SPIRA), crossed-immunoelectrophoresis (CIE), crossed-radioimmunoelectrophoresis (CRIE), radioallergosorbent test (RAST), radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA), paper radioimmunosorbent test (PRIST), computerized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), biotin avidin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) are being considered or used in clinical laboratories for diagnosing aspergillosis. The advantages and limitations of the RIA, ELISA and GLC methods are briefly discussed.",1986,3765953,no
Detection of fungal antigen in body fluids for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.,"In clinical trials, the diagnostic utility of a radioimmunoassay (RIA) to detect Aspergillus antigen was demonstrated in sera obtained from patients with invasive pulmonary, endothelial, and disseminated aspergillosis, in cerebrospinal fluids from patients with Aspergillus meningoencephalitis, and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The RIA was further evaluated in three blinded, controlled clinical trials. In one, sera were collected prospectively from patients with acute leukemia. Antigenemia was detected in four patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) due to A. flavus, appeared early in the course of infection of three patients concurrent with the onset and evolution of lung infiltrates, and remitted with antifungal chemotherapy. Antigenemia was not detected in three patients before the onset of IPA, in eight leukemic controls, or in the 24 normals. In contrast, seven bronchoscopies were performed in five patients with IPA fungi were not isolated in three. In a second study, antigenemia was found in coded sera from two patients with invasive aspergillosis but not in eight controls. In the third controlled study, 616 sera from 79 hematology patients admitted on 152 occasions were analyzed for circulating fungal antigen. The diagnostic utility of the RIA was confirmed and levels of antigenemia correlated with the patients' clinical course. These studies demonstrate the utility of the Aspergillus antigen RIA for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in hospitalized high risk patients.",1986,3532635,no
Allergens of Aspergillus fumigatus: identification and characterization of components combining with specific IgE antibody.,"Aspergillus fumigatus-specific IgE antibodies, mediating immediate type hypersensitivity reactions are found in a proportion (16-26%) of patients with asthma and their presence is a criterion for diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). Sensitive radiolabelled or enzyme-linked immunoassays are required for detection/quantification of these antibodies in patient's serum, and the fungal components, allergens, to which they combine, may be identified in crossed radio-immunoelectrophoresis tests. Of the 40 or more components antigenic for rabbits, as many as 18 have been identified as allergenic, two as major allergens. One major allergen with a molecular weight of approximately 24,000 daltons, pI 4.5, has been partially characterized. Further, in ABPA patients whose sera also contain IgG antibodies, both classes of antibody can combine with the same components forming IgE/IgG antigen complexes in vitro.",1986,3532634,no
Aspergillus fumigatus antigens used in the serodiagnosis of aspergillosis.,"The diagnostic antigens in Aspergillus serology are mycelial or culture filtrate concentrates. Recent work has been directed towards the separation of defined, reproducible products of greater sensitivity and specificity than crude extracts. Conventional methods of separation have been used they include fractional precipitation, detergent extraction, chromatography, and preparative isoelectric focusing. Selective staining of the separated fractions has shown many of the more reactive components to be glycoproteins. Affinity binding to Concanavalin A has demonstrated the presence in these of alpha-D-glucopyranose, alpha-D-mannopyranose and/or terminal alpha-D-N-acetylglucosamine. Major amino acid constituents are serine and threonine, together with glutamic and aspartic acids. The more reactive and specific components, as judged by their antibody binding capacity, have molecular weights greater than 70,000",1986,3532633,no
Aspergillosis--clinical aspects.,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is much more common than originally suspected, can have its onset in childhood and remain undiagnosed for years or decades, at which time it presents in a patient with end-stage fibrotic lung disease. In other patients, ABPA may cause a finite number of roentgenographic lesions and not be associated with chronic sputum production or widespread bronchiectasis. Clinical symptoms range from the patient being asymptomatic with a new roentgenographic infiltrate being suspected only by a sharp elevation of total serum IgE to wheezing dyspnea or status asthmaticus. Serologic assays that are of major value in diagnosis of ABPA include elevation of total serum IgE--not all of which is directed against Aspergillus fumigatus, precipitating antibodies to A. fumigatus--unless the patient is in remission, and elevated serum IgE-A. fumigatus and IgG-A. fumigatus compared to serum from patients with asthma with immediate cutaneous reactivity to A. fumigatus but without evidence of ABPA. Five stages have been identified which reflect the time of recognition of ABPA and disease activity. They are Acute, Remission, Recurrent Exacerbation, Corticosteroid-Dependent Asthma, and Fibrotic. Stage I (Acute) patients have the classic clinical, serologic, and radiologic features of ABPA. Stage II (Remission) occurs after prednisone has resulted in resolution of the chest infiltrate and can be tapered and discontinued for 6 months without new infiltrates. Stage III (Exacerbation) occurs when a new roentgenographic infiltrate occurs associated with elevation of total serum IgE. Stage IV (Corticosteroid-Dependent Asthma) is present when repeated attempts to discontinue prednisone results in severe wheezing that cannot be prevented with other therapy. Some Stage IV patients continue to develop new ABPA infiltrates. Stage V (Fibrotic) patients have irreversible obstructive and restrictive pulmonary function abnormalities and may present or progress to respiratory failure and death.",1986,3532632,no
Development of a sandwich ELISA to detect IgG and IgG sub-class antibodies specific for a major antigen (Ag 7) of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"A sandwich ELISA has been developed, using an affinity purified monospecific antiserum as a capture antibody, to detect specific IgG and IgG sub-classes to a major antigen (Ag 7) of Aspergillus fumigatus in the sera of patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). Significantly elevated levels of specific IgG to Ag 7 were detected in 97% of ABPA sera tested, as compared to control sera and to sera from A. fumigatus skin-prick test positive individuals. IgG sub-class antibody levels to Ag 7 were also determined in a similar sandwich ELISA, but using specific monoclonal antisera instead of the polyclonal anti-IgG. Both Ag 7 specific IgG1 and IgG4 levels were found to be significantly raised in the ABPA sera compared to controls. It is proposed that this antigen-specific ELISA may provide a more specific diagnostic test for IgG antibody detection in sera of ABPA patients.",1986,3527473,no
Serum IgA antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus in various stages of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"With double antibody ELISA, serum IgA antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) were measured from patients in stages I through V allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). All sera from patients with ABPA demonstrated considerably greater values for IgA-Af than sera from nonatopic subjects. When this sera was compared with sera from patients with asthma and immediate cutaneous reactivity to Aspergillus, the present studies documented markedly elevated serum IgA-Af in the acute, exacerbation, and fibrotic stages of ABPA. Some patients in remission or corticosteroid-dependent asthma stages also demonstrated increased values. Because the major stimulus to antibody production occurs in the lung in response to presence of Af hyphae, polymeric IgA antibodies could potentially contribute to immunologic lung damage in ABPA. Finally, large dose alternate day or daily prednisone that was administered to patients in the fibrotic stage of ABPA did not prevent the marked production of isotypic antibodies to Af.",1986,3522709,no
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the detection of specific antibodies against Aspergillus in patient sera.,"A biotin-avidin linked enzyme immunoassay (BALISA) was used to detect Aspergillus fumigatus specific antibodies in the sera of patients with aspergillosis. Culture filtrate antigens from a strain of A. fumigatus grown in synthetic medium was used in the ELISA. This antigen was characterized by various immunochemical methods including isoelectric focusing, two-dimensional electrophoresis and antigen antibody crossed-immunoelectrophoresis. Sera from patients having allergic asthma, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), aspergilloma and normal controls were studied. High levels of IgE and IgG antibodies specific to A. fumigatus antigens were detected in ABPA while only IgG antibodies were seen in aspergilloma. The normal group and the allergic asthma failed to show any differences in the specific antibody content. Biotin-avidin linked immunosorbent assay was found to be very useful in detecting both IgG and IgE antibodies, and by using characterized antigens reproducible and dependable results can be obtained.",1986,3094289,no
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Natural history and classification of early disease by serologic and roentgenographic studies.,"Eighty-four patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) were evaluated for a total of 294 patient-years with a mean observation period of 3.7 years and classified by the stage of ABPA. The largest percentage of patients were in the stage IV (corticosteroid-dependent asthma stage) group. The next largest percentage were in the stage V (fibrotic, end-stage lung disease) group. Of the latter 24 patients, eight had died. In addition, we describe 13 patients with all serologic characteristics of ABPA but without central bronchiectasis. We propose that these patients have seropositive ABPA and represent the earliest cases of it that can be diagnosed in contrast with ABPA with central bronchiectasis in which lung damage is already present.",1986,3516103,no
Cross-reactive polysaccharides from Trypanosoma cruzi and fungi (especially Dactylium dendroides).,"Cross-reactivity between fungal and Trypanosoma cruzi polysaccharides, owing to common residues of beta-D-galactofuranose, beta-D-galactopyranose, and alpha-D-mannopyranose, was demonstrated by using rabbit immune sera against T. cruzi epimastigotes and sera from patients with Chagas' disease. Several chagasic (Ch) sera precipitated partly purified galactomannans from Aspergillus fumigatus and from T. cruzi epimastigotes and also the galactoglucomannan from Dactylium dendroides. Reaction of one Ch serum with T. cruzi galactomannan (GM) was completely inhibited by synthetic beta-D-Galf-(1----3)-Me alpha-D-Manp, and that of another Ch serum with a purified D. dendroides galactoglucomannan (GGM) was partly inhibited by (1----6)-linked (81%) or by (1----3)-linked (33%) beta-D-Galf-Me alpha-D-Manp. The beta-D-Galf-(1----3)-alpha-D-Manp epitope was present in both T. cruzi and D. dendroides polysaccharides. Rabbit anti-T. cruzi antisera precipitated A. fumigatus GM, T. cruzi antigenic extracts containing the lipopeptidophosphoglycan (LPPG), T. cruzi alkali-extracted GM, a synthetic GM, and D. dendroides GGM. Weak reactivities were obtained for a Torulopsis lactis-condensi GM containing beta-D-Galp terminal residues and for baker's yeast mannan with alpha-D-Manp-(1----3)-alpha-D-Manp-(1----2)-alpha-D-Manp+ ++-(1----2) side chains. An anti-LPPG rabbit serum precipitated D. dendroides GGM--a reaction inhibited (82%) by beta-D-Galf-(1----3)-Me alpha-D-Manp and. less efficiently, by a (1----5)-linked beta-D-Galf-tetrasaccharide. Sera from mice immunized with D. dendroides whole cells reacted with CL-strain trypomastigotes as shown by indirect immunofluorescence, by a Staphylococcus adherence test, but were not lytic.

Occupational asthma caused by cellulase.,"Inhalation of enzyme dusts can cause occupational asthma, and the list of enzymes able to induce asthma is increasing. We report two patients with asthma induced by occupational exposure to cellulase powder derived from Aspergillus niger. A type I hypersensitivity to this enzyme was demonstrated by means of skin test reactivity, positive passive transfer test, positive reverse enzyme immunoassay for specific IgE, and immediate bronchial provocation test response to cellulase dust. Skin tests with an A. niger extract were positive. Cross-reactivity between cellulase dust and an entire A. niger extract was also demonstrated.",1986,3958392,no
Histopathologic and antibody responses of rabbits exposed to aerosols containing spores of Aspergillus fumigatus: comparison of single and multiple exposures.,"Resistance to pulmonary aspergillosis was studied in groups of rabbits exposed to aerosolized spores of Aspergillus fumigatus for 15 minutes on successive days for a total of 10, 7, or 4 exposures or a single exposure. The results of the study demonstrated that exposure of rabbits to spores for 15 minutes on 10 successive days did not result in an accumulation of viable spores in excess of those present in the lungs of rabbits exposed a single time. The tissue response in the lungs of the rabbits exposed at multiple times was more intense than that in the rabbits exposed once, but resolution of the lesions occurred similarly in terms of time and completeness of resolution. The duration of the antibody response as determined by a passive hemagglutination test and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay correlated with the number of exposures to spores, in that rabbits exposed 10 or 7 times to aerosolized spores remained positive longer than did those exposed fewer times. The results of the precipitin tests in agar gel were negative in all the rabbits but one.",1986,3516034,no
Binding of C-reactive protein to Aspergillus fumigatus fractions.,"Calcium-dependent binding of C-reactive protein (CRP) to Aspergillus fumigatus was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A homogenate of young hyphae was fractionated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography followed by gel filtration. High CRP-binding activity was found in a fraction of mol. wt c. 500,000 which was characterised by strong binding to the hydrophobic column. Three fractions of less conspicuous CRP-binding activity were identified (c. 500 000, 150 000 and 150 000-50 000 mol. wt respectively). In these four fractions, phosphorylcholine was detected by an anti-phosphorylcholine mouse hybridoma antibody. Some CRP-binding activity in fractions with low affinity for the hydrophobic column did not correspond closely with the presence of phosphorylcholine. It is suggested that C-reactive substance in A. fumigatus is heterogeneous. The C-reactive substances did not correspond with fractions containing major antigens (470 000 and 250 000 mol. wt respectively) which elicit a strong immune response in man.",1986,3512843,no
Evaluation of cross-reactions in Histoplasma capsulatum serologic tests.,"Cross-reactivity in Histoplasma serologic tests was evaluated by using sera from patients with histoplasmosis and other infections. Serum samples from 127 of 134 (95%) patients with histoplasmosis were judged positive by complement fixation tests, and 121 (90%) showed H bands, M bands, or both by immunodiffusion. Of these 134 patients, cross-reactions were seen to Blastomyces dermatitidis in 53 patients (40%), to Coccidioides immitis in 20 patients (16%), and to Aspergillus fumigatus in 3 patients (2%) by complement fixation. Serum samples from 5 of 99 patients (5%) with other fungal infections and from 5 of 46 patients (11%) with tuberculosis had M precipitin bands by the Histoplasma immunodiffusion test, whereas none of the 123 sera from patients with other bacterial, Mycoplasma, or viral infections showed H or M precipitin bands. In the complement fixation test, positive reactions were observed in 16 of 90 patients (18%) with other fungal infections, in 14 of 41 patients (34%) with tuberculosis, and in 18 of 105 patients (17%) with other bacterial, Mycoplasma, or viral infections. Positive reactions were seen by radioimmunoassay in 54 of 110 patients (49%) with other fungal infections, in 23 of 46 patients (50%) with tuberculosis, and in 35 of 123 patients (28%) with with other bacterial, Mycoplasma, or viral infections. These results demonstrate a wider range of cross-reactions in Histoplasma serology than has been previously recognized, and the cross-reactivity was greatest when observed by radioimmunoassay. Caution should be exercised in the interpretation of serologic data from patients with suspected fungal infections.",1986,2420821,no
"Improved purification of Aspergillus oryzae 1,2-alpha-mannosidase by using mannan gel affinity chromatography.","In order to facilitate the purification of 1,2-alpha-mannosidase from an enzyme product of Aspergillus oryzae, we have devised a rapid and simple procedure. A partially purified enzyme preparation obtained from the A. oryzae enzyme product, by means of ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by CM-Sephadex C-50 chromatography, was subjected to affinity chromatography with baker's yeast mannan gel as an adsorbent. 1,2-alpha-Mannosidase was retarded and well separated from the major protein peak on the affinity column. After a second affinity chromatography under the same conditions, 1,2-alpha-mannosidase was finally purified 7,500-fold with a 22.9% yield. The enzyme preparation thus obtained was quite suitable for the structural analysis of glycoconjugates.",1986,3700367,no
RAST-specific IgE in Nigerian asthmatic patients.,"This first study of the pattern of allergen-specific IgE in Nigerian asthmatic patients in Zaria shows a significant percentage with specific IgE to Dermatophagoides pteronnyssinus, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Cynodon dactylon (Bermuda grass). Total serum IgE varied in both urban and rural asthmatics with a pattern of low and high levels in all groups.",1986,3484920,no
Occurrence of Aspergillus umbrosus antibodies in Danish farmers.,"Antibodies to Aspergillus umbrosus were investigated in 181 Danish farmers, 137 farmers' spouses and a control group of 104 male blood donors with no relation to farming. By enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) higher levels of IgG antibodies were found in farmers than in their spouses and in non-farming controls (P less than 0.0001). By double immunodiffusion precipitating antibodies occurred in 11 farmers, in none of farmers' spouses and in one control subject. Farmers and farmers' spouses who were non-smokers had higher IgG antibody levels than smokers in the same groups (P less than 0.04). Farmers more than 30 years of age had higher IgG antibody levels than younger farmers (P less than 0.04). Farmers rearing cattle tended to have higher IgG antibody levels than farmers without cattle. No correlation between antibody levels and respiratory symptoms or lung function parameters (FEV1 or FVC) could be demonstrated.",1986,3085531,no
An immunochemical study of Neurospora nucleases.,"Nucleases derived from Neurospora crassa mycelia with neutral single-strand (ss) endodeoxyribonuclease activity have been examined by immunochemical techniques and by sodium dodecyl sulfate - DNA gel electrophoresis. All of the intracellular nucleases, which have different divalent metal ion requirements, different strand specificities with single- and double-strand DNA, different modes of action on DNA and RNA, and other distinguishing characteristics, are immunochemically related to Neurospora endo-exonuclease. The evidence indicates that these enzymes are derived from one or more related large, inactive (precursor?) polypeptides that are first converted to 75- to 80-kdalton active polypeptide(s) which are very protease sensitive. Further limited proteolysis results in the production of the various active forms of nuclease studied here. Some proteolytic conversions may occur in a controlled manner in vivo in different cell compartments, but others are very likely artifacts resulting from uncontrolled proteolysis during extraction and isolation. The intracellular forms of Neurospora endo-exonuclease are immunologically cross-active with ss-DNA-binding nucleases isolated from Aspergillus nidulans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. They are not immunochemically related to two extracellular Neurospora nucleases, the pancreatic DNase-I-like DNase A and a ss-specific exonuclease, and they are also not related to other fungal and plant nucleases with ss-specific endonuclease activity such as the S1 nuclease of Aspergillus oryzae, the P1 nuclease of Penicillium citrinum, and mung bean nuclease.",1986,3013242,no
Immunological relationship of extra-cellular polysaccharide antigens produced by different mould species.,"Moulds are able to produce extracellular polysaccharide antigens which are heat-stable and almost genus specific. Of 44 different strains of Penicillium 41 (93%) and all 12 strains of Aspergillus tested produced detectable quantities of an immunologically related antigen. Additionally 10 of these 56 strains produced an antigen immunologically related to the antigen produced by the genera Mucor and Fusarium. Immunologically different, but genus-specific antigens were produced by each of the species belonging to the genus Geotrichum, Fusarium, Cladosporium, Mucor and Rhizopus. The antigens produced by Mucor and Rhizopus, however, were immunologically related.",1986,3789703,no
[Aspergillus pneumonia].,"Aspergilluspneumonia means a form of pulmonary aspergillus infection invading tissue and accidentally vessels of the lung. Because of lacking of typical clinical and roentgenological signs diagnose finding is realized by evidence of fungi (histology, culture, serology). From 87 aspergilloses 60 could staged as aspergillomas by the x-ray pictures. 27 cases were bronchiectases, carcinomas, bacterial pneumonias with aspergillus or pneumonias without other lung disorders and agents other than aspergillus. The difficulty to ensure the ""pure"" aspergilluspneumonia (invasive type) is pointed out, when histological proof is lacking. The therapeutical possibilities are discussed.",1986,3765706,no
Cerebellar aspergilloma.,"A cerebellar aspergilloma simulating brain tumour in a 48-year-old woman with alveolar proteinosis is described. The course of the disease was recurrent. Despite neurosurgery, ventricular drainage, amphotericin B, flucytosine and other antifungal agents, the disease was ultimately fatal. The diagnostic and therapeutic problems of aspergillosis in the central nervous system are discussed. Suspicion and serology might lead to early diagnosis and a better prognosis.",1986,3764353,no
"Class-specific antibody determination against Aspergillus fumigatus by means of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. III. Comparative study: IgG, IgA, IgM ELISA titers, precipitating antibodies and IgE binding after fractionation of the antigen.","IgG, IgA and IgM ELISA antibody titers against Aspergillus fumigatus were elevated in sera of patients with aspergilloma and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), showing higher titers for the IgG antibodies compared with the IgA and IgM antibodies. No differences were found between titers of identical antibody classes in the two groups of sera. IgG and IgA ELISA titers were highly specific whereas IgM ELISA showed more unspecific binding of IgM antibodies. Antibodies, as measured by ELISA, studied after fractionation of the antigen into fractions of decreasing molecular weight, showed a preferential binding by the high molecular weight fractions. Precipitating antibodies studied in patient sera did not always correspond with the IgG ELISA titers. IgE antibody binding was observed in all fractions from Sephadex G-100 fractionated components maximum binding was found with fractions of 28,000-60,000 daltons. The low molecular weight fractions (18,000-less than 5,000 daltons) showed less IgE binding but the quantity of this fraction was higher. The discrepancies noted between the IgG and IgA ELISA titers and the binding of IgM or IgE antibodies indicate that antigenic components may in part differ in the binding of antibody classes.",1986,3522437,no
A partially purified glycoprotein antigen from Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Culture filtrate antigens of Aspergillus fumigatus were fractionated by isoelectric focusing using a pH gradient of 4-6.5. Three fractions, namely, 18, 19 and 20 were pooled and subjected to immunochemical analysis. It contained a concanavalin A binding glycoprotein. Antibody raised against this component was used to prepare an affinity column of IgG-Sepharose and was used to purify crude culture filtrate antigens. This component produced three precipitin arcs in crossed immunoelectrophoresis using anti-A. fumigatus rabbit serum. This fraction has an isoelectric point of 6.5 and showed three components in two-dimensional electrophoresis with approximate molecular weights of 20, 40 and 80 kilo daltons. This antigen reacted with patient sera in the biotin-avidin linked immunosorbent assay and showed high levels of anti-A. fumigatus IgG and IgE antibodies in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and IgG antibodies in aspergilloma. Both controls and Aspergillus skin test positive asthmatics showed only low levels of specific antibodies. Because of the purity of this antigen, its potential use as a standardized antigen in the detection of antibody is discussed.",1986,2419255,no
Familial aggregation of IgG antibody response to antigens associated with farmer's lung.,"The levels of circulating IgG antibodies to Aspergillus umbrosus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Thermoactinomyces vulgaris, and Micropolyspora faeni were determined by enzyme immunoassay in 197 subjects selected for a study of farmer's lung (FL). The material consisted of five study groups: 37 patients with clinically confirmed FL, 31 spouses of the patients, 44 immediate relatives of the patients, 35 immediate relatives of the patients' spouses, and 50 unrelated people who were spouses of the 79 people in both relative groups. The mean titres of IgG antibodies to all four microbes were highest in patients with clinically established FL. In the other groups the mean titre of Aspergillus umbrosus, a mould found much more frequently in Finnish farm environments than other moulds under study, was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) in the relatives of FL patients than in other people. This finding remained irrespective of whether the subjects had suffered from FL symptoms or not or whether they worked or lived on the same farm as the patient or on a different one. The difference in the mean titre was not due to the differences between the study groups in age, sex, smoking habits, atopic background, frequency of handling of plant materials, or time interval from the most recent handling of visibly mouldy hay. The results imply that genetic factors may be important in the IgG antibody response to microbial antigens associated with FL.",1985,3910599,no
[Aspergillus infection and chronic septic granulomatosis].,"Chronic granulomatous disease of childhood is a hereditary abnormality of phagocytic cells, frequently associated with Aspergillus infections. From 1969 to 1984, 14 of 37 children with chronic granulomatous disease have presented with pulmonary (13 cases) and/or osteo-articular (1 case) aspergillosis. The paucity of symptoms was a characteristic of these infections. Lung lesions extending to the thoracic chest wall carried the bad prognosis. Neither the Aspergillus skin test nor the Aspergillus serology could definitely confirm the diagnosis. Only broncho-alveolar lavage and biopsy with isolation of Aspergillus could confirm the diagnosis. Long-term therapy with amphotericin B alone or associated with other antifungal agents is necessary. For the past 3 years, ketoconazole prophylaxis has been used in 23 children and none of these children has developed aspergillosis.",1985,3833108,no
Cultivation of fungi in synthetic and semi-synthetic liquid medium. II. Immunochemical properties of the antigenic and allergenic extracts.,"Four allergologically important fungi, viz. Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicillium notatum, Alternaria alternata, and Cladosporium herbarum were cultured in a liquid synthetic medium, with or without addition of 0.1% yeast extract (YE). After 10 and 28 days of cultivation, immunochemical properties of the fungal extracts, characterised by precipitation pattern and IgG- and IgE-binding capacity, were studied. In pure synthetic medium no large differences were observed in number of precipitates, as measured by DID, among the four antigenic fractions of each fungus (metabolic and mycelial antigens of both early and late phase cultures). Addition of YE to the growth medium hardly changed the number of precipitates and generally caused a decrease in IgG-binding capacity of the extracts. In contrast to these observations were the findings with the IgE-binding capacities of the fungal extracts as measured by RAST. Most allergenic fractions demonstrated an increase (sometimes strong) in IgE-binding capacity after YE was added to the growth medium. It is concluded that the time of cultivation influences the immunochemical characteristics of fungal extracts and that mycelial as well as metabolic antigens of both early and late phase cultures should be used in order to obtain a wide spectrum of allergens in extracts used for diagnostic purposes.",1985,3911818,no
Comparison of serial diagnostic tests in a patient with invasive aspergillosis.,"Studies on a liver transplant recipient with fatal disseminated aspergillosis are described. The concentration of IgG antibodies to Aspergillus rose sharply with the onset of fever and changes in the chest X-ray, reaching a peak on day 10. Thereafter, antibody concentrations fell and were within the normal range by day 21, when Aspergillus was first isolated from an endotracheal aspirate and one day before death. The fall in antibodies preceded a rise in circulating immune complexes but Aspergillus antigens were not detected in the serum. Serial quantitative assay for antibodies to Aspergillus may be more appropriate than culture or attempts to detect antigen in the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients.",1985,3910731,no
Immunoblot analysis of serological responses in invasive aspergillosis.,"The serological response to Aspergillus fumigatus was investigated in patients with pulmonary aspergillosis using the immunoblot technique. Antibody was detected against nine components of the fungus, ranging in molecular weight from 88 000 to 33 000 daltons. Antibody to a 40 000 dalton component was present in most patients (13 of 16). In surviving patients it was high (two with aspergilloma) or low but persistent (two with invasive aspergillosis). It was absent or fell in the 12 patients who died of invasive aspergillosis. Antibody to this 40 000 dalton antigen was not present in 10 sera from healthy controls. This antigen may form the basis of a more sensitive and specific serodiagnostic test for systemic aspergillosis.",1985,3905872,no
The diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for circulating antigen.,"An inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) capable of detecting 10 ng of aspergillus carbohydrate antigen/ml of serum was developed. When retrospectively applied to the sera of 19 patients with invasive aspergillosis, the ELISA detected antigen in 11 patients. None of 14 healthy controls or 28 patients with a variety of other infections were positive for circulating antigen. A rabbit model of invasive aspergillosis was also developed. Daily fungal cultures of blood were negative in the rabbits, as in human disease, but antigen was detected in increasing amounts up to the time of death. This ELISA is a sensitive, specific, and easily performed assay for circulating aspergillus antigen that should facilitate early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis, heretofore, seldom made without invasive tests.",1985,3900240,no
Infectious complications of neoplastic disease.,"Progress has been made in the diagnosis and treatment of infection in patients with neoplastic disease. Among the advances is the appreciation that certain opportunistic infections occur in association with particular host immune defects and epidemiologic factors. Such immune defects are seen secondary to or as a consequence of treatment for the patient's basic disease. Improved methods such as serology, open lung biopsy, and fiberoptic bronchoscopy have allowed for earlier diagnosis and treatment of opportunistic infections. The development of empiric antibiotic regimens, particularly aminoglycosides and the antipseudomonal penicillins, have improved the outcome in the febrile neutropenic patient. The benefits of protective environments have been challenged prophylactic antibiotics and various forms of immunotherapy are of interest but remain investigational.",1985,3877475,no
Effects of aflatoxin on young turkeys and broiler chickens.,"The effect of crude aflatoxin (AF) on the growth, performance, and immune response of turkeys and broilers was studied. Crude AF, produced from a natural outbreak of Aspergillus flavus on corn, was ground and mixed in rations to contain either 0, 100, 200, 400, or 800 ppb of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). Turkeys (Experiment 1) and broilers (Experiment 2) were used in identical experimental designs. In each, 200, 14-day-old birds were divided equally by sex into five groups of 40 and were fed one of five AF diets for 35 days. In Experiment 1, crude AF greater than or equal to 400 ppb was highly toxic to turkeys. These levels produced signs and lesions of aflatoxicosis as well as a significant decrease in weight gain and feed conversion during 5 weeks. In addition, microscopic lesions, indicative of aflatoxicosis, were evident as low as 100 ppb, and significant decreases in cell-mediated immunity were noted in the 200 ppb group birds. Experiment 2 indicated that chickens were less susceptible to crude AF than turkeys. Neither morbidity nor mortality occurred in broilers. Gross lesions consistent with AF toxicity were evident in birds given 800 ppb and microscopic lesions were observed in birds given 100 ppb. Feed conversion was significantly increased in the 800 ppb broilers only. Cell-mediated immunity, measured by a delayed hypersensitive skin test, was significantly decreased in broilers receiving AF at 200 ppb or greater. Neither humoral immunity nor the development of the acquired immunity to Newcastle disease or fowl cholera vaccination were decreased in turkeys or broilers given AF.",1985,4048060,no
IgG enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis: retrospective study over 15 years of transplant recipients.,"Four commercially available Aspergillus fumigatus antigens were compared in an IgG enzyme linked immunosorbent assay by testing multiple sera from 19 patients who had received renal and hepatic allografts and who had histologically confirmed invasive aspergillosis. Raised antibody levels were found in 16 of the 19 patients. More antibody responses were detected by culture filtrate antigens, but somatic antigens often detected antibodies sooner. When antibodies to Aspergillus antigens were present before transplantation the onset of fatal disseminated infection was earlier. Antibody levels often fell to within the normal range, even in cases of fulminant disseminated infection. Repeated serology was essential for detection of an antibody response.",1985,3900143,no
Serologic analysis of antigen-specific reactivity in patients with systemic candidiasis.,"Antibody responses to candidal polypeptides and mannans were studied in patients with systemic candidiasis, candiduria, and other fungal and bacterial infections, and in healthy laboratory personnel to determine the diagnostic value of these immunologic responses. When tested by immunoblot analysis, sera from 15 patients with systemic candidiasis frequently contained antibodies to three antigens: 15 of 15 sera from patients with invasive disease reacted to a molecular species having a molecular weight (Mr of 90-200 kd, 13 of 15 reacted with a 45-kd polypeptide, and 12 of 15 reacted with a 17-kd polypeptide. Lesser reactivity was observed in 11 of 15 sera with a 28-kd candidal antigen and in 9 of 15 to a 57-kd candidal antigen. Quantitation of antibody titers against the 45-kd candidal polypeptide demonstrated much higher immunoreactivity in patients with systemic candidiasis than in patients with superficial candidal infections, bacterial infections, other systemic mycoses, and healthy individuals. Antimannan antibody titers were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and these titers were also higher in patients with systemic candidiasis than in patients in the other categories. These differences, however, were less than those observed with the anti-45-kd polypeptide antibody. Therefore, the ability to detect systemic candidiasis is improved by testing sera for immunoreactivity to polypeptide and to mannan antigens from Candida albicans. Detection of polypeptide antibodies improves the serodiagnosis of systemic candidiasis.",1985,2411467,no
Application of ELISA-inhibition to Aspergillus antigen standardization for immunodiagnosis.,An inhibition ELISA method was used to test culture filtrate antigens of Aspergillus fumigatus for the avidity of antibodies to them.

Differences between antigens exhibiting similar crossed immunoelectrophoresis patterns were observed by inhibition ELISA.,1985,3901333,no
A familial occurrence of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis: a probable environmental source.,This is the first article of a familial occurrence of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in a father and daughter. Serologic studies revealed serum precipitins and elevated IgG or IgE antibody activity against certain Aspergillus species. Investigation of the home revealed an environmental source of exposure. Another family member demonstrated serum precipitins and an IgG antibody response to the isolated Aspergillus species without evidence of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,1985,4008814,no
[Immunodiagnosis of Aspergillus-induced bronchopulmonary diseases].,"Studies using the immunoblot technique were carried out to identify the components of Aspergillus fumigatus against which the IgE and IgG antibodies of 22 patients with Aspergillus-related lung diseases are directed. Asthmatics exhibit IgE antibodies against 2-6 of the fungus components and, surprisingly, an even more pronounced IgG antibody reaction. It was determined that persons suffering from allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis show massive IgE-and IgG-mediated sensitization, generally against more than 20 components. However, treatment with corticosteroids, which produces remarkable improvement in cases with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, is associated with very low amounts of specific IgE. Patients with farmer's lung disease and aspergilloma possess--with one exception--no specific IgE antibodies, but all have comparable spectra of specific IgG antibodies in the latter group the especially high antigenic activity of components with a molecular weight of about 18,000 daltons was noticeable. Healthy subjects display weak IgG antibody reactions with only a few Aspergillus antigens. These results show that more than 30 antigen-active components of Aspergillus fumigatus can be identified by means of the immunoblot technique, and that the IgE and IgG antibodies of persons with Aspergillus-related bronchopulmonary illnesses show characteristic reaction patterns which may be useful in differential diagnosis.",1985,3925546,no
Clinical and immunological reactions to Aspergillus niger among workers at a biotechnology plant.,"The workforce at a biotechnology plant producing citric acid by fermentation of molasses with a strain of Aspergillus niger was studied. A combination of a respiratory questionnaire and clinical assessment identified 18 subjects (4.9% of the workforce) with work related bronchospasm. In nine of these evidence of sensitisation to A niger was obtained by skin prick tests and radioallergosorbent test (RAST) using as an antigen an extract of the A niger culture fluid from the process. Of the 325 subjects without work related bronchospasm, only nine (2.7%) had a positive prick test. There were no subjects with symptoms of extrinsic allergic alveolitis. Investigation into the source of the antigen showed that whereas, in some areas of the plant, A niger spores were present, in others there were no detectable spores. In these areas, however, extracts of filters from air samplers were shown by RAST inhibition to contain A niger antigens, indicating that the culture fluid was generating airborne antigen. RAST inhibition studies showed that the A niger culture fluid used in the process contained antigens that were not present in a commercially available A niger extract, thus emphasising the importance in this type of investigation of using antigens prepared from material to which the workers are exposed.",1985,3986142,no
Detection of class-specific antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus antigens in various pulmonary diseases.,"Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a radioimmunoassay (RAST), the specific IgA, IgG, IgM and IgE antibody levels against Aspergillus fumigatus antigens were determined in sera from patients with either chronic bronchitis or non-allergic bronchial asthma, allergic asthma, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis or aspergilloma. These levels were compared with those in serum samples from healthy controls. The results showed statistical differences in specific antibody levels between the five groups of patients. It was not possible, however, to reliably classify a subject in one of the studied pathological groups on the sole basis of the assays used.",1985,3898993,no
Serum antibodies and their role in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity in aspergillosis.,"A total of 22 sera from patients with aspergilloma and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) were examined concomitantly for specific antibody against Aspergillus fumigatus antigen and for their activity in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against Aspergillus antigen-coated target cells. These sera demonstrated significant precipitin bands in agar gel double diffusion test (78% of ABPA and 75% of aspergilloma sera), while in indirect immunofluorescence studies all sera showed positive reactivity with a titer distribution of 1:40 to 1:160 and 1:40 to 1:320, respectively, for ABPA and aspergilloma sera. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay all sera demonstrated titers varying from 1:200 to 1:6400. Several sera also displayed marked cytotoxic reactions against A. fumigatus antigen-coated SB target cells in ADCC assays using normal lymphocytes as effector cells (35% of aspergilloma and 25% of ABPA sera). These findings suggest a role for ADCC activity in patients with Aspergillus infections.",1985,3891592,no
Immunomodulation of the antibody response to lipopolysaccharide in C3H/HeJ mice by complexing with heterologous ribosomes.,"We show that formaldehyde fixation of Salmonella typhimurium lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to ribosomes purified from Brucella abortus induced a primary immunoglobulin M (IgM) response to LPS in C3H/HeJ mice and upon revaccination resulted in elevated titers of IgM and induction of IgG antibody to the O antigens of LPS, as measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A similar LPS-Aspergillus fumigatus ribosomal complex yielded IgM and IgG antibody to LPS only after secondary stimulation. These results demonstrate that the hyporesponsiveness of C3H/HeJ mice with respect to antibody formation to LPS can be overcome by complexing this molecule to ribosomal particles and provide a theoretical mechanism for the action of some ""ribosomal"" vaccines. The results are compatible with the hypothesis that LPS in complex with the ribosomes is converted to a T-dependent form of the antigen to which the C3H/HeJ mice can respond.",1985,3980087,no
Serum antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus in Danish farmers.,182 Danish farmers and 105 city-dwelling control subjects were investigated for serum IgG antibodies to three purified Aspergillus fumigatus antigen fractions and unfractionated culture filtrate by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Farmers had higher levels of antibodies to all four ELISA antigens than non-farming controls. In farmers and controls high antibody activity was recorded with an antigen fraction of approximate molecular weight 470 000 daltons. Antibody levels to this fraction were higher in non-smokers than smokers in both study groups. Cattle farmers had higher antibody levels to the 470 000 daltons fraction than farmers with no animals on the farm. Farmers with higher antibody activity to any of the three fractionated ELISA antigens tended to have fewer respiratory symptoms than farmers with lower antibody activity. It was concluded that occupational exposure and smoking habits are the main determinants of the immune response to A. fumigatus in man.,1985,3925571,no
The evaluation of a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for anti-Aspergillus fumigatus IgG.,A standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method for anti-Aspergillus fumigatus IgG in human serum was modified to produce a quantitative assay.

"Mycobacterial, fungal, actinomycotic, and nocardial infections of the pleura.","Granulomatous pleuritis is relatively common, comprising about 10 per cent of all pleural effusions. A search for the etiologic agent is important since mycobacteria, fungi, and the higher bacteria Actinomyces and Nocardia produce similar clinical, radiographic, and pleural fluid findings.

Diagnosis and immunotherapy of mould allergy. I. Screening for mould allergy.,"In order to screen for mould allergy, extracts of five common atmospheric moulds (Cladosporium, Alternaria, Penicillium, Aspergillus and Mucor) from various manufacturers were investigated in 130 patients (5-60 years old) with clinical symptoms indicating possible mould allergy. The patients were screened by skin prick test (SPT) and radioallergosorbent test (RAST). SPT seemed to be more sensitive than RAST as a diagnostic screening procedure (80% positive reactions to one or more species compared to 50%). With a partially purified, standardized preparation of Cladosporium herbarum more positive reactions were obtained than with crude extracts without evidence of any unspecific reactions. The difference between commercial and standardized extracts is most probably a result of a variation of both the biological potency of allergenic determinants and the allergenic composition. A considerable number of negative RAST reactions with standard discs were found in patients with positive skin reactions to partially purified Cladosporium, but RAST seemed to be more sensitive than SPT with the other commercial mould extracts. Based on the screening, a very convincing tendency to IgE-reactivity to other moulds was found in patients reacting to Cladosporium, the most common cause of mould allergy. The results confirm the inadequacy of most mould extracts used in diagnostic procedures and strengthen the value of using standardized extracts.",1985,3993865,no
A method to determine significant levels of immunoglobulin G to Aspergillus fumigatus antigens in an ELISA system and a comparison with counterimmunoelectrophoresis and double diffusion techniques.,"A method is described which assesses results obtained from an ELISA system for the determination of human serum levels of IgG class antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus. The method is used to discriminate positive from negative samples, and significant antibody activity may be reported to the clinician, relative to a reference positive control serum monitored simultaneously under the same test conditions. Antibody content is expressed as the absorbance of a certain dilution of serum. Duplicate samples were analysed at a single serum dilution and their absorbtion values obtained from a semi-automated ELISA microplate reader. These were entered into a computer programmed to convert the data into units on a logarithmic scale. In parallel experiments, ELISA results were compared with those obtained by the techniques of counterimmunoelectrophoresis and double diffusion which measure precipitating antibody of all classes. A relatively good degree of correlation between tests was found only among sera with a high level of antibody.",1985,3930574,no
Antibody determination against Aspergillus fumigatus by means of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. II. Physico- and immunochemical properties of the polystyrene-binding components.,"Polystyrene-binding antigenic components (PBC) of Aspergillus fumigatus involved in ELISA IgG antibody determinations and the corresponding numbers of precipitates found by double immunodiffusion (DID) and/or crossed immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) were studied using culture filtrate antigenic preparations fractionated by Sephadex G-100 chromatography, concanavalin A (ConA) affinity chromatography, isoelectric focusing (IEF) and TCA precipitation. It is shown that PBC, immunologically active in ELISA, are characterized by high molecular weights and ConA-binding properties. The pI values of these components were 3.5-6 and above 8. The glycoprotein and/or mucopolysaccharide nature is suggested by the binding to ConA and their partial resistance to trichloroacetic acid treatment. By contrast, low-molecular weight components and antigenic components that are not absorbed by ConA being active in DID and/or CIE showed less or absence of binding to the polystyrene surface.",1985,3930408,no

Studies on toxin of Aspergillus fumigatus. XXII. Fashion of binding of Asp-hemolysin to human erythrocytes and Asp-hemolysin-binding proteins of erythrocyte membranes.,"The fashion of binding of Asp-hemolysin to human erythrocytes and the isolation of Asp-hemolysin-binding proteins from erythrocyte membranes were investigated by the immunocytochemical technique and affinity chromatography. Asp-hemolysin bound best at a pH range from 5 to 7. The erythrocytes treated with Asp-hemolysin showed diffuse, ring-like or cap-like staining by the peroxidase-labeled antibody method under the light microscope. The distribution of Asp-hemolysin on the erythrocyte surface was clearly observed as patches or caps in the scanning electron microscope. The erythrocyte ghosts were extracted with 1% sodium deoxycholate-0.1 M Tris-HC1 buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.2 M NaCl and 1 mM EDTA, and the extract was chromatographed on an affinity column consisting of Asp-hemolysin attached to activated thiol-Sepharose 4B. Four proteins present in the membrane extract were retained by activated thiol-Sepharose 4B and eluted with 50 mM cysteine as toxin-membrane components. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the polypeptides correspond to band 2.1, one protein of the 2 region, band 3 and band 7 in the Steck nomenclature system.",1985,3892239,no
Antibody determination against Aspergillus fumigatus by means of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. I. Liberation of polystyrene binding components during cultivation.,"The liberation of polystyrene binding antigenic components (PBC) of Aspergillus fumigatus involved in ELISA IgG measurements was studied during cultivation in the culture filtrates. PBC were rapidly liberated into the culture medium during the logarithmic phase of growth (phase I), were in part degraded or reconsumed during the stationary phase (phase II) and again secreted (other PBC) during the lytic phase (phase III). ELISA IgG titers and numbers of precipitating components are not always related with one another, may show an inverse relationship maximal ELISA titers are reached during phase I when precipitating components are limited. The striking similarity between the liberation of PBC and IgE-binding components is discussed.",1985,3891635,no
Detection of antigens in lung biopsies by immunoperoxidase staining in extrinsic allergic bronchiolo-alveolitis (EABA).,"Open lung biopsy specimens of 14 patients with extrinsic allergic bronchiolo-alveolitis (EABA) were studied by immunoperoxidase staining with avidin-biotin-complex method using nonconjugated antisera to Micropolyspora faeni, Thermoactinomyces vulgaris, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Aspergillus umbrosus. Antigenic intracellular material was found in macrophages and giant cells of granulomas in the lung tissue of 8 patients. This finding supports the hypothesis which suggests that macrophages and T-lymphocytes contribute to the tissue injury in EABA.",1985,2409726,no
Radioallergosorbent test (RAST) for measurement of IgG antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus in sera of patients with different lung diseases.,A radioallergosorbent test (RAST) for measuring human anti-Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) antibodies of the IgG class is described. The use of 125I-labelled animal antibodies against human IgG is compared with the use of 125I-labelled protein A. Under optimal conditions the radioactivity binding ratio between pooled patients' serum and pooled healthy persons' serum is 8-11.5. The immunoblotting technique was used to investigate so-called non-specific binding. The results obtained show that most if not all human sera contain anti-Af antibodies of the IgG type. The difference between pathological and normal immunological response to Af antigens seems to be in the antibody titres rather than in the presence or absence of antibodies to these antigens.,1984,6392421,no
Serum IgA antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.,"Serum IgA antibodies to three Aspergillus fumigatus antigen fractions were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 13 patients with aspergilloma, 23 patients with aspergillus lung infiltrates, 8 patients with allergic broncho-pulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), and 113 healthy blood donors. All three groups of patients had higher median serum IgA antibody levels against the three antigen fractions than healthy subjects. Thirty six (82%) of 44 patients had IgA antibody values to at least one antigen fraction above the 95 percentile of the blood donor group. Patients with aspergillomas and aspergillus lung infiltrates had slightly higher IgA antibody levels than ABPA patients. Determination of serum IgA antibodies to A. fumigatus antigen fractions had a lower diagnostic efficacy than previously found for IgG antibodies.",1984,6397961,no
Immunologic studies in bronchoalveolar fluid in a patient with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in a patient during an acute stage of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and repeated 17 mo later during a remission stage and cessation of corticosteroid therapy. Measurement of protein concentrations (albumin, IgG, IgA, and IgM) by laser nephelometry and crossed immunoelectrophoresis indicates that transudation of proteins occurs from the circulation into the lung compartment during the acute stage of ABPA. Furthermore, comparing total Ig concentrations and titers of ELISA IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus with the corresponding values of serum measurements indicates a preferential local production of IgA antibodies and IgM to a lesser extent. No indications were found for a local production of either IgG, total IgE, or IgE against A. fumigatus. During remission of the ABPA, titers of antibodies in the bronchoalveolar fluid (BAF) decreased to normal levels except IgA against A. fumigatus that remained elevated. The elevated titers of IgA in the BAF and IgE antibodies in the serum against A. fumigatus together with the elevated numbers of granulocytes in the BAF during the remission stage indicate that the immunologic situation is not yet normalized.",1984,6334111,no
Candida antigen detection in two premature neonates with disseminated candidiasis.,"Two premature neonates with birth weight less than 1,200 g developed systemic candidiasis during treatment with multiple antibiotics and parenteral hyperalimentation. Clinical findings included signs of necrotizing enterocolitis in one patient and multiple fungal renal cortical abscesses in the other. The Candida antigen, mannan, was present in the sera of both patients at the time of clinical deterioration. Multiple blood cultures and urine and stool samples from both patients grew Candida albicans. Systemic antifungal therapy was given for a 6-week period and was associated with prolonged antigenemia despite negative findings on follow-up cultures. Antifungal therapy was stopped soon after antigen was no longer detected. Both patients recovered without evidence of further fungal infection. Candida antigen detection may be useful in the diagnosis and follow-up of premature infants with disseminated candidiasis.",1984,6436783,no
Persistent neutrophilic meningitis. Report of four cases and review of the literature.,"Persistent neutrophilic meningitis is a poorly described variant of chronic meningitis characterized by the persistence of neutrophils in the CSF over extended periods of time (greater than 1 wk) in association with ongoing signs of meningeal inflammation and negative CSF cultures for bacteria and other pathogens. Although the incidence of persistent neutrophilic meningitis is difficult to ascertain, a review of available literature on CNS infections suggests that this entity is not rare. Etiologies of this syndrome are both infectious and noninfectious. Among infectious causes, bacteria such as Nocardia and Actinomyces and systemic mycoses such as Aspergillus and the zygomycetes are the predominant pathogens. The pathogenesis of the persistent neutrophilic CSF response is unknown with some infectious etiologies, there may be a correlation between neutrophil response and the morphology of the invading organism. Mycelial-like pathogens appear to be the primary stimulus for an ongoing neutrophilic inflammatory response. In cases of persistent neutrophilic meningitis, epidemiologic features and clinical setting frequently offer clues to the etiologic agent, especially in the immunocompromised host. Evaluation should include repetitive cultural and serologic studies of the CSF with special emphasis upon special cultural methods, antigen detection and detection of characteristic metabolic byproducts. Biopsy of extraneural sites of disease should be pursued whenever possible to provide data for an inferential diagnosis of CNS disease. CNS biopsies should be selectively performed in those patients undergoing craniotomy for evaluation of mass lesions. Therapy must be individualized. However, in the immunocompromised host, consideration should be given to the empiric use of amphotericin B with or without a sulfonamide in undiagnosed cases that manifest progressive clinical deterioration.",1984,6390082,no
Immunologic observations in sera of a patient with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis by means of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.,"Titers of IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus were measured by ELISA in sera of a patient with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis during an acute stage, remission, and exacerbation of the disease. Total IgE, specific IgE against A. fumigatus, and number of precipitation lines were also measured. ELISA IgG-, IgA-, and IgM-antibody titers were expressed in percentages of the titer of a strongly positive standard serum by use of the patient's own serum as a standard. The fall in antibody concentration (in percent) and elevations during exacerbation appeared to be similar for these antibody classes and are related with the number of precipitates measured by double immunodiffusion. Furthermore, the changes in antibody titers were also similar to the elevations and decreases in both total IgE and specific-IgE antibodies (also expressed in percentages of a chosen standard serum). The ELISA IgG-antibody titers were higher compared with the ELISA IgA or IgM titers and demonstrated a continuous decline during a period of 2 yr after the acute phase of ABPA. Therefore, IgG-antibody titers are preferred as an indicator of disease activity in follow-up studies over longer time periods and are at least as sensitive as the measurement of concentrations of IgE antibodies.",1984,6389649,no
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the paracoccidioidomycosis. Comparison with counterimmunoelectrophoresis and erythro-immunoassay.,"An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection and quantification of antibodies anti-Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is described. Polystyrene plates have been used as solid phase to absorb P. brasiliensis metabolic yeast phase antigen. Twenty sera of proven paracoccidioidomycosis, 11 of histoplasmosis due Histoplasma capsulatum, 20 of aspergillosis and 20 human normal sera were tested. Ninety-five percent of the paracoccidioidomycosis sera had O.D. superior to 0.150 (from 0.163 to 2.650) at 1/400 serum dilution. ELISA assay was compared with counterimmunoelectrophoresis and erythro-immunoassay tests a correlation was observed only with erythro-immunoassay. ELISA test should give new perspectives for the serodiagnosis of paracoccidioidomycosis.",1984,6392888,no
Effect of castanospermine on the structure and secretion of glycoprotein enzymes in Aspergillus fumigatus.,"Aspergillus fumigatus secretes a number of glycosidases into the culture medium when the cells are grown in a mineral salts medium containing guar flour (a galactomannan) as the carbon source. At least some of these glycosidases have been reported to be glycoproteins having N-linked oligosaccharides. In this study, we examined the effect of the glycoprotein processing inhibitor, castanospermine, on the structures of the N-linked oligosaccharides and on the secretion of various glycosidases. Cells were grown in the presence of various amounts of castanospermine at different times of growth, samples of the media were removed for the measurement of enzymatic activity. Of the three glycosidases assayed, beta-hexosaminidase was most sensitive to castanospermine",1984,6237100,no
Antibodies to hen and duck antigens in poultry workers.,"Serum antibodies to avian and Aspergillus antigens were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in forty-two workers from a poultry abattoir and in twenty healthy blood donors. The levels of IgG and IgA antibodies to hen and duck serum were significantly higher in poultry workers than in blood donors (P less than 0.01). In workers employed for less than 1 year the antibody levels were lower than in those who had been employed for a longer period of time (P less than 0.05). The IgA antibody level to a high molecular weight Aspergillus antigen was higher in poultry workers than blood donors (P less than 0.05), whereas the level of other Aspergillus antibodies were similar in the two groups. The level of IgG antibodies to hen antigen was higher in non-smokers than in smokers (P less than 0.02). A correlation between the antibody levels to hen and duck antigens and to pigeon antigen was found (P less than 0.05), indicating cross-reactivity between these antibodies. No cases of allergic alveolitis were found, and no correlation between antibody levels and respiratory symptoms could be demonstrated.",1984,6488512,no
Protection of chickens by ribosomal vaccines from Pasteurella multocida: dependence on homologous lipopolysaccharide.,"Chickens were protected against fowl cholera by ribosomal vaccines prepared from noncapsulated Pasteurella multocida. Passive hemagglutination (PHA) titers to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the degree of protection conferred by ribosomal vaccines were diminished or abolished when ribosomes were chromatographed on an immunoadsorbent column. Addition of subimmunogenic amounts of serotype 1 (homologous) LPS to highly purified ribosomes resulted in vaccines that protected against challenge exposure and produced PHA titers to homologous LPS. Addition of serotype 5 LPS to highly purified ribosomes did not protect chickens against challenge exposure with serotype 1 P multocida, but produced PHA titers to serotype 5 LPS. Combinations of serotype 1 ribosomal RNA and serotype 1 (homologous) LPS did not protect chickens or produce PHA titers to LPS. Purified ribosomes from Brucella abortus, Aspergillus fumigatus, and chicken liver were combined with LPS from P multocida and were evaluated as vaccines. Brucella abortus and A fumigatus ribosomes combined with LPS protected chickens as well as did bacterin made from whole cells of P multocida. Chicken liver ribosomes combined with LPS did not provide protection. To determine whether a protein carrier would substitute for ribosomes, methylated bovine albumin (MBA) was combined with LPS and evaluated as a vaccine. A serologic response to LPS was induced by MBA-LPS vaccine, but the vaccine offered no better protection than when LPS was used alone as vaccine. Ribosome-LPS vaccines produced serologic responses to LPS that were at least 5-fold greater than those produced by MBA-LPS vaccine.",1984,6208828,no
Evaluation of an indirect hemagglutination inhibition technique for identifying antibody in animals experimentally and naturally exposed to fungi.,"Rabbits were exposed to aerosols containing spores of Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, or of a Penicillium sp. Sera from these rabbits were tested by indirect hemagglutination (IHA) and by IHA inhibition. The serologic reactions with the rabbit sera were compared to reactions with sera from cattle naturally exposed to airborne microorganisms. By three months of age, most cattle had positive IHA reactions to A. fumigatus and Penicillium antigens. The IHA inhibition tests indicated that antibody production in 12 of the 20 cattle probably resulted from exposure to A. flavus. One calf reacted as if sensitized by A. niger. Two were totally nonreactive. Five of the cattle had reactions that were not identifiable relative to the reactions in rabbits.",1984,6493314,no
Measurement of specific IgE and IgG antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus antigen in patient sera by use of enzyme immunoassays: influence of different procedures of antigen immobilization.,"IgG and IgE antibody titers against Aspergillus fumigatus were measured in patient sera by enzyme immunoassays by use of antigens or allergens immobilized to different carriers. Specific-IgG antibodies were measured by a double antibody-layer enzyme immunoassay specific IgE was determined by Phadezym -RAST (Pharmacia Diagnostics). In both cases antigens and allergens were immobilized in two ways: first by covalent binding to CNBr-activated paper discs and second by spontaneous binding to polystyrene surface of microtiter plates. Much higher IgE-antibody titers were found with allergens immobilized to paper discs when these discs were compared with microtiter plates, which could be explained by a higher allergen-binding capacity of activated paper discs. On the contrary, higher IgG antibody titers were found with antigens bound to microtiter plates when these plates were compared with paper discs. It is concluded that IgG antibodies are directed against antigenic components that are preferentially bound to polystyrene surfaces.",1984,6373891,no
Microbiology of pneumonia in the patient at risk.,"Microorganisms causing pulmonary infections in high risk patients vary considerably with the predisposing illness (immunosuppression, alcoholism, or diabetes), the setting (nosocomial or community-acquired), and previous therapy (antibiotics, surgery, and inhalation therapy). Even in the immunocompromised patient, conventional bacteria are the most prevalent opportunistic pathogens, and gram-positive cocci such as staphylococci and gram-negative bacilli such as Escherichia coli cause most pneumonias. Fungi, viruses, and protozoa also cause pulmonary infections, but they vary in frequency from one institution to another. Diagnostic proof of the etiology of pulmonary infection is often difficult to obtain. The microbial flora of sputum is not definitive and must be confirmed by blood or pleural fluid culture, antigen or serologic response in body fluids, or morphologic presence in lung tissue. Resistance to antimicrobial therapy is increasing, especially among nosocomially acquired gram-negative bacilli and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. A potential for increased resistance exists in pneumococcal, viral, and fungal infection but is not yet apparent in pulmonary infections due to protozoal pathogens. Tests to predict antibiotic response such as serum bactericidal assay, repeated cultures, and serologic studies are helpful but correlate imperfectly with clinical outcome.",1984,6372479,no
The allergenic and antigenic properties of spore extracts of Aspergillus fumigatus: a comparative study of spore extracts with mycelium and culture filtrate extracts.,"The antigenic properties of conidial preparations of Aspergillus fumigatus were compared with mycelial and culture filtrate extracts by use of sera of patients with aspergillosis and hyperimmune rabbit serum. Biologic activities were tested by intracutaneous tests. The immunologic parameters used were: precipitating properties in double-diffusion, IgG binding by ELISA, IgE binding by enzyme inhibition assay, and by enzyme allergosorbent test. It has been demonstrated that the components that are released after disintegration of spores have positive titers in all immunologic assays. The immunologic properties of these spore plasma extracts are comparable with mycelial and/or culture filtrate extracts that are in accordance with the corresponding skin reactivities. Components that are released spontaneously from spores are only weakly positive or negative in the immunologic assays and demonstrate a very low biologic activity.",1984,6425387,no
Current trends in immunodiagnosis of candidiasis and aspergillosis.,"The methods and reagents currently used for the immunodiagnosis of aspergillosis and candidiasis are reviewed. Problems associated with these techniques and approaches to resolving these problems are discussed. Latex agglutination and precipitin tests are used for detection of antibody in immunocompetent hosts. However, these tests are apparently inadequate when applied to the diagnosis of systemic candidiasis in compromised hosts. Enzyme immunoassays ( EIAs ) and radioimmunoassays (RIAs) can be used to detect antibodies in immunocompetent and compromised patients, but their value is limited because antibodies to the Candida species are detectable in healthy as well as colonized and infected patients. EIAs and RIAs are, however, promising for detection of antigenemia in patients with aspergillosis or candidiasis, and gas-liquid chromatography has been developed for the quantitation of serum arabinitol and mannose in candidiasis. Antigens of the Aspergillus and Candida species may circulate in patients' sera in the form of immune complexes. These may readily be dissociated by a variety of methods to permit the detection of diagnostically important antigens. Studies are being carried out to increase the sensitivity and reliability of these tests through the use of monoclonal antibodies and purified, clinically relevant antigens.",1984,6377438,no
Glycosidases induced in Aspergillus tamarii. Secreted alpha-D-galactosidase and beta-D-mannanase.,"An alpha-D-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.22) and a beta-D-mannanase (EC 3.2.1.78), which were secreted into the growth medium when Aspergillus tamarii was cultivated in the presence of galactomannan, were purified by a procedure including chromatography on hydroxyapatite and DEAE-cellulose columns. Each of these enzymes showed a single protein band, corresponding to their respective activities, on polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. Both enzymes were shown to be glycoproteins containing N-acetylglucosamine, mannose and galactose, with molar proportions of 1:6:1.5 for alpha-D-galactosidase and 1:13:8 for beta-D-mannanase. Mr values as determined by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate and by the electrophoretic method of Hedrick & Smith [(1968) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 126, 155-164] were 56000 and 53000 respectively. The alpha-D-galactosidase differed markedly from the mycelial forms I and II studied in the preceding paper [Civas, Eberhard, Le Dizet & Petek (1984) Biochem. J. 219, 849-855] with regard to both its kinetic and structural properties.",1984,6331399,no
Serological tests in the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis.,"Sera from 44 patients with clinically suspected pulmonary aspergillosis (mainly of an allergic type) were examined for antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and counter-immunoelectrophoresis (CIE). Of the sera, 15 were considered to contain Aspergillus antibodies using ELISA 11 of these also contained precipitins by CIE. In no instance was a CIE-positive serum negative by ELISA. The serum of 1 patient with autopsy-verified invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was negative in both tests. Protein-enriched antigens derived by ammonium sulphate precipitation of crude hyphal homogenates seemed of most use in ELISAs. In addition, 4 of 8 sera obtained from patients with possibly invasive candidosis also revealed significant levels of Aspergillus antibody by ELISA (but not CIE). All of the 8 sera contained readily detectable Candida precipitins by CIE. Problems of potential cross-reactivity obviously need careful consideration with ELISAs. Our results suggest that ELISA procedures under appropriately controlled conditions are more sensitive than CIE for detecting Aspergillus antibodies. However it seems that some patients with invasive aspergillosis will be antibody-negative even with sensitive tests such as ELISA.",1984,6379582,no
Preparative isoelectric focusing of immunologically reactive components of Aspergillus fumigatus mycelium.,"A water-soluble mycelial extract of Aspergillus fumigatus has been fractionated by preparative isoelectric focusing using carrier ampholytes in a layer of granulated gel. The separated components were located by staining paper prints from the gel. Within a narrow pH range of 2.5 units, multiple protein bands were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G. Periodate-Schiff-positive material was generally associated with the major protein zones. When these fractions were eluted the total recovery, calculated on the basis of protein and carbohydrate analyses of the isolated fractions, varied between 20 and 60% of the applied material. Low recoveries were associated with low recoveries of protein recoveries of carbohydrate were higher and less variable. The immunological activity and specificity of the eluted fractions were assessed in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of IgG antibodies to A. fumigatus.",1984,6376702,no
Opportunistic fungal infections in patients with neoplastic disease.,"Opportunistic infections with yeast and molds are increasingly common in patients with neoplastic diseases. Candida species, Aspergillus species, Phycomyces, and Cryptococcus neoformans remain most common, but other organisms are being encountered as pathogens. With the exception of Cryptococcus, most opportunistic fungal infections are difficult to diagnose. New diagnostic tests for these diseases are being evaluated. Amphotericin B remains the antifungal agent of choice. In certain patients, the addition of 5-fluorocytosine may improve the outcome. Experience with cryptococcosis in severely immunocompromised cancer patients at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center suggests that those who are treated with amphotericin B intravenously and intraventricularly via an Ommaya reservoir along with 5-fluorocytosine do better than those treated with amphotericin B alone.",1984,6367457,no
Antigen and antibody attachment in ELISA for Aspergillus fumigatus IgG antibodies.,Four commercial antigen extracts of Aspergillus fumigatus were evaluated for use in a rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for anti-A. fumigatus IgG. Initial binding of both somatic and culture filtrate preparations to a polyvinyl chloride solid phase was concentration dependent and increased with incubation time. Antigen binding to the solid phase was reproducible. Binding of A. fumigatus precipitin-positive serum to bound antigen was rapid. All four A. fumigatus antigens demonstrated similar dose-response curves when tested against pooled sera containing a high titre of A. fumigatus antibodies. Detectable activity in precipitin test-negative sera decreased rapidly with dilution. All the antigen preparations were found to be suitable for ELISA procedures and permit the rapid determination of IgG antibodies to A. fumigatus.,1984,6363547,no
Fractionation of Aspergillus fumigatus antigens by hydrophobic interaction chromatography and gel filtration.,"Aspergillus fumigatus somatic antigen prepared from young hyphae was fractionated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography followed by gel filtration. The antigenic activity of fractions was investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, crossed immunoelectrophoresis, and immunodiffusion. By enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, high levels of IgG antibodies were detected against an antigen fraction of approximate molecular weight 470,000 both in patients with aspergillosis (n = 3) and in healthy controls (n = 3). High levels of antibodies to four fractions of MW 250,000 160,000, 160,000-50,000, and 50,000-25,000 were found only in patients. The MW 250,000 fraction exhibited catalase activity, and the MW 50,000-25,000 fraction had neutral protease activity. These purified aspergillus antigens may be useful in serodiagnosis of aspergillosis.",1984,6421747,no
Antibody to Aspergillus fumigatus antigens in normal sera: influence on positive-negative discrimination in ELISA.,"The response of precipitin-negative sera from non-selected asthmatic patients against a range of somatic and culture filtrate antigens of Aspergillus fumigatus in ELISA for anti-A. fumigatus IgG is described. Antibody to the various antigens was widely distributed but the precise distribution was dependent upon antigen type. To determine how the selection of negative reference sera from precipitin-negative sera can influence the discrimination between precipitin-positive and -negative sera in ELISA, panels of 10 sera were chosen from the extremes of the frequency distribution and by random selection. The closest agreement between precipitin testing and ELISA was seen when randomly-selected negative reference sera were incorporated in the assay, although the degree of correlation was dependent upon the detector antigen. These findings demonstrate the requirement for careful selection of sera included as negative reference sera in ELISA for anti-A. fumigatus IgG.",1984,6397481,no
Fungal serology in the elderly.,"90 geriatric patients without any clinical signs of systemic fungal infection had their sera tested for the presence of candida and aspergillus precipitins and cryptococcal antigens. None of the patients had positive aspergillus or cryptococcal serology. 13% of patients were found to have candida precipitins, but these cases were not significantly correlated with candida colonisation, length of hospitalisation, prior antibiotic therapy, steroid therapy or diabetes. Allowing for 13% false positives, serological testing might be helpful in identifying systemic candidiasis. It is probably highly specific for parenchymal involvement by aspergillus or cryptococcus.",1984,6394433,no
Evaluation of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the diagnosis of Aspergillus fumigatus intranasal infection of the dog.,ELISA appears to be a less reliable method than counterimmunoelectrophoresis for the diagnosis of nasal aspergillosis in the dog. False-positive or false-negative results were recorded for anti-A. fumigatus IgG in nine animals with aspergillosis and in 27 disease-free dogs although this problem could be reduced with careful selection of antigen.,1984,6379918,no
IgG antibodies to purified Aspergillus fumigatus antigens determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.,"IgG antibodies to three purified Aspergillus fumigatus antigens were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in sera from 26 patients with definite pulmonary aspergillosis (group 1), 23 patients with suspected pulmonary aspergillosis (group 2), 8 patients with precipitating antibodies to A. fumigatus of undetermined clinical significance (group 3), and 113 healthy blood donors (group 4). With a 470,000-dalton antigen fraction ELISA values exceeded the upper range of group 4 (0.72) in 92, 91 and 13% of cases in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. With a 250,000-dalton antigen fraction the figures were 96, 78 and 13%, respectively (upper range of group 4 = 0.25). With an antigen fraction of 25,000-50,000 daltons the figures were 96, 65 and 13%, respectively (upper range of group 4 = 0.18). In 48 of 49 cases of definite or suspected aspergillosis (groups 1 + 2) ELISA values with at least one antigen exceeded the upper range of controls (group 4). It appears that antibody determination with these three antigen fractions may have a high diagnostic sensitivity.",1984,6373622,no
Evaluation of a rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for IgG antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus in the serological diagnosis of allergic aspergillosis.,"A range of 6 somatic and culture filtrate antigens of Aspergillus fumigatus were evaluated in a rapid ELISA procedure for anti-A. fumigatus IgG where the component incubation times had been reduced to 10 min. Sera from patients with allergic aspergillosis, patients with suspected allergic aspergillosis, and asthmatic patients with or without A. fumigatus precipitins were tested. For all antigens, levels of anti-A. fumigatus IgG were higher in patients with allergic aspergillosis than in the other 3 groups. Low levels of specific IgG were, however, detected in asthmatic patients who had no precipitins against A. fumigatus. None of the antigen preparations enabled all patients with proven or suspected allergic aspergillosis to be separated from the other 2 groups of asthmatic patients. Positive-negative discrimination in ELISA was achieved by the inclusion of 10 pools of precipitin test-negative sera from the 50 asthmatics without A. fumigatus precipitins. The number of sera that were classed as positive in ELISA ranged from 9 to 15 in the allergic aspergillosis group, depending on the antigen used in the suspected aspergillosis group, the number of positive reactions ranged from 1 to 8, while in the asthmatics with precipitins, the number ranged from 0 to 2.",1984,6365791,no
Antigenic variability of different strains of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"10 strains (isolates) of Aspergillus fumigatus, grown and harvested under identical conditions, were compared with respect to biochemical and immunological properties. The total protein and carbohydrate content isoelectric focusing pattern were determined for each of the individual strains. Their antigenic and allergenic activity was examined by a combination of crossed immunoelectrophoresis (CIE)/crossed radioimmunoelectrophoresis (CRIE) and RAST inhibition. Biochemical and immunochemical data indicated that considerable variation exists between the various isolates of A. fumigatus. 44 antigens were demonstrated in CIE of A. fumigatus, and 18 different allergens were identified in CRIE (2 major, 10 intermediate and 6 minor allergens).",1984,6363306,no
Prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by Trichosporon cutaneum.,"We report, to our knowledge, the first case of Trichosporon cutaneum endocarditis which developed in a 58-year-old woman 14 months after mitral valve replacement. The patient had not had antibiotic therapy. She was treated with an oral antifungal agent, ketoconazol, and prosthetic valve replacement. The initial outcome was favorable, but she died 5 months later of aortic valve endocarditis. Fungal infection was documented by isolation of the fungus from blood cultures, by anatomical and pathological examination and by the changes in serology.",1984,6319306,no
Specificity of antigens from pathogenic Aspergillus species. I. Studies with ELISA and immunofluorescence.,"Studies were made by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) tests on the reactivities and specificities of 13 antigens prepared from four species of Aspergillus against antisera from immunized rabbits and 64 sera from patients with aspergillosis, other systemic mycoses and nocardiosis. Although reactions in both serological tests were invariably strongest with homologous antigen: antibody systems, antisera from rabbits immunized with A. fumigatus, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Candida albicans and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis reacted in the ELISA test with all of the Aspergillus antigens. In contrast, cross-reactivity was virtually non-existent with antiserum to Histoplasma capsulatum. Of five antigens prepared from A fumigatus tested by ELISA against human sera from patients with aspergillosis and other nocardial and systemic fungal infections, sensitivities varied from 81 to 100% for sera from 32 patients with aspergillosis, and specificities from 20 to 97% for sera from 30 patients with nocardiosis and other systemic mycoses. Purified A. fumigatus C antigen reacted weakly with sera from eight of these 30 patients, but the reactions were readily distinguishable from those obtained with sera from patients with aspergillosis. At optimal serum dilutions, cross-reactivities of A. fumigatus in the IFA studies were non-existent in the sera from 28 patients with candidosis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, paracoccidioidomycosis and nocardiosis. Sensitivities of IFA were 94% for patients with aspergilloma and 83% for patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.",1984,6209813,no
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis: reactivity of IgE and IgG antibodies with antigenic components of Aspergillus fumigatus (IgE/IgG antigen complexes).,"Sera of patients with ABPA were tested by XRIE tests incorporating their own serum (self-XRIE) to detect the presence of IgG/IgE antigen complexes to a ""reference"" Aspergillus fumigatus preparation. Of the 32 sera studied, 29 (90%) had visible precipitin (IgG) peaks, and 27 of these 29 as well as the three apparently precipitin-negative sera, i.e., 30 (94%), showed binding of specific IgE by autoradiography. The two precipitin-positive sera that did not show IgE binding were also skin test negative and RAST negative to this A. fumigatus antigen. Specific IgG as determined in ELISA correlated well with the grading of the XIE precipitin peaks (p less than 0.05). There was also a highly significant correlation between specific IgE by RAST and grading the radioactive uptake seen in the autoradiograph (p less than 0.001) indicating, for each serum, the presence of IgG antibodies to most of the components to which there was specific IgE. In the self-XRIE tests there was considerable variation of reactivity from serum to serum, in numbers of antigen/antibody peaks observed, in relative peak heights, and in the intensity of the respective staining. By comparing each test to a ""reference"" pattern developed with the use of an ABPA serum pool, the antigenic components of A. fumigatus were found to be of two main types: (1) antigens that appeared to be poorly precipitating (possibly low-molecular-weight components) but showed strong IgE binding (these were apparently major allergenic components and with one exception proved to be the faster migrating components) and (2) antigens that produced the strongest precipitin reactions with only weak binding of specific IgE and therefore minor allergenic components.",1983,6605984,no
"Antigen detection in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. Utility in controlled, blinded trials.","Two blinded, controlled trials were done to evaluate the usefulness of fungal antigen detection for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. Detection of Aspergillus fumigatus carbohydrate by radioimmunoassay was compared with antibody detection by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and with diagnostic microbiologic and histopathologic procedures. In the first trial, antigenemia was detected in 4 of 6 leukemic patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, but not in 8 acute leukemic controls or in 24 normal controls. Fungal antigenemia persisted for 8 to 75 days in 4 patients and seroconversion occurred at the onset of pulmonary infiltrates in 3. Antibody to A. fumigatus was detected in 2 of the 6 patients with aspergillosis, but also in 2 leukemic controls and 6 normal controls. Aspergillus species were identified in four of seven bronchoscopies done in 5 patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Prospective nasal cultures grew Aspergillus species in 4 of the 6 patients with invasive aspergillosis, but in only 1 patient was this information available before a histologic diagnosis was made. In a second trial, antigenemia was detected in 2 patients with invasive aspergillosis, and in 1 with possible invasive aspergillosis, but not in 9 controls. This study indicates that the radioimmunoassay for A. fumigatus antigen is a highly specific and moderately sensitive serodiagnostic test for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Prospective nasal cultures grew Aspergillus species in 4 of the 6 patients with invasive aspergillosis, but in only 1 patient was this information available before a histologic diagnosis was made. In a second trial, antigenemia was detected in 2 patients with invasive aspergillosis, and in 1 with possible invasive aspergillosis, but not in 9 controls.

The diagnostic approach to immediate hypersensitivity in patients with allergic rhinitis a comparison of nasal challenges and serum rast.,"Nasal challenges performed in 182 patients with allergic rhinitis revealed 273 positive and 125 negative responses to house dust, grass pollen, cat and dog danders and aspergillus fumigatus, which all correlated with disease history and intracutaneous tests. In these randomly selected patients the specific IgE antibodies in the serum to the same allergens as those used for nasal challenges were determined quantitatively by serum RAST. Additionally, blood and nasal eosinophilia were recorded during the nasal provocation tests. In all 273 positive challenges protection tests with disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) were also performed. In 24.2% of the positive nasal challenges serum RAST was found positive and in 18.7% of them serum RAST was doubtful. In 52% of the negative nasal challenges negative serum RAST also occurred. No significant correlation was found between serum RAST and nasal challenges (X2 = 0.92 d.f. = 1",1983,6614602,no
Comparison of antibody measurements against Aspergillus fumigatus by means of double-diffusion and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).,"IgG antibody titers against Aspergillus fumigatus from different sera were measured by means of a standardized ELISA and compared with precipitates measured by double diffusion (D.D.). There was a significant correlation between the number of precipitates and the ELISA IgG titers in the 758 sera examined. However, in several individual sera within this group, large deviations between these two immunologic parameters were found. Further analysis indicated that ELISA detects antibodies against nonprecipitating antigenic components in addition to the antibodies detected by D.D. Furthermore, not all precipitating antigenic components appear to play a role in the detection of antibodies against A. fumigatus by ELISA. Patients with aspergillosis largely show increased titers of IgG antibody by ELISA even when the results of D.D. are negative, except those of patients with Aspergillus-provoked asthma which fall within a normal range.",1983,6411795,no
Comparison of partially purified mycelial and culture filtrate antigens of Aspergillus fumigatus by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.,An aqueous extract of Aspergillus fumigatus mycelium was fractionated by precipitation with ammonium sulphate to give protein-enriched and carbohydrate-enriched preparations. The antigenic activity of the fractions so obtained was assessed in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using pooled positive and negative reference sera. The best discrimination between such sera was obtained when using either the fraction insoluble in 50--75% ammonium sulphate or the material soluble in a saturate solution of the salt. This system was then used in parallel with commercial A. fumigatus extracts to test sera of patients with and without clinical aspergillosis. The implications of the results are discussed.,1983,6356408,no
Immunochemical characterization of Aspergillus fumigatus antigens.,"Culture filtrate antigens of Aspergillus fumigatus Ag 534 were purified by preparative isoelectric focusing and affinity chromatography. One of the pooled antigen fractions from the preparative isoelectric focusing step (pool 2) was passed through a concanavalin A column and yielded two components, designated antigens IIa and IIb. Antigen IIb reacted more strongly than antigen IIa with all of the aspergilloma and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis sera tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The glycoprotein nature of antigen IIb was shown by the concanavalin A binding properties and staining reactions of the components.",1983,6347893,no
Antigens of Aspergillus fumigatus. II. Electrophoretic and clinical studies.,"Cell sap (CS) and culture filtrate (CF) preparations of Aspergillus fumigatus strains Ag-507, Ag-515, and Ag-534 were analysed by two dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE i.e., first dimension isoelectric focusing, second dimension sodium dodecyl sulphate gradient pore gel), which enabled detection of strain- and species-specific components. In CS preparations it was shown that CS2, a fraction isolated from strain Ag-507 by gel filtration, consists of the major protein components in the CS of the three A. fumigatus strains tested. Culture filtrate preparations of the three A. fumigatus strains analysed by 2-DE exhibited patterns dissimilar to the CS patterns, as well as to each other, presumably due to proteolysis. Culture filtrate preparations are therefore a less reliable source of standardized antigens than CS preparations. CS2 has a major component with a mol. wt. of approximately 150,000 and an sapp of 6.3 S. CS2 reacts on immunoelectrophoresis, producing one major precipitin arc with aspergilloma or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) patient sera. Antibody titres of the IgG and IgA classes to CS2, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), were demonstrated to be similar in aspergilloma and ABPA patients",1983,6347877,no
Antigens/allergens of Aspergillus fumigatus. Identification of antigenic components reacting with both IgG and IgE antibodies of patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"Evidence that both IgE and IgG antibodies present in the sera of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis patients (ABPA) combine with several of the antigenic components of Aspergillus fumigatus has been obtained using a self-crossed radioimmunoelectrophoresis test. In this test, patient's serum was used to develop its own crossed immunoprecipitation pattern to a reference antigen before proceeding to autoradiography with 125I-anti-human IgE in the usual way. Comparison of autoradiograph with immunoprecipitate showed a varied pattern of reactivity, i.e. precipitin peaks with and without associated radioactivity, as well as some peaks appearing only in the autoradiograph. Control sera, including sera from A. fumigatus skin test positive patients and a skin test negative aspergilloma patient with multiple precipitins showed no such combined activity. The specificity of the test was further demonstrated using an ABPA serum pool, both by absorbing the IgE from the serum before incorporation in the gel and also by heat inactivation (56 degrees C, 4 h) of the serum to destroy the heat labile determinants on IgE molecules, thus preventing the uptake of the anti-IgE specific for these determinants.",1983,6192954,no
A radioimmunoassay index for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"Differentiating patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis from those with asthma who have immediate cutaneous reactivity to Aspergillus fumigatus may be difficult. Both groups have IgE and IgG antibodies against aspergillus antigen. We describe methods for establishing IgE and IgG antibody indices using sera from asthmatic patients as a control serum pool. The IgE and IgG antibody indices are usually both positive and at least one index was positive in all patients during the acute stage. The indices had diagnostic value in individual patients during the other four stages, but were not consistently positive in patients in any other stage. In a patient with a suspected case, serodiagnosis should be attempted before corticosteroid therapy is started thus, acute-phase serum should be obtained and stored before therapy.",1983,6859719,no
Circulating immune complexes and rheumatoid factors in patients with farmer's lung.,"Circulating IgG immune complexes (CICs), IgM rheumatoid factors (RFs), complement level (C3 and C4), and IgG antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus umbrosus, Thermoactinomyces vulgaris, and Micropolyspora faeni were analysed in the sera of 14 patients with farmer's lung (FL), 10 in the acute and four in the subacute phase of the disease. Ten spouses of FL patients served as exposed healthy controls. C3 and C4 were measured fluoronephelometrically. C3 levels were above the normal range and C4 levels near the upper limit of the normal range in both patients and controls no statistically significant difference between patients and controls were observed. CICs were determined by enzyme immunoassays (EIA) of conglutinin-binding (KgB) and Clq-binding (ClqB). CIC levels above the normal range were detected in 12 (KgB-EIA) and nine (ClqB-EIA) of the patients and three (KgB-EIA) and six (ClqB-EIA) of the controls. No statistically significant differences were found in the mean levels between patients and controls. In contrast, RF levels in the acute phase of FL were significantly higher in the patients (P less than 0.01) than in the controls. CICs correlated positively with most microbial IgG antibodies, but negatively with RFs. RFs also correlated negatively with microbial IgG antibodies, as well as with both C3 and C4. In FL, the increased RF level may, in the absence of increased CIC and decreased complement levels, represent an immune response (IgM anti-IgG autoantibodies) induced by local mechanisms of IgG immune complexes in the lungs.",1983,6351661,no
Antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus in bronchial secretions from patients without aspergillosis.,"Antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus were investigated by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in bronchial secretions (BS) and sera from 40 patients with neoplasia, lung infiltrates of non-fungal aetiology or chronic bronchitis. By IIF, IgG aspergillus antibodies were found in 23 samples of BS (58%) (titre range 10-40) and in all 40 sera (titre range 10-1280). IgA aspergillus antibodies were detected in 33 samples of BS (83%) (titre range 10-160) and in 33 sera (83%) (titre range 10-40). IgM aspergillus antibodies occurred in 2 samples of BS (5%) (titre 10 and 40) compared with 35 sera (88%) (titre range 10-40). Antibodies with secretory component (SC) were detected in 20 of 39 BS samples tested (51%) (titre range 10-160). Significantly higher levels of IgA antibodies were detected by ELISA in BS than in serum (2p less than 0.05) and, conversely, significantly higher levels of IgG antibodies were found in serum than in BS (2p less than 0.001). Low levels of antibodies with SC were also detected in BS by ELISA. These results suggest that aspergillus antibodies are produced within the bronchopulmonary system in patients without aspergillosis.",1983,6880743,no
Invasive fungal infections. The use of serologic tests in diagnosis and management.,"Serologic tests are useful in providing a presumptive diagnosis of invasive fungal infection, allowing early institution of specific therapy.

Serum antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus in patients with rheumatic diseases.,"IgG and IgA serum antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus were determined in 47 patients with rheumatic disorders, 4 patients with pulmonary aspergillosis associated with rheumatic disease, and in 36 healthy controls. Antibody titres determined by indirect immunofluorescence were comparable in patients with rheumatic diseases and in controls, except for 2 patients with IgG antibody titres within the upper range of patients with aspergillosis. IgG antibody levels to 2 partially purified A. fumigatus antigens (I and VIII), determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), were higher in rheumatic patients than in controls and with antigen VIII the difference reached statistical significance for all subgroups of rheumatic patients. IgA antibody levels by ELISA were also increased in rheumatic patients compared with the control group: IgA levels against antigen I fell within the range of patients with aspergillosis in 7 patients with rheumatic disorders. This suggests that some rheumatic patients are more strongly sensitized to Aspergillus antigens than normal subjects.",1983,6348977,no
Measurement of immunoreactive alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone in the blood of rainbow trout kept under various conditions.,"Initial attempts to measure alpha-MSH in trout blood by radioimmunoassay proved unsuccessful due to apparent losses of immunoreactive hormone, especially in the plasma of trout adapted to a black background. An extraction protocol for alpha-MSH from plasma is described. Subsequent radioimmunoassay revealed progressive increases in immunoreactive alpha-MSH as trout became adapted to a black background. Plasma alpha-MSH titres were raised during fungal infection, and also showed significant differences in fish obtained from different fish farms.",1983,6854194,no
Efficacy of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serodiagnosis of aspergillosis.,"Sera from 43 cases of aspergillosis, 73 cases of other bronchopulmonary diseases, and 50 healthy persons were examined for the presence of antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus.

Candidal antigen detection in pulmonary candidiasis.,"To better characterize pulmonary candidiasis, lung tissue samples from 58 hospital subjects were examined by immunohistochemical analysis with antiserums to candidal mannan and cytoplasmic antigens. In nine cases of invasive pulmonary candidiasis, fungal antigens were abundant in lung specimens and were distributed in two immunohistologic patterns. Antigen dissemination beyond the lung was confirmed by detection of antigenemia by mannan radioimmunoassay in serum samples in cases of pulmonary candidiasis of each immunohistologic pattern. In contrast, minimal, focal quantities of fungal antigens were detected in lung tissue specimens from nine subjects with thrush or aspiration but without pulmonary candidiasis no antigen was detected in 40 additional cases of noncandidal mycotic, bacterial, viral, and parasitic pneumonias. Immunohistochemical criteria that denote invasive pulmonary candidiasis include the abundance of diffuse candidal antigens in bronchiolar and alveolar fluid and cytoplasmic staining of phagocytes. When compared with routine histologic stains, the diagnostic yield in cases of invasive pulmonary candidiasis was significantly increased by detection of candidal antigenic material. This study of 58 well-documented cases shows that immunohistochemical detection of candidal antigens facilitates the diagnosis of candidal pneumonia and distinguishes clinically significant pulmonary candidiasis from noninvasive aspiration, opportunistic colonization, or specimen contamination.",1983,6340490,no
Use of Aspergillus fumigatus mycelial antigens in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and counter-immunoelectrophoresis.,"Antigens obtained from the ruptured mycelium of Aspergillus fumigatus were separated on the basis of their attachment or non-attachment to Concanavalin A-linked Sepharose gel. They were analysed by double-diffusion and two-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis with rabbit antiserum and sera from patients with aspergillus-related disease. Their sensitivity was assessed in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for immunoglobulin G. Sera which gave very low or high extinction readings on ELISA gave, in general, comparable results on counter-immunoelectrophoresis but weak electrophoretic reactions were not closely paralleled by ELISA results.

"Serum IgE and IgE antibody levels in patients with bronchial asthma, atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic granulomas of the soft tissue (Kimura's disease) and other diseases.","Hyper-IgE immunoglobulinemia was observed in bronchial asthma, atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic granuloma of the soft tissue (Kimura's disease), disseminated visceral eosinophilic granulomas (Zuelzer-Apt syndrome) and disseminated eosinophilic collagen disease, IgE antibodies to environmental allergens (Dermatophagoides farinae mites, Aspergillus fumigatus, mountain cedar pollen, and Candida albicans) were found in bronchial asthma, atopic dermatitis and combinations of the two, but were not significantly detected in the latter three diseases. Hyper-IgE immunoglobulinemia may be divided into two groups on the basis of the presence of specific IgE antibodies directed to environmental allergens. The presence of antimite IgE antibodies in atopic dermatitis sera was confirmed by radioimmunoelectrophoresis. Anti-mite IgE antibodies in atopic dermatitis were heterogeneous in their specificity and the allergenic moieties to which IgE antibodies were directed varied from one case to another.",1983,6600385,no

[Current methods of immunologic diagnosis in parasitology].,"This review of the immunological diagnosis of parasitic diseases defines the various indications, the means of collection and preparation, the various levels of specificity and the choice of parasitic antigen which should be used for immuno-diagnosis. The detection and assay of circulating antibodies relies on the techniques of immuno-precipitation (immunodiffusion, immunoelectrophoresis, electrosyneresis), indirect agglutination (latex and haemagglutination) or the use of labelled compounds (immunofluorescence, enzymo-immunoassay, radio-immunoassay). Their respective advantages and disadvantages are discussed. The detection and assay of circulating antigens involve the use of agglutination techniques (mycoses), radio-immunoassay or enzymo-immunoassay (protozooses and helminthiases). The authors review the applications of immunological diagnosis for the helminthiases (Trichinosis, Toxocarosis, Filariasis, Anguillosis, Ascaridiasis, Echinococcosis, Taeniasis and Cysticercosis, Distomatosis and Schistosomiasis), the protozoan infections (malaria, Toxoplasmosis, Amebiasis, Trypanosomiasis, Leishmaniasis) and the mycoses (Aspergillosis, Candidiasis, Cryptococcosis). They also discuss the prospects for the development of immunological diagnosis by identification, purification and standardization of parasitic antigens and the study of circulating antigens and idiotypic anti-parasitic antibodies. Finally, they outline the respective responsibilities of the biologist and the prescribing doctor for the proper use of immunological diagnosis of parasitic diseases.",1983,6364900,no
Determination of antibodies to partially purified aspergillus antigens by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.,"A total of 75 sera from 17 patients with pulmonary aspergillosis and 58 controls were investigated by ELISA for IgG antibodies against different antigen fractions of Aspergillus fumigatus. Somatic antigen obtained by homogenization of young hyphi was fractionated on a Sephadex G-200 column, and 11 antigen fractions (I-XI) were prepared. Antibodies to fractions I-XI were detected in sera from patients with aspergillosis, whereas antibodies in sera from control patients and healthy blood donors were directed against only 7 fractions (I-VII). Antibodies against fraction VIII with an approximate molecular weight of 70,000 appeared to be of high diagnostic significance for pulmonary aspergillosis.",1983,6337106,no

Sexually transmitted diseases in pregnancy.,"Numerous sexually transmitted diseases--syphilis, gonococcal infections, group B beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection, chlamydial infections, mycoplasmas, herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus infections, hepatitis B viral infections, fungal infection, trichomonas vaginalis, condylomata acuminata, and scabies--are of concern when they occur during pregnancy, either because of their potential adverse effects on the fetus or the chance of a modified reaction in the pregnant woman.  This article discusses each of these venereal diseases in turn, providing information on diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.  Pregnancy appears to have a benign effect on syphilis in the mother, but the fetus is likely to suffer from abortion, intrauterine death, intrauterine growth retardation, and congenital syphilis, underscoring the need for serologic testing of symptomatic pregnant women and treatment with penicillin.  Neisseria gonorrhoea, still a prevalent sexually transmitted disease among women of childbearing age, is of considerable seriousness during pregnancy due to the risk of contamination of the newborn during passage through the birth canal.  Infants delivered of women infected with chlamydia may develop a neonatal inclusion conjunctivitis, nasopharygitis, otitis media, or an afebrile pneumonia syndrome.",1982,6293753,no
Nonbacterial pneumonia after allogeneic marrow transplantation: a review of ten years' experience.,"Pneumonia due to causes other than bacterial or fungal infection has been a frequent complication of allogeneic marrow transplantation. Data on 525 patients who received allogeneic marrow transplants during a 10-year period were reviewed. Of these patients, 41% developed pneumonia this incidence was significantly higher than that among recipients of syngeneic (twin) transplants. Cytomegaloviral pneumonia (85 cases) and idiopathic pneumonia (63 cases) occurred most commonly. The incidence of pneumonia was higher among older patients, among patients who received transplants because of hematologic malignancy, and among patients with aplastic anemia who received total-body irradiation or procarbazine plus antithymocyte globulin for conditioning before transplantation. The development of cytomegaloviral pneumonia was unrelated to the serologic characteristics of either the patient or the donor before transplantation, and an increase in the titer of antibody to cytomegalovirus did not significantly improve the chances for survival. Mortality from all forms of pneumonia was high. Until effective means for prevention or treatment of cytomegaloviral and idiopathic pneumonia become available, the occurrence of these infections will continue to limit the success of allogeneic marrow transplantation.",1982,6296961,no
Sarcoidosis and aspergilloma. The role of surgery.,"Fibrocystic pulmonary disease is a common sequel of chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis, and the subsequent development of intracavitary aspergillomas is frequent, especially in black patients. Pulmonary hemorrhage from aspergilloma is second only to cardiorespiratory failure as the cause of death in sarcoidosis. Opinions regarding the role of resectional surgery are conflicting. We report observations on 38 patients with biopsy evidence of antecedent sarcoidosis and cultural or serologic identification of Aspergillus species as cause of the fungus balls. Pulmonary fibrosis was bilateral and extensive in most cases, making surgical treatment perilous. Ten patients had moderate impairment of pulmonary function. Seven had surgical resection with six satisfactory results and one death. Three patients in this category have not required surgery. Twenty-eight patients had severely compromised pulmonary function. Surgery was performed in seven because of intractable bleeding four survived, but three later died of respiratory failure. Of the 21 in this category not treated by surgery, six survived, four died of hemorrhage and 11 of respiratory failure. Of the 37 patients with aspergilloma whose status is known, 19 are dead, 14 survived with positive precipitins and four, all treated surgically, recovered. It is concluded that surgical treatment of aspergilloma in patients with sarcoidosis should be avoided if possible, but is inescapable in a third of cases.",1982,7116961,no
Rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for Aspergillus fumigatus antibodies.,"A rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) where component incubation periods were shortened to one hour, was compared with agar gel double diffusion (AGDD) and a standard ELISA procedure for detecting antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus in 28 asthmatic patients with suspected allergic aspergillosis. Using two A fumigatus antigens the rapid ELISA compared well with AGDD and the standard ELISA method. Eleven sera that reacted with both antigens in AGDD were all positive against antigen 1 in both forms of ELISA, but two failed to react with antigen 2 in the standard ELISA and three failed to react with this antigen in the rapid method. Thirteen AGDD-negative sera were also negative in both forms of ELISA.

Aspergillus antigen detection in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with invasive aspergillosis and aspergillomas.,"Improved diagnostic techniques have been needed for pulmonary aspergillosis, a common opportunistic fungal infection with a high mortality rate. Radioimmunoassay was used in this study to detect Aspergillus antigen in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In four patients with invasive aspergillosis or aspergillomas, Aspergillus antigen was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In two patients, results of fungal cultures were negative or delayed. The specificity of antigen detection in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was 91 percent in 35 control patients with a variety of pulmonary disorders. The technique or radioimmunoassay detection of microbial antigen in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid appears promising for the diagnosis of aspergillosis.",1982,7124764,no
Specific serum IgE antibodies to bacterial antigens in allergic lung disease.,"A radio-allergosorbent test (RAST) to measure specific IgE antibodies in man to whole bacterial cells of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae was developed to investigate different well-defined lung diseases (chronic bronchitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), bronchial asthma allergic rhinitis, cystic fibrosis) and also in urticaria as compared with non-atopic blood donors. In addition, total IgE values and skin prick tests were assessed in these patients. The ABPA group gave the highest specific IgE RAST scores to all three bacteria, whilst the chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis groups also gave raised RAST scores with H. influenzae. There was a positive correlation between the patients' Sta. aureus and Str. pneumoniae immediate-type skin reactions and their RAST scores and total serum IgE concentrations, but there was only a low incidence of immediate-type skin test positivity to H. influenzae.",1982,6982789,no
Serology of Aspergillus granuloma.,"A total of 21 cases of granuloma caused by Aspergillus species were encountered during the period 1972-79. The organs involved were nasal and paranasal sinuses, brain, orbit, subcutaneous tissue of check, lungs and endocardial valve in the decreasing order of their frequency. Aspergillus flavus was the main etiological agent. Immunodiffusion tests with various Aspergillus species as antigen showed a positively of 17 out of 18 (94.4 per cent) cases. The role of precipitins in diagnosis and prognosis of the disease has been discussed.",1982,6813743,no
Diagnostic value of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of Candida albicans cytoplasmic antigen in sera of cancer patients.,"To diagnose systemic candidiasis we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the quantitation of Candida albicans cytoplasmic antigen in sera of cancer patients. The antigen concentration was evaluated in 59 patients divided into several groups according to clinical, histological, and microbiological findings as well as antimicrobial treatment. All of seven patients with proven disseminated candidiasis had elevated antigen concentrations (mean = 1,200 ng/ml). Among 13 patients with suspected disseminated candidiasis, 9 had elevated antigen concentrations (mean = 1,039 ng/ml). The remaining four patients showed negative antigen (less than 125 ng/ml). In a group of patients with fever of unknown origin, 5 of 17 had high antigen concentrations (mean = 1,220 ng/ml) and the rest were negative. Patients with bacterial infection (6 patients), aspergillosis (3), cryptococcosis (4), coccidioidomycosis (3), and no infection (6), as well as normal healthy adults (31), had antigen concentrations of less than 100 ng/ml. This ELISA is rapid, sensitive, and specific and is a helpful diagnostic tool in the evaluation of candidiasis in cancer patients.",1982,7050165,no
Comparison of Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus umbrosus antigens in serological tests of farmer's lung.,"A comparison was made between Aspergillus fumigatus and A. umbrosus antigens regarding their usefulness in serological tests of farmer's lung. Mycelial and culture fluid antigens of both microbes were used to test sera of 30 Finnish farmer's lung patients for antibodies in the ELISA and in the gel precipitation (GP) test. Antibodies to A. umbrosus were more common than to A. fumigatus this was especially evident in ELISA, ELISA gave more positive results with all four antigens than GP. Mycelial antigens showed more positive reactions in ELISA than the corresponding culture fluid antigens. The situation was reversed in GP. Selection of antigens in the diagnostic panel of farmer's lung requires careful consideration. Our results suggest that other Aspergilli (in the Finnish population A. umbrosus) might be preferable to A. fumigatus in the antigen panel.",1982,6812448,no
Current management of fungal enteritis.,"Fungal infections of the gastrointestinal tract have risen to higher levels of prevalence in the past decade. Major factors accounting for this increase are social changes, such as the increased ease and frequency of travel, which exposes the individual to environmental conditions that may result in fungal infection increasing use of antibiotic and hormonal medications by otherwise healthy persons",1982,6281592,no
"Mycobacterial antibodies after tuberculin testing, BCG- vaccination, BCG-immunotherapy and against cross-reacting antigens in a solid-phase radioimmunoassay.","A solid-phase radioimmunoassay (SPRIA) was used to investigate several factors influencing false positive and negative results in serodiagnostic test for tuberculosis, Unheated cytoplasmic fractions of mycobacteria, and other microorganisms were bound to polystyrol and antibody binding of sera from tuberculous, non tuberculous hospitalized patients and healthy adults was tested by the SPRIA-method. The level of antibody concentration in the SPRIA reflects roughly cross-reactivity between the antigens. Similar antibody binding occurred with M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. ulcerans and several ""atyical"" mycobacteria as test antigens, while other mycobacterial species and one of two tested tuberculin preparation (PPD) showed less antibody binding capacity. Significant cross-reactivity of fourty to sixty per cent was found between M. tuberculosis and N. asteroides but no cross-reaction was observed with C. parvum, S. typhi, S. paratyphi, C. Albicans or Aspergillus niger. Heating of mycobacterial cytoplasmic antigen resulted in a decrease of the test specifity. Tuberculin testing and intracutaneous BCG-vaccination in healthy adults had no distinct influence on the antibody response against several mycobacterial test antigens. However, a rapid increase of antibody levels was documented in melanoma patients after BCG-immunotherapy by sacrification with a more concentrated vaccine.",1982,6805156,no
Serodiagnostic value of culture filtrate antigens from aspergilli with septate phialides.,"Culture filtrate antigens from 6 typical isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus, 6 isolates with septate phialides, and isolates of A. fumigatus var. ellipticus, A. fishceri, A. flavus and A. niger were studied in tests with 2,100 samples of serum originating from 1,452 patients suffering from miscellaneous diseases, including 60 cases of aspergillosis, 850 samples of serum from apparently healthy blood donors and 522 sera referred to us as positive for C-reactive protein. The culture filtrate antigen prepared from a septate-phialide-strain proved to be most useful in detecting precipitating antibodies in the sera of patients suffering from aspergillosis caused by A. fumigatus. The antigen from this strain not only gave sharper and a larger number of precipitin bands than others but also proved to be an invaluable tool in the serodiagnosis of 5 to 56 (8.9%) A. fumigatus cases in which all other antigens repeatedly failed to give a positive result. The serological data also suggest that the septate-phialide strains are mutants of A. fumigatus and should not be classified as a separate species.",1982,6801788,no
Application of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"IgE and IgG antibodies against Af were measured by ELISA in sera from 15 patients with ABPA and compared with antibody levels in six patients with extrinsic asthma and immediate-type skin reactivity to Af (prick skin test 3+ or 4+) but no other evidence for ABPA. The assay used polyvinyl microhemagglutination plates as a solid phase to adsorb antigens of Af and a double-antibody system of class-specific anti-human globulin and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit globulin. IgE-Af and IgG-Af were significantly greater among patients with ABPA than in patients with asthma, suggesting that this assay may be used as an important diagnostic aid. The advantages of ELISA over radioimmunoassay are discussed in regard to early detection of an indolent pulmonary disease.",1982,7038011,no
Multiple splenic aspergillomas in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"A case of multiple splenic aspergillomas (mycetomas) without systemic involvement is a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia is described. The patient underwent splenectomy without concomitant antifungal therapy. There has been no recurrence of the disease for over two years. Granulocytopenia and airborn contamination may have played a role in the acquisition of this disease. The value of serology, radionuclide scans and cultures in the diagnosis of Aspergillus infections is explored. The role of granulocyte transfusions, antifungal chemotherapy and the achievement of bone marrow remission in localization of the fungal disease is discussed.",1982,6956241,no
Aspergillus Peritonitis complicating perforated appendicitis in adult acute leukemia.,"A 38-year-old male with terminal transferase positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia experienced fever, polymicrobial bacteremia, gastrointestinal bleeding, abdominal pain during induction therapy, and remission.

Peritoneal dialysis complicated by Aspergillus flavus peritonitis: a role for fungal antigen serodiagnosis.,"A patient is described with aspergillus peritonitis associated with peritoneal dialysis. Although the diagnosis was established by exploratory laparotomy, aspergillus antigenemia was detected retrospectively in sera obtained 15 days prior to the surgical procedure. An approach to the evaluation of a patient with culture negative peritonitis and the potential clinical usefulness of the detection of fungal antigen in serum and peritoneal fluid of patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis is discussed.",1982,6818482,no

"Plasma alpha-fetoprotein concentrations in pregnant cows exposed to Sarcocystis cruzi, Campylobacter fetus, or Aspergillus fumigatus.","Bovine alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was determined in maternal plasma, using radioimmunoassay in an attempt to detect and monitor fetal distress in pregnant cows. Plasma from pregnant cows in the 4th to 5th month of the gestation which had been exposed to Sarcocystis cruzi, Campylobacter fetus, or Aspergillus fumigatus was used. Plasma AFP concentrations were determined at intervals from before the cows were exposed until they had aborted or calved. The plasma AFP concentration of the exposed pregnant cattle remained at 6.5 +/- 5.0 mg/ml until 24 to 48 hours before abortion or parturition, when the value increased to 25.0 +/- 8.0 ng/ml. This pattern was similar for cattle exposed to each of the infective agents. Unlike in persons, rats, or monkeys, fetal-maternal transfer of AFP seems to be minimal in cows even with inflammation or necrosis of the placentome, Thus, changes in AFP concentrations in bovine plasma cannot be used as a diagnostic tool for fetal distress or fetal death.",1981,6176152,no
Atopy and cystic fibrosis. A study of CF sibling pairs and their families.,"We have investigated the prevalence of atopy within families of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and compared its frequence in CF patients, their parents and their non-CF siblings. By studying families with two CF patients it was also possible to evaluate the factors influencing the development of atopy in one CF patient relative to the other patient within the same family. A significant correlation with age (P less than 0.001) for skin test positivity to common allergens within CF sibling pairs was observed. In 14/18 families studied, only the older CF patient was atopic. The presence of atopy in CF patients was independent of the atopic status of their parents.",1981,7333002,no
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis with low serum immunoglobulin E.,"Elevated total serum IgE is helpful in making the diagnosis of ABPA and in monitoring the onset of exacerbations and response to therapy. ABPA occurs frequently in patients with CF, and in these instances a high total serum IgE is seen. This is the first case report of ABPA without an elevated total serum IgE level. At no time prior to this patient's first episode of ABPA, at the time of the illness, or at monthly intervals during follow-up did her total serum IgE level exceed 29 IU/ml.",1981,7026647,no
Immunodiagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in rabbits. Fungal antigen detected by radioimmunoassay in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.,"To improve antemortem diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, we used a radioimmunoassay to detect an Aspergillus fumigatus antigen in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and evaluated this technique in a model of disseminated aspergillosis. Antigen was detected in 91% of BALF samples obtained from 11 rabbits with major pulmonary aspergillosis. In an additional 10 rabbits with only minor pulmonary involvement, antigen was detected in 40% of concentrated lavage samples. In contrast, antigenlike activity was found in only 1 of 17 BALF samples from control animals with systemic candidiasis, in none of 9 control animals with staphylococcal pneumonia and in none of 10 normal control animals. Although antigen was present in the serum of 76% of animals infected with Aspergillus, 27% of those with major pulmonary involvement had antigen detected in BALF alone. We found that an extracellular microbial antigen can be detected in BALF and that this technique in the disseminated aspergillosis model is both sensitive and specific for invasive pulmonary disease.",1981,7020504,no
Immunoperoxidase staining in the recognition of Aspergillus infections.,"This study concerns the use of the indirect immunoperoxidase technique for labelling Aspergillus species in infected human and animal tissues in smears taken from cultures. Specific labelling without serious cross-reactivity with Candida species or Zygomycete fungi was demonstrated using antiserum to Aspergillus. However, it was not possible to distinguish between two Aspergillus species. A fumigatus and A. flavus with this technique. Pretreatment of sections with sodium azide and normal swine serum was effective in eliminating background staining. The method can be used to produce permanently stained sections and has applications in the recognition of hyphal fragments in tissue from infected patients.",1981,6168556,no
"Purification of an acidic alpha-D-mannosidase from Aspergillus saitoi and specific cleavage of 1,2-alpha-D-mannosidic linkage in yeast mannan.","An acidic alpha-D-mannosidase (alpha-D-mannoside mannohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.24) has been isolated from culture filtrate of Aspergillus saitoi. The extracellular alpha-mannosidase was homogeneous in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight of the enzyme was 51 000 and the isoelectric point pH 4.5. The purified enzyme has a pH optimum of 5.0, a Km of 0.45  mM with baker's yeast mannan and has no activity towards p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-mannoside. The mode of action of the enzyme has been studied with baker's yeast mannan and saké yeast mannan. The enzyme cleaves specifically the 1,2-alpha-linked side chain, producing free mannose.",1981,7011404,no
On the problem of nonsense correlations in allergological tests after routine extraction.,"The influence of extraction procedures and culturing methods of material used for the preparation of allergenic extracts on correlation patterns found in allergological testing (skin test and RAST) was investigated. In our laboratory a short extraction procedure performed at O degrees C was used for Aspergillus repens. A. penicilloides, Wallemia sebi, their rearing media and non-inoculated medium. For the commercially available extracts from house dust, house-dust mite, pollen of Dactylus glomerata and A. penicilloides a longer procedure (several days) performed at room temperature was used. Statistical analysis showed a separation of all test results into two clusters, each cluster being composed of correlations between extracts from only one the manufacturers did not show any correlation. The correlations found between the short time incubated extracts of the xerophilic fungi  and their rearing media could be explained by genetical and biochemical relationships between these fungi depending on ecological conditions. However, while the correlation found between house dust and house-dust mite is understandable, correlations found between long time incubated extracts from house-dust mite and D. glomerata or A. penicilloides may be nonsense correlations, that do not adequately describe the in vivo situation. The similarity of these extracts is presumably artificially created during extraction.",1981,7027777,no
An approach to fungal antigen relationships by radioallergosorbent test inhibition.,"Antigenic relationships among three species of Aspergillus (A. fumigatus, A. glaucus, and A. flavus) were examined by paired cross-radioallergosorbent test (RAST) inhibition analysis, an in vitro technique based on human IgE antibody specificity. Alternaria tenuis was found to be antigenically unrelated to each of the three species of Aspergillus and was used as a negative control. A single test serum yielded uninhibited RAST indices of 6, 7.4, 8.1, and 7.8 for A. fumigatus, A. glaucus, A. flavus, and Alternaria tenuis, respectively. At a concentration of 10 mg/ml, A. fumigatus inhibited A. glaucus RAST by 63% and A. flavus RAST by 62%. A. glaucus inhibited A. fumigatus RAST by 36% and A. flavus RAST by 63%. A. flavus inhibited A. fumigatus RAST by 44% and A. glaucus RAST by 81%. Each species of Aspergillus produced significant but only partial inhibition of RAST to each of the other two species analyzed. Results indicate the existence of both shared and unique antigens among these three species of Aspergillus. Paired cross-RAST inhibition may be used as an approach to study species relationships among genera of several classes of clinically relevant fungi. Unless many strains are employed, data obtained do not represent a definitive analysis of species, because of possible different degrees of inhibition by various strains of a particular species. They do, however, allow for the antigenic comparison of two or more crude, poorly characterized preparations thought to be important in human allergic disease.",1981,6161952,no
Pulmonary apical fibrocystic disease. A serologic study.,"Common aetiopathogenic factors were sought in 12 patients with progressive pulmonary apical fibrocystic changes, active human-type tuberculosis excluded. HLA-typing did not reveal any clear-cut trends only the three patients with ankylosing spondylitis or Reiter's disease were HLA-B27 positive. Six patients had HLA-Cw3, which exceeds the prevalence in referents, antibodies, as well as other tissue antibodies, were mainly negative so that autoimmune aetiology is not likely. Similarly, antimicrobial antibodies were found occasionally, while low-titred influenza antibodies were positive in all patients. Serum proteins, immunoglobulins, rheumatoid factor and C-reactive protein were suggestive of chronic inflammation, as were low positive titres of smooth muscle antibodies in nine patients. In spite of the uniform clinical picture and course of the disease, no uniform aetiopathogenic factors were found, but possible unidentified slow- and low-grade viral or fungal infection is discussed.",1981,6971763,no
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) caused by Aspergillus terreus: specific lymphocyte sensitization and antigen-directed serum opsonic activity.,"A 16-year-old male presented with a history of asthma and recurrent pneumonia. A diagnosis of ABPA was based upon the typical clinical presentation, peripheral eosinophilia, elevated IgE and positive immediate skin tests to Aspergillus. Sputum cultures grew A. terreus, a rare cause of human disease. Soluble and particulate antigens were prepared from this organism. Precipitins against A. terreus, but not against A. fumigatus, were detected in the patient's serum. His lymphocytes proliferated markedly in vitro when exposed to soluble A. terreus but not A. fumigatus antigen. The lymphocyte responses correlated with disease activity. Functional serum opsonic activity was measured using the technique of stimulated polymorphonuclear leucocyte chemiluminescence. The nonspecific opsonic activity of the patient's serum was within high normal range when zymosan was employed as an alternative pathway activator. Specific opsonic activity against particulate Aspergillus antigen was significantly increased in the patient's serum when compared with control sera. Despite the presence of specific antibody and opsonic activity against A. terreus, the patient's serum levels of C3, C4, and total hemolytic complement were normal. These findings are consistent with in vivo sequestration of the organism.",1981,6781385,no
TerELISA: the ELISA test performed in Terasaki plates.,"The use of Terasaki (10 microliter samples) and microtitration (100 microliter samples) plates as the solid phase in enzyme immunoassays was compared. Various antigens were used for coating the plates and antibodies present in human sera were evaluated using the same anti-human Ig antibody labelled with either beta -galactosidase, alkaline phosphatase, peroxidase or glucose oxidase. The results obtained, either by scoring with the naked eye or by absorbance reading with appropriate densitometers, showed that both plates were equally suitable and that the 4 enzymes were equally effective in detecting the same lowest quantity of antibody. A comparative evaluation using either Terasaki or microtitration plates for the quantitation of human anti-Echinococcus granulosus antibody ii 50 sera demonstrated that there was a good correlation between the two procedures (r = 0.8097). Finally, the use of glucose oxidase as the enzyme marked allowed a clear-cut distinction to be made between positive and negative samples with the naked eye alone.",1981,7031134,no
Detection of circulating antigen in experimental Candida albicans endocarditis by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.,"A double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed for the detection of circulating Candida albicans antigen during the course of experimental C. albicans endocarditis. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was positive in 75% of rabbits with polyethylene catheter-induced experimental aortic valve C. albicans endocarditis but was negative in all controls, including catheterized animals that received intravenous Candida or catheterized but uninfected animals, and in rabbits with experimental fungal or bacterial endocarditis of other etiologies. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was much more sensitive than blood culturing or fever determinations in experimental C. albicans endocarditis. This assay is more sensitive than currently available serological techniques, is highly specific, and deserves further study in the diagnosis of invasive, disseminated C. albicans infections, including endocarditis.",1980,7024298,no
IgA antibody against Aspergillus fumigatus antigen in patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"IgA antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) antigen were measured by a radioimmunoassay in sera from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and compared with IgA antibody levels in asthmatics who had positive prick tests to Af and normal controls. The assay for IgA antibody discriminated between both control groups and the ABPA group at two serum dilutions (10(-2) and 10(-3)) but did not discriminate all individual ABPA sera from the peak levels of antibody in the control groups. IgA antibody against Af may participate in the immunopathogenetics of pulmonary inflammation in some cases of ABPA and may be of some diagnostic value in some, but not all, cases.",1980,7008988,no
An application of ellipsometry. Assessment of polysaccharide and glycoprotein interaction with lectin at a liquid/solid interface.,"Lectins were specifically adsorbed from solution onto metallized glass slides coated with polysaccharide, glycopeptide and glycoprotein films. The degree of interaction was determined by measuring the thickness of the bound lectin layer with an ellipsometer after washing and drying the slide. The binding of concanavalin A (tetrameric) and succinyl concanavalin A (dimeric) to a yeast mannan film was studied as a function of lectin concentration, temperature, rinsing time and the extent of stirring of the slide. The maximum thickness of bound concanavalin A and succinyl concanavalin A was 11 amd 3.8 nm, respectively. The method permitted the measurement of the association constants for both lectins (1.0 x 10(7) M-1 for concanavalin A, 2 x 10(6) M-1 for succinyl concanavalin A) and the detection of 0.6 pmol concanavalin A. The same sensitivity was observed with anti-mannan antibodies. The binding of both lectins was shown to be specific using sugar haptens. When compared with methyl alpha-D-mannoside, the affinity of concanavalin A for D-mannose and D-glucose was 14 and 3%, respectively. A film of mucin glycopeptide (universal adsorbent) interacted similarly with concanavalin A, Ricinus communis I, soya bean and wheat germ lectins. However, films of glycoproteins such as fetuin, ceruloplasmin and Aspergillus niger beta-D-galactosidase interacted to different degrees with those lectins. The relative affinity of wheat germ agglutinin for N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and for chitin-derived oligosaccharides was also determined. When films of sialoglycoproteins were treated wih neuraminidase, the thickness of the bound peanut agglutinin layer increased. Although this method cannot determine quantitatively the sugar composition of the film, it permits rapid estimation of the interaction of lectins with polysaccharides and glycoproteins, using little material.",1980,7417529,no
The use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the diagnosis of farmer's lung.,"Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was adapted to measure antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus, Thermoactinomyces vulgaris and Micropolyspora faeni. Mycelial and culture fluid antigens were used separately to analyze antibodies in three study groups: farmer's lung patients, patients with bronchitis and healthy control persons. The mycelial antigen of A. fumigatus gave more positive results than the corresponding culture fluid antigen. The situation was reversed for the actinomycetes. For this reason either a mycelial antigen or a combination of mycelial and culture fluid antigens should be used in ELISA in routine tests. The prevalence and the titers of antibodies against the three microbes detected by ELISA were higher in the farmer's lung group than in the other two groups.",1980,7008641,no
An immunoanalysis for kojic acid.,"An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for the analysis of kojic acid in aqueous solutions and biological fluids. As little as 100 pg kojic acid ml-1 was detected in standard buffer. Analysis of biological fluids containing 1 mg kojic acid ml-1 showed that ELISA could detect the toxin at dilutions of 10(-4) in urine, deporteinated plasma, or serum. Urine and plasma samples collected form rabbits dosed intravenously with 56 mg kojic acid kg-1 body weight gave positive tests at dilutions of 10(-4). The immunoassay described may be used for detection of kojic acid produced during experimental or clinical aspergillosis.",1980,7001651,no
"Pollen and mold survey of Baghdad, Iraq.","There are few known adequate or accurate pollen surveys of the various climates of the Middle East. Certain of these countries, such as Iraq and Iran, have tested alleged ""hay fever plants"" but such surveys have been primitive and are based on searching for the families of hay fever plants of other nations within their boundaries. No sophisticated studies exist. This study is the result of a recent visit to Baghdad where the authors performed an admittedly rough plant survey, particularly identifying the flora indigenous to the area. Subsequently a roughly spaced mod survey was undertaken. The authors hope that a thorough pollen survey will eventually be made in these countries to enable physicians to better care for their allergic patients.",1980,7406254,no
Circulating immune complexes in bronchial asthma.,"Soluble immune complexes were detected by a sold phase Clq binding assay in forty-two out of 106 well studied asthmatic patients (39.6%) and in eleven out of 145 age-matched controls (8% P < 0.01). Clinical significance of immune complexes has been evaluated by comparing the following parameters in patients with and without such complexes: age, sex, duration of disease, IgE-mediated allergy (RAST, skin test), precipitins (Aspergillus, Candida albicans, Thermoactinomycetes), corticodependency, lung function tests, associated symptoms (hivernal bronchitis, urticaria, eczema,...), desenstization treatment, serum concentration in immunoglobulin in G, A, M and E. Immune complexes were found more frequently in female than in male patients. The prevalence of immune complexes was higher in patients treated by hyposensitization therapy and in cases with precipitating antibodies against thermophilic actinomycetes and Aspergillus.",1980,7449074,no
Immediate type hypersensitivity to common moulds. Comparison of different diagnostic materials.,"Extracts of five common atmospheric moulds (Alternaria, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Mucor and Penicillium) obtained from different manufacturers were compared by means of skin prick testing and, partly, with the radioallergosorbent test. Considerable differences were found between the extracts with respect to positive tests found in mould-allergic individuals and controls. A purified allergen preparation of Cladosporium herbarum was superior to the crude allergen extracts. The results suggest that the allergen contents of the extract differed both with respect to total allergenic potency and to allergenic composition.",1980,7192501,no
"Standardization of allergen extracts by inhibition of RAST, skin test, and chemical composition.","Five allergen extracts of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Lolium perenne, Alternaria tenuis, Aspergillus fumigatus and Cladosporium herbarum, obtained from four different manufacturers, were examined by inhibition of RAST, content of protein and carbohydrate, contents of phosphorylcholine (Pc) and tridacnin reactive components, and by skin test. Inhibition of RAST was used as a primary method for establishing allergenic potency and demonstrated wide variations for each preparation supplied by the different manufacturers. The extracts also varied widely in protein and carbohydrate content and in the ratio of these parameters, indicating internal heterogeneity. Pc content was significantly related to RAST potency for extracts of A. fumigatus and A. tenuis, suggesting that Pc content may be used as a primary standarization procedure for these extracts. Skin test reactions undertaken at a single concentration did not show any significant variation in weal size between preparations of a given allergen extract. However, of particular importance to practising clinicians is the finding that varying numbers of patients showed negative skin reactions to one preparation of a particular allergen yet were positive to the corresponding preparations supplied by the other companies.",1980,7004662,no
Antigenemia detected by radioimmunoassay in systemic aspergillosis.,"Because of difficulties in antemortem diagnosis of systemic aspergillosis, a radioimmunoassay to an Aspergillus fumigatus carbohydrate was developed and evaluated in patients with mycotic or bacterial infections. Antigenemia was detected in sera obtained antemortem from four of seven patients with systemic aspergillosis and in pleural fluid from an Aspergillus empyema but not in control sera or pleural fluid from 43 patients or 27 normal donors. When characterized with reference to onset of disease, antigenemia was an early sign of infection. This study shows the usefulness of the Aspergillus antigen radioimmunoassay for early, specific immunodiagnosis of systemic aspergillosis.",1980,7387020,no
Antigenemia detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in rabbits with systemic candidiasis.,"To aid in the rapid, accurate, and early diagnosis of systemic and invasive Candida infections, a double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed for the detection of circulating Candida antigens. The sensitivity for purified mannan was 0.1 to 1 ng/ml. No reactivity was seen with a variety of other fungal and bacterial antigen preparations. The assay was evaluated in normal or immunosuppressed rabbits with varying degrees of systemic candidiasis. All rabbits given infecting doses of 10(7) or 10(8) organisms were positive for Candida antigens with increasing titers until death. Rabbits given 10(6) organisms were variably and transiently positive. All control infected and uninfected rabbits were negative. This sensitive and specific technique detects Candida antigens in the serum of infected rabbits before widespread organ involvement occurs and should prove extremely valuable in the early diagnosis of systemic candidiasis.",1980,7381300,no
Fatal pulmonary psittacosis and aspergillosis. Case report of dual infection.,"A 59-year-old man in previously good health had acute, progressive bronchopneumonia and died after a three-week course of illness, despite treatment with various antibiotics. Serologic, microbiologic, and histologic findings indicated infection with both Chlamydia psittaci and Aspergillus fumigatus. Disseminated, invasive aspergillosis sometimes is a complication of chronic respiratory disease, malignancy, or other deficiency of host defenses, but to our knowledge, this is the first report of psittacosis as a coincidental, probably predisposing disease.",1980,7396594,no
Serologic immunodiagnosis of of invasive aspergillosis.,"Two sensitive methods, counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), for detecting antibodies to Aspergilus were used to study serial specimens from patients with histologically proven invasive aspergillosis for measurement of conversion from negative to positive immunoprecipitin reactions and changes in ELISA titers during immunosuppression. Sera from 12 granulocytopenic patients without invasive aspergillosis served as controls. Positive CIE reactions were demonstrated in 70% of patients with clinically suspected aspergillosis. In addition to a greater sensitivity (80%) of ELISA, the serial determination of antibody response by Elisa allowed for separation of seropositive patients into two groups. A serial rise in ELISA titer appeared to correlate with histologically documented recovery from infection, whereas those with declining or persistently intermediate titers were found to have disseminated aspergillosis at autopsy. Thus, serial antibody determination by ELISA was valuable as both a diagnostic and prognostic tool.",1980,6989934,no
Serodiagnosis of Aspergillus fumigatus antibody in migratory ducks.,Migrating duck populations in Wisconsin were evaluated during a one-year period for exposure to Aspergillus fumigatis by two serodiagnostic methods: immunodiffusion and countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis. Peak antibody reactivity to sporulating culture extracts of the fungus was detected in serum samples collected in winter. Antibody levels did not differ between male and female or adult and juvenile populations.,1980,6776945,no
Conjugation of enzymes to immunoglobulins using dimaleimides.,"A method is described for coupling enzymes to immunoglobulins using sulphydryl derivatives of the proteins and a dimaleimide which is relatively water-soluble. Parameters affecting the performance of the conjugates have been examined including level of sulphydryl incorporation, ratio of enzyme/immunoglobulin and nature of dimaleimide used. Peroxidase-immunoglobulin conjugates made by the dimaleimide method have been compared with those made by the periodate oxidation method and found to have a superior performance. Immunoglobulin has been linked to peroxidase (horseradish peroxidase, EC 1.11.1.7), glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger, (EC 1.1.3.4), penicillinase from Bacillus cereus beta-lactamase I (EC 3.5.2.6), and beta-galactosidase from Escherichia coli (EC 3.2.1.23).",1980,6988011,no
Intracavitary amphotereicin B in the treatment of symptomatic pulmonary aspergillomas.,"The optimal treatment of pulmonary aspergillomas is not established. Surgical resection is often impossible because of severe, underlying pulmonary impairment, and medical treatment has given negative or inconclusive results. Six patients with symptomatic pulmonary aspergillomas were treated with percutaneous instillation of intracavitary amphotericin B. Four patients who received the full course of therapy showed improvement and stabilization or reversal of progressive roentgenographic changes. Also, follow-up serologic studies of Aspergillus spp. precipitins were obtained in three and were negative. One patient did not tolerate this treatment because of repeated systemic reactions. Another patient did not respond clinically or roentgenographically. Intracavitary amphotericin B therapy should be considered in patients with symptomatic pulmonary aspergilloma, particularly when surgical resection is not feasible.",1980,7361807,no
Antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus in farmers' lung patients measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).,"Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure antibodies against Aspergillus fumigatus in farmers' lung patients, various other pulmonary diseases and healthy controls. Both the prevalence and the mean titre of antibodies were significantly higher in farmers' lung patients than in the other groups. There was no difference between controls and patients with bronchial asthma or non-allergic pulmonary diseases. On the other hand, in the group of patients with respiratory diseases of undefined aetiology the mean antibody titre was significantly higher than that of the controls. Comparison of ELISA and the precipitin test showed the higher sensitivity of ELISA, but otherwise the two tests were in a close agreement.",1980,6993041,no
"Atopic allergy, serum IgE and RAST specific IgE antibodies in patients with cystic fibrosis.","The occurrence of allergic diseases is studied in a group of 56 Swiss children suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF). 27% of CF children showed allergic manifestations, and 61% of CF children had positive family history for atopic diseases. The occurrence of allergies is increased in homozygotes as well as in heterozygotes for CF. Total serum IgE values are clearly increased in atopic CF children, but also slightly elevated in CF patients without allergic manifestations.

Sero-diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis: attempts to determine antigen and antibody relevance to infection.,"Attempt was made to define antigens and antisera which might prove useful in diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in man. A convalescent antiserum (serum from rabbits after liver infection with Aspergillus fumigatus conidia) which might be more representative of immunological reaction to fungal growth in vivo, did not react in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with commerical antigens which are used at present in attempts to detect antibody response in systemic infections in man. However, this convalescent antiserum reacted with antigens from a range of fungal extracts. Antigens from young culture filtrates in particular the 24th culture filtrate are advocated as the standard antigens for antibody detection using conventional immunoprecipitation techniques. For the detection of circulating antigens, the use of convalescent antiserum in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay might be promising in the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.",1980,6990268,no
Demonstration and quantification oomycosis.,"Using a radioimmunoassay technique, we have determined the total IgE concentration and specific IgE antibody level against Paracoccidioides brasiliensis in the sera of patients with mycologically confirmed active paracoccidioidcosis. Patients with aspergilloma, or individuals with antibodies against Cadida albicans, and sera of apparently healthy individuals from the endemic area were also examined. The level of total IgE was significantly elevated in 9 out of 10 cases of paracoccidioidomycosis. The mean level of specific IgE against P. brasiliensis was significantly higher in the serum of the patients in comparison with control individuals. The percentage of specific IgE relative to the total varied from 0.38 to 2.28%. The differences between IgE levels in pare other mycoses were statistically significant. Our results suggest a possible involvement of specific IgE antibodies against P. brasiliensis in the immune response of patients with paracoccidioidomycosis. The hyperimmunoglobulinemia E may be related to the T-cell defect that characterizes the severe forms of the disease.",1980,7390639,no
Detection of candida antigenemia in human invasive candidiasis by a new solid phase radioimmunoassay.,"There is a continuing need to develop reliable non-invasive methods to aid in the early diagnosis of disseminatyed candidiasis. We report the development of a solid phase ""sandwich"" radioimmunoassay (RIA) for the detection of soluble cytoplasmic protein antigens (SPA) of Candida albicans in patients with systemic candidiasis. SPA were prepared by ultrasonic disruption of blastospores of C. albicans. Anti-SPA IgG was covalently linked to a solid phase of polyacrylamide-like microspheres. Standard amounts of patient sample or SPA in pooled normal human serum were reacted with the conjugated microspheres, washed and reacted with anti-SPA IgG-125I. The amount of antigen was directly correlated with the amount of bound 125I-IgG anti-SPA. In a retrospective analysis, circulating SPA in the range of 0.5-1.6 microgram/ml was detected in the serum of 12 of 19 patients (63%) with documented systemic candidiasis. There was no detectable SPA in the serum of 20 hospitalized patients with bacteremia, two patients with aspergillosis, one with cryptococcosis, and three with invasive Candida tropicalis. We observed no crossreaction of the RIA with mannan from C. albicans, coccidioidin or culture filtrate antigen of Aspergillus fumigatus. There was significant inhibition of the RIA by serum samples from two patients with chronic candidiasis suggestive of anti-SPA antibody excess. The solid phase RIA to detect circulating SPA can provide a useful noninvasive method for the diagnosis of systemic C. albicans infection.",1980,6997211,no
"A notable Aspergillus from a mortal aspergilloma of the lung. New aspects of the epidemiology, serodiagnosis and taxonomy of Aspergillus fumigatus.","Different basic mycological observations were made in relation to a fatal case of aspergilloma of the lung in a 45-year-old male. Cultural examination of the sputum and autopsy material from the lung revealed the predominant presence of a white fungus along with a scarce growth of the typical Aspergillus fumigatus. The white isolate produced conidial heads almost similar to that of A. fumigatus but with apparent septation in the phialides. With the help of the immunodiffusion test and use of the antigens from the typical A. fumigatus strain and from the white isolate, antibodies could be detected in the serum of this patient and an antigenetic relationship between these fungi could be observed. It is assumed that this white isolate is a variant of A. fumigatus and its presence in the lung is an indication of chronic or progressed aspergillosis caused by A. fumigatus. Cultural characteristics and developmental morphology of this fungus and the serodiagnostic value of the antigen derived from it will be described in detail in separate communications.",1980,6779440,no
Immune complexes and humoral response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis.,"We studied the humoral immune status of 51 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) as compared to 25 patients with other respiratory diseases (RD). CF patients had higher serum concentrations of IgG and IgA (p less than 0.001), C5, and CH50 (p less than 0.05), than did RD patients. Twenty-three % of CF patients had increased IgE concentrations. Of 32 CF and 1 RD patients colonized with mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), 91% had serum precipitins to PA, whereas no precipients were found in patients not colonized with mucoid PA. Fifty-one % of CF patients had circulating immune complexes detected by 125I-C1q binding (for CF patients mean values +/- SD, 14.5 +/- 12% versus 7.5 +/- 3.4% for RD patients p less than 0.005). Complexes were correlated with higher serum IgA concentrations but not other immunoglobulins, complement components, response to PA, or pulmonary function at time of assay. Extra vascular formation of complexes was suggested by uniform absence of plasma C3 activation in vivo.",1980,6766286,no
Immunodiagnosis of systemic candidiasis: mannan antigenemia detected by radioimmunoassay in experimental and human infections.,"A radioimmunoassay (RIA) that detects candida mannan was developed so that immunodiagnosis of systemic candidiasis could be improved. The RIA was evaluated in an animal model of disseminated disease and in a panel of patient sera. Mannan antigenemia was detected with the RIA in 52% of 29 rabbits with systemic candidasis, but not in 60 normal rabbits or 31 rabbits with systemic aspergillosis. In an evaluation of human sera, mannan antigenemia was detected in five of 11 patients with systemic candidiasis, one of three patients with invasive gastrointestinal candidiasis, and one patient with a sustained candidemia associated with an infected intravenous catheter. Mannan was not detected in sera from 11 patients with superficial candida infections, seven patients colonized with Candida, three patients with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, eight patients with other systemic mycoses, or 22 normal donors. This study demonstrates the utility of this RIA for early, specific immunodiagnosis of invasive candidiasis.",1979,94341,no
A solid-phase radioimmunoassay for the measurement of antibody to Aspergillus in invasive aspergillosis.,"A solid-phase radioimmunoassay (SPRIA) to measure antibody responses to Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus flavus antigens in invasive aspergillosis (IA) was developed and compared with immunodiffusion (ID) and counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE). SPRIA detected significant elevations in levels of aspergillus antibody in 15 (79)% of 19 patients with IA. Fewer patients with IA were positive by ID (give of 19) or CIE (four of 19). Only seven )8%) of 58 subjects with other fungal or bacterial infections were positive by SPRIA, as was one (5%) of 20 by ID and CIE. Weak cross-reactivity between aspergillus and candida antigens was demonstrated by SPRIA. IgG levels in patients with IA and control subjects were equivalent. Thus, an antibody response to Aspergillus can be detected in a greater percentage of patients with IA by SPRIA than by ID or CIE. Although a few patients without aspergillosis had elevated levels of aspergillus antibody, a rise in antibody level was specific for IA.",1979,118999,no
Clinical correlations between long-term (IgE) and short-term (IgG S-TS) anaphylactic antibodies in atopic and 'non-atopic' subjects with respiratory allergic disease.,"The sera of atopic and non-atopic persons with allergic pulmonary disorders were examined for long-term sensitizing, IgE and short-term sensitizing heat-stable (S-TS) antibodies which were present separately or together in the sera of some patients sensitive to antigens such as budgerigar serum proteins and Aspergillus funigatus. In fourteen atopic patients with extrinsic asthma, six had both types of antibody to common allergens, and of nine non-atopic patients with crytogenic (intrinsic) asthma, four had only heat-stable short-term sensitizing antibodies. The sera of atopic subjects with type I prick test reactions and positive RAST's, showed specific IgE antibody by baboon PCA tests to budgerigar serum proteins, A. funigatus, Timothy grass pollen extract and hen egg extract, and not to Dermatophagoides farinae, possibly because of naturally occurring mite antibodies in the baboon. The sera of non-atopic asthmatics, who had given negative prick test but positive immediate, dual or late intracutaneous tests, and only late asthmatic reactions, contained precipitins in most cases and gave little or no RAST reaction. On baboon PCA these sera contained either, S-TS antibody alone, or S-TS plus long-term sensitizing antibody, or long-term sensitizing antibody alone. Some of the sera with long-term sensitizing antibody contained blocking antibody which could diffuse away in the 24 hr delay for the baboon PCA test and could also be responsible for the negative RAST. Tests with insoluble anti-IgE immuno-adsorbents on two sera from persons sensitive to aspergillus confirmed that the S-TS activity was not due to IgE, and on two sera with negative RAST and negative prick tests to budgerigar serum antigens confirmed that the 24 hr monkey PCA responses were due to IgE.",1979,117951,no
Demonstration of antigenemia in patients with invasive aspergillosis by solid phase (protein A-rich Staphylococcus aureus) radioimmunoassay.,"A solid phase radioimmunoassay (RIA) was used to detect Aspergillus antigenemia in three patients, two with autopsy proved disseminated aspergillosis and one with a suspected infection. These RIA studies suggest that screening for antigenemia may be a specific and sensitive diagnostic test for disseminated aspergillosis.",1979,495632,no
Galactomannan antigenemia in invasive aspergillosis.,"Galactomannan (GM) extracted from mycelia of Aspergillus fumigatus with cold dilute alkali reacted with antiserum specific for an antigen that circulated in invasive aspergillosis in rabbits and humans. The GM was purified by its affinity for concanavalin A and was separated from a nonantigenic glucan by gel permeation on Sephacryl S-200. The GM molecular weight of between 25,000 to 75,000 was smaller than the antigen present in infected rabbit serum which was retained by an ultrafiltration membrane that had a nominal molecular weight limit of 125,000. The ratio of galactose to mannose present in GM was 1:1.17. The serological activity of GM was stable to boiling but labile to 0.01 N HCl, implicating galactofuranose as an antigenic determinant. Analysis of purified GM by methylation-gas chromatography suggested a structure consisting of a 1 leads to 6-linked mannan backbone with oligogalactoside side chains 3 units long, terminating in galactofuranose. The presence of mannose as a side chain component was also inferred. Another antigen of A. fumigatus, which did not bind to concanavalin A, was isolated after tandem chromatography on diethylaminoethyl- and carboxymethyl-Sephadex and was identified as a galactan. The galactan inhibited the immune precipitation of GM was specific antiserum.",1979,383620,no
Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgG and IgE antibodies to protein and polysaccharide antigens of Aspergillus fumigatus.,"ELISA has emerged as a useful alternative to other more costly and complex tests. Polystyrene microhaemagglutination plates have been used as solid phase to absorb Aspergillus fumigatus protein and polysaccharide components for detection of specific antibodies in patients with various forms of pulmonary aspergillosis. IgG and IgE antibodies to the polysaccharide as well as the protein allergens have been found. For the IgE test a double antibody technique has been developed, which is more sensitive than the conventional indirect ELISA.",1979,113131,no
Detection of circulating antigen of Aspergillus fumigatus in sera of mice and rabbits by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.,"Circulating antigen of Aspergillus fumigatus was demonstrated in the sera of experimentally infected, cortisone-treated mice and rabbits by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (micro-ELISA), confirming earlier results where fungal antigen had been detected by counter-immunoelectrophoresis (CIE). Peaks of detection of circulating antigen by CIE and micro-ELISA in mice were not simultaneous suggesting that the nature of the predominant antigens may have altered during the course of infection. CIE failed to detect fungal antigen in infected rabbits whereas micro-ELISA monitored antigenemia until death. Both CIE and micro-ELISA demonstrated the rapid clearance of intravenously inoculated Aspergillus-antigen from the rabbit circulation.",1979,384254,no
A new method of allergen standardization. Passive cutaneous anaphylaxis inhibition in a mouse-to-rat system in comparison with other methods.,"Various methods have been employed for standardization of potency of allergen extracts. We used passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) inhibition in a mouse-to-rat system as a new means of standardization. Several allergen extracts, including mite, short ragweed, house dust, Aspergillus, Candida, and Japanese cedar, were examined. Mouse IgE antibodies were produced after two or three injections of antigen and alum. The potency measured by PCA inhibition in the mouse-to-rat system was compared with that of protein nitrogen (PN) content, end point of prick test in humans, and 50% radioallergosorbent test (RAST) inhibition. Our studies suggest that the mouse-to-rat system could be used to determine allergenic potency and to standardize allergen extracts.",1979,429715,no
Demonstration of antigenemia by radioimmunoassay in rabbits experimentally infected with Aspergillus.,"Antigens were detected in the blood of rabbits infected with Aspergillus fumigatus by a solid-phase (tube) radioimmunoassay (RIA). The radiolabel for the assay was a polysaccharide-rich alkali extract (APAE) from the mycelia of A. fumigatus. Before this extract could be suitable labeled with 125I, it had to be conjugated with tyramine. Rabbits immunized with heat-killed mycelia had titers of antibody in serum of as high as 1:38,000 against this radiolabeled antigen. With unlabeled and unconjugated APAE as the standard antigen, the sensitivity of the RIA was 12 ng per test, or 500 ng/ml. Antigenemia was detectable by RIA three days after infection of rabbits with A. fumigatus. Blood cultures taken concomitantly were uniformly negative. These results indicate that antigenemia occurs in invasive aspergillus infection and in such cases can be detected by RIA. These observations may be important in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillus infections in humans.",1979,376756,no
Specific IgE antibodies to platinum salts in sensitized workers.,"A RAST has been developed for the measurement of IgE antibodies specific to platinum chloride complexes in sensitized workers. Human serum albumin covalently linked to Sepharose beads by the cyanogen bromide method was reacted with ammonium tetrachloroplatinite (II) (NH4)2PtCl4. This conjugate was more suitable for the RAST, than conjugates of HSA and the platinum salt prepared in solution and then linked to the activated Sepharose, showing better sensitivity and giving lower levels of non-specific uptake of IgE from sera of non-exposed subjects with high total levels of IgE, e.g. allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillotics.",1979,87284,no
The occurrence and treatment of false positive reactions in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for the presence of fungal antigens in clinical samples.,"Non-specific positive reactions have been revealed in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) of sera for the presence of fungal antigen. These false positives were recognized by their occurrence in tests for both Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus antigens and by their response to dithiothreitol, combined with their reaction with non-immune rabbit globulin. A scheme is proposed which differentiates between true and false positive reactions. Use of fractionated anti-fungal globulin in conjugates reduced the incidence of false positive results in sera from hospitalized patients and eliminated them from sera of healthy subjects. The test scheme was applied to two panels of sera containing samples from patients with (a) invasive candidosis and (b) invasive aspergillosis. The relevance of ELISA tests for the detection of fungal antigen in human serum is discussed.",1979,469266,no
Non-specific potentiation of IgE by parasitic infections in man.,"Infection with the helminthic parasites Ascaris lumbricoides and/or Necator americanus (hookworm) induces the production in man of high levels of serum IgE. The specificity of this IgE antibody when measured by RAST to a wide range of allergens was restricted in general to the helminthic antigens. Absorption of the sera with immunosorbents produced by coupling extracts of A. lumbricoides to CNBr activated Sepharose 4B established that Ascaris antigen specific IgE antibodies contributed a minor fraction of the total serum IgE. These observations suggest that parasitic infections in man as in laboratory animals potentiate the production of high levels of IgE with specificity unrelated to that of the parasite antigens. While the specificity of this potentiated IgE was not established, it is not directed towards inhalant allergens.",1979,370030,no
Immunodiagnosis of systemic aspergillosis. I. Antigenemia detected by radioimmunoassay in experimental infection.,"Because systemic aspergillosis is difficult to diagnose ante mortem, a study to improve immunodiagnosis was undertaken in a rabbit model of disseminated infection. We found that the predominant humoral response of infected animals was directed against four Aspergillus antigens identified by crossed immunoelectrophoresis. One of these antigens, a cell-wall carbohydrate, was purified by gel-filtration chromatography and was used to develop a radioimmunoassay. The sensitivity of this assay was increased by testing for serum-bound antigen as well as for free antigen. When the sensitivity of the RIA was evaluated in the animal model, antigenemia was detected in 78% of 51 rabbits with disseminated infection and ante morten in 85% of 42 rabbits with lethal infection. By contrast, with immunoprecipitin analysis only eight of 51 rabbits were positive for antigen, and six of 51 rabbits were positive for Aspergillus antibody. The specificity of the RIA was also tested. Negative controls for antigen included sera from 76 normal rabbits and sera from 25 rabbits with systemic candidiasis. The Candida control group is pertinent because 48% of these rabbits had specific Candida antigenemia detected by a mannan RIA. This study demonstrates that Aspergillus antigenemia occurs during the course of experimental disseminated aspergillosis and illustrates the potential of an Aspergillus antigen RIA for sensitive, specific immunodiagnosis of human infections.",1979,366048,no
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis caused by Aspergillus ochraceus.,"A case with the characteristics of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is described. The species of Aspergillus involved, A. ochraceus, has not previously been found in this disorder. The organism had antigenic properties distinct from five other species of Aspergillus most commonly associated with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. The patient had immediate skin test, immunodiffusion, and radioallergosorbent reactivity to the species. Four per cent of 112 serum samples from others suspected of having allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis had precipitins to A. ochraceus only.

"Characterization of antigens from Aspergillus fumigatus. II. Fractionation and electrophoretic, immunologic, and biologic activity.","Mycelial extracts of Aspergillus fumigatus grown in completely synthetic medium were fractionated by precipitation with ammonium sulfate, by ion-exchange chromatography, and by gel filtration. The fractions were characterized chemically, by analytic polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and by tests for serologic and biologic activity. The distribution of the antigens in the fractions was determined by double diffusion in gel and fused-rocket immunoelectrophoresis. Activity greater than that of the parent mycelial extract serologically, in guinea pig skin tests, and in in vitro lymphocyte transformation was observed with one fraction that was found in the 75 per cent ammonium sulfate precipitable portion and was eluted early by gel filtration. Another ammonium sulfate-precipitable component and one that was not precipitable at 75 per cent ammonium sulfate, but was firmly bound by ion-exchange columns, was found to have activity equal to unfractionated mycelial extract. These fractions were also active by a radioallergosorbent test for IgE. A carbohydrate component comprising almost 40 per cent of mycelial extract was found to be devoid of any immunologic activity.",1978,101104,no
Defective neutrophil locomotion in human blastomycosis: evidence for a serum inhibitor.,"Unstimulated or stimulated locomotion, bactericidal, and metabolic activities of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) from 12 nonimmunosuppressed patients with invasive fungal infections proved by culture, were evaluated before and after treatment of the patients with antimicrobial drugs. The major observation was that PMN from patients with blastomycosis had a defect in stimulated locomotion. The specificity of the defect for blastomycosis was substantiated by the normal stimulated locomotion of PMN from uninfected control subjects or untreated patients with histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, coccidioidomycosis, or sporotrichosis. The defect was due to a heat-stable, cell-directed, reversible serum inhibitor. In unheated or heated serum from untreated patients with blastomycosis, control PMN had decreased stimulated locomotion. Multiple washing followed by addition of control serum corrected locomotion of PMN from untreated patients with blastomycosis. The abnormality was not present in PMN from patients who had been treated with amphotericin B or had spontaneous resolution of their infections. Inhibition was not due to absence of chemoattractant activity because zymosan-activated patient serum or mixtures of patient and control serum stimulated PMN locomotion normally. The defect did not correlate with age, sex, neutrophil count, nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, serologic reactivity, or duration or severity of infection. No defect was found in bactericidal or metabolic activities of various combinations of PMN and serum from untreated or treated patients with blastomycosis or the 4 other fungal infections tested, indicating that the inhibitor was specific for stimulated locomotion.",1978,697183,no
Serum IgE and IgG antibody activity against Aspergillus fumigatus as a diagnostic aid in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.,"Serum IgE and IgG antibody activity against Aspergillus fumigatus was measured in 3 groups of subjects by 2 different immunologic methods. Group A consisted of 23 patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). Group B was composed of 19 patients with extrinsic asthma who had marked immediate type skin reactivity to A. fumigatus (prick skin test, 3 or 4+) but no other manifestation of ABPA. Group C, the control group, was composed of 12 healthy subjects. Two immunological methods, including a solid-phase polystyrene tube radioimmunoassay and an iodine-125-labeled, A. fumigatus antigen radioimmunoassay, were used to study each patient's serum sample, so as to demonstrate IgE antibody activity against A. fumigatus (IgE-Af) and IgG antibody activity against A. fumigatus (IgG-Af). Both IgE-Af and IgG-Af were significantly greater among patients in Group A than among those in Group B and Group C, as measured by both methods (P is less than 0.001). The results of this study suggest that either method can be used as a diagnostic aid for ABPA. These methods may provide a laboratory test permitting diagnosis of ABPA in its early stages before bronchial or pulmonary destruction occurs.",1978,350109,no
[Immunodiffusion tests in gel media with the addition of polyethyleneglycol 6000 for the serodiagnosis of mycoses].,"Different immunodiffusion techniques with and without the addition of polyetilenglycol 6000 (PEG), were studied to determine its effect on the sensitivity of these reactions. One hundred thirteen sera from patients who suffered or had suffered deep mycoses (paracoccidioidomycosis: 49, histoplasmosis: 25, aspergillosis: 25, candidiasis: 8 and coccidioidomycosis: 6) were examined by the quantitative Ouchterlony's immunodiffusion procedure. Regular medium and media with 2% and 4% PEG were used. Eighty two out of the one hundred thirteen sera were positive for the regular medium and 91 for the medium containing 2% of PEG furthermore, an increase of 1 or 2 two fold dilutions in the titers was observed in 40% of the sera, for the later media. Twenty one sera from aspergillosis cases were examined by agarose gel immunoelectrophoresis, 80% had more precipitin bands in the medium with 2% of PEG. Thirty four serum samples of patients suffering aspergillosis, paracoccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis were studied using the agarose electroosmophoresis with the secondary immunodiffusion test. An increase in the number of the anodic bands were observed in 55% while 64% presented more catodic bands, when the PEG medium was used. This results would indicate that the addition of 2% PEG 6000 to the regular medium improves the sensitivity of the immunodiffusion tests for mycoses.",1978,116327,no
[Significance of the radioallergosorbent test (RAST) in the specific diagnosis of atopic bronchial asthma (author's transl)].,"The radioallergosorbent test (RAST) is a recently developed radioimmunological in-vitro method for determining IgE-specific serum antibodies in reaginic allergy. There was 63.4% overall correspondence between RAST and bronchial provocation test in 423 tests with a total of eight perennial allergens on adults with asthma. Where there was disagreement, combination of postiive inhalation test and a negative RAST was much more frequent (33.6%) than in the obverse (3%). Agreement between RAST and provocation tests was 79% for the house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, 71.5% for cat and dog epithelium, 70% for the Penicillium mould, 63% for Alternaria, 55% for Hormodendron and Aspergillus and only 53% for house dust. In asthmatics a positive RAST usually indicates clinically relevant sensitization (positive case history or positive provacation test), while negative results (especially in cases of mould or house dust allergy) do not rule out possible significant sensitization. On the other hand, skin tests with moulds and house dust are frequently ""false"" positive. First test in the specific diagnosis of bronchial asthma remains a thorough case history combined with careful skin testing. When the two disagree, RAST is helpful together with as a ""secondary"" allergy test.",1978,639694,no

Intra- and postoperative, morphologic and serologic data.","In ten specimens of resected pulmonary tissue, a little known and underscribed form of aspergillosis called tumor-like blocked pulmonary cavity with liquid content infected with aspergilli was observed. This designation was based on the finding in the specimens of tumor-like cavitary structures with blocked bronchus and contents from which abundant growth of aspergillus fumigatus was invariably obtained in cultures. Nine of the ten specimens were bronchiectasis, and one was a bronchogenic cyst. The scant literature was review, emphasizing features characteristic of this form of mycetoma and differences from the typical and frequently encountered form of ordinary pulmonary aspergilloma. The serologic response and its long duration were attributed to biological properties of aspergilli in this form caused by inaccessibility of oxygen and by occlusion of the bronchial lumen.",1978,389368,no
[A critical study of immuno-enzymatic reactions coupled with the precipitation tests on cellulose acetate membranes].,"Precipitating tests carried out on cellulose acetate membrane can be increased by treating the immune complexes with enzyme linked anti-immunoglobulin antibodies. From our trials in parastic diseases (Amoebiasis, schistosomiasis, fasciolasis, filariasis, hydatidosis, trichinosis) and mycosis (Aspergillosis, Candidiasis), it seems that the immuno-enzymatic labelling of the ""active"" precipitating reactions should only be taken in consideration. We must insit on the importance of ELIEDA (enzyme-linked-immuno-electrodiffusion-assay) and ELIDEPA (enzyme-linked-immuno-double-electro-phoresis-assay). Both of these analytical assays are particularly sensitive. The sequence of appearance of the multiple precipitating systems of the complex parasitic mosaic can easily be watched. The different classes of immunoglobulins and their kinetics are determined by the use of monospecific antibodies linked to different enzymes which give a polychromic specific staining.",1978,369730,no
"Specific IgE estimations by RAST in Japanese asthmatics compared with skin, passive transfer and bronchial provocation tests.","198 asthmatics and twenty healthy persons were studied by RAST and in vivo tests with four common inhalant allergens. (a) Higher RAST classes were elicited with mite (Dermatophagoides farinae) extract and lower classes with other allergens. The agreement between positive RAST and skin or P-K tests was highest with the mite extract. RAST sensitivity was dependent on the kinds of allergens and was most sensitive to mite extract. Positive RAST was most closely related to the prick test reactions. (b) RASTs to house dust and mite extract were examined in terms of the threshold dosage of house dust and also the types of bronchial response (early, dual and late) induced by a certain amount of house dust higher RAST classes were found in subjects with bronchial response to the dual or early type, elicited by a threshold dosage of diluted extract, while lower RAST classes were found in cases of the late-type response elicited by the threshold dosage of concentrated extract. (c) Changes in IgE antibodies to house dust and mite extract were estimated in patients with positive house dust provocation. A greater increase occurred in cases of dual or early response, a smaller increase in those with a late response. Despite discordances in skin tests and RAST between house dust and mite extracts, the increases in IgE antibodies to mite extracts as well as house dust were observed in all cases, presumably caused by an allergenic identity between the allergens.",1978,348345,no
Precipitating factors in respiratory allergic disease in Indonesian children.,Skin test results and IgE antibody levels measured by RAST indicate that hypersensitivity to house dust mite (D. pteronyssinus) is a major feature of asthma and allergic rhinitis in Indonesian children. Total serum IgE levels were higher in the allergic than in control children. 60% (twenty-one out of thirty-five) of the asthmatic children and 56% (five out of nine) of the children with allergic rhinitis had IgE antibodies to the helminth Ascaris lumbricoides compared with none out of four control children. A tendency was found for high IgE antibody levels to D. pteronyssinus to occur in association with low IgE antibody levels to A. lumbricoides and vice versa.,1978,348344,no
"A trial of isolating a tumor-like form of pulmonary cavities infected with aspergilli. 1. Preoperative data, diagnostic difficulties.","A retrospective analysis was made of the case histories, clinical course and results of auxiliary examinations in 10 patients with tumor-like lung shadows, which preoperatively were suspected of aspergilloma, tuberculoma, malignant tumor or ""tumor"". The postoperative diagnosis being known, the preoperative diagnosis difficulties were analyzed. Aside from only one patient in whom a correct diagnosis was reached, and despite numerous examinations indicated by suspicious, diagnoses were imprecise, with two or three alternatives. Although not performed systematically, the preoperative mycologic sputum studies and serologic tests were negative. Nevertheless, in four cases, fungal etiology of the tumor was suspected, three of them with single bronchiectasis and blocked bronchus. Examination of operative specimens led to the isolation of a little known form of pulmonary aspergillosis, which in the second part of this study (6) was named tumor-like blocked cystic space with liquid contents infected with aspergilli (TBLA).",1978,756761,no
alpha-Mannosidases of genera Aspergillus and Rhizopus. Activity and capacity to utilize Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan of the best alpha-mannosidase producer Aspergillus flavus Link 69.,"Strains of fungi imperfecti of genera Aspergillus and Rhizopus were tested for the ability to produce alpha-mannosidases. The most suitable alpha-mannosidase producer of a total of 20 strains under study was Aspergillus Ravus Link 69. The parameters studied during the cultivation included the growth rate expressed as cell dry weight, alpha-mannosidase activity of the extracellular medium with p-nitorphenyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside as substrate, and utilization of Saccharomyces cerebisiae mannan via its disappearance from the cultivation medium.",1978,100400,no

"[Correlations between culture methods, double diffusion and immunofluorescence in the laboratory diagnosis of mycoses (candidiasis and aspergillosis)].","Of a total of 1950 patients with various pneumologic affections 115 cases were selected, on the basis of positive mycologic results on examination of the bronchial aspirate. In these patients immunodiffusion and immunofluorescence serological tests were carried out. Confrontation with the clinical and histopathologic diagnosis showed that the simultaneous use of mycological studies (of the bronchial aspirate) and of complex serologic investigations (immunodiffusion, immunofluorescence) allow to make a correcs and aspergilloses.",1977,201010,no
Chemical structure of the galactomannan from the cell wall of Aspergillus niger.,"The galactomannan of surface grown Aspergillus niger has been isolated by alkaline extraction of hyphal walls and characterized structurally. Its elution profile, from a column of Bio-Gel P-150, reveals a broad range of molecular sizes grouped into two fractions. Gas chromatographic and colorimetric analyses indicate that each fraction is composed of approximately equimolar quantities of galactose and mannose plus 12 to 14% glucose. Both have similar low optical rotations and contain acid labile galactose. Methylation, Smith degradation, acetolysis, reactivity with concanavalin A and beta-D-galactofuranosidase, plus digestionof galactose with D-galactose oxidase, were techniques employed to determine the polysaccharide's covalent structure. Results of these studies indicate that it is composed of a series of chains, 5 to 9 hexose units in length, connected by alpha1 leads to 6 bonds between mannopyranosyl moieties. The external portion of each chain consists of a galactose tri- or tetrasaccharide of the general structure Galf beta1 leads to 4 Galp(1-2) 1 leads to 4 Galp1 leads to. This segment is connected via a (1 leads to 2) linkage to the internal portion which is a di- to pentasaccharide of mannopyranosyl units joined in alpha1 leads to 2 glycoside linkage. Combination mild acid hydrolysis and methylation experiments indicate galactofuranosyl terminal units are attached only to galactose. The organization of glucose into the overall structure of the polymer has not been determined. Structural relationships of this polysaccharide to both fungal and yeast galactomannans are discussed.",1977,856795,no
The uptake of Aspergillus fumigatus protein by serum IgG antibody from patients with pulmonary aspergillosis.,"A method is presented for measuring the uptake of Aspergillus fumigatus protein by IgG antibodies from human serum. The human IgG is first isolated with an anti-IgG conjugated immunosorbent and then incubated with radio-iodinated A. fumigatus protein. A group of twenty-three control sera gave the same background levels as tests without sera. The highest uptake of A. fumigatus protein was given by the sera of patients with aspergilloma, and lower values were obtained with six out of thirteen sera from patient's with asthma and twenty-five out of twenty-eight sera from patients with asthma and pulmonary eosinophilia, i.e. allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. These results were in agreement with precipitin tests, Inhibition studies with unrelated antigens showed that the reactions were specific for the A. fumigatus protein, of which more was bound by test sera than with a crude extract.",1977,326434,no
Counterimmunoelectrophoresis and opportunistic fungal infections.,"Sera from 35 apparently normal humans, 37 compromised human patients, 30 hedgehogs and 30 sheep, were examined for precipitating antibodies to four opportunistic fungi - Absidia corymbifera, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans and Rhizopus arrhizus-using counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE). Precipitins to A. fumigatus were almost exclusively confined to specimens obtained from the compromised human group (51% of those examined) while Candida precipitating antibodies were detected in the sera of both normal (26%) and compromised (49%) humans and in 10% of the hedgehog specimens. Serum precipitins against the two phycomycetes included in the investigations were rare. Because of the complexity of most fungal antigen extracts, it appears the two phycomycetes included in the investigations were rare. Beause of the complexity of most fungal antigen extracts, it appears essential that sera be tested against a number of different antigen concentrations if CIE is to be used with confidence in fungal serology.",1977,321971,no
Radioallergosorbent test (RAST) studies with insolubilized polysaccharides.,"Polysaccharide preparations from Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans when used with some human sera were found to fix complement and precipitate with specific antibodies present in the sera. Precipitins consisted predominantly of IgG with traces of IgM and IgA. Following insolubilization of the fungal polysaccharide preparations with the N-carboxyanhydride of L-leucine, reactivity with serum precipitins was retained and reaction with IgE antibodies was demonstrated using the radioallergosorbent test (RAST). Results showed that for A. fumigatus and C. albicans at least, polysaccharide-specific IgE antibodies probably occur in sera from some hypersensitive individuals. We suggest that chemical methods of the type described which induce polymerization or cross-linking will be useful for detecting IgE antibodies in the RAST. Such an approach could be used with a variety of polysaccharide preparations which cannot be coupled to polysaccharide solid supports by the usual methods.",1976,795563,no
RAST using crude and purified anti-IgE.,"The sensitivity of the RAST using anti-IgE in 125I-labelled IgG fractions of sheep antiserum was compared to that using anti-IgE purified by immunosorbent techniques in tests with three allergens (grass pollens, Aspergillus fumigatus and the detergent enzyme ""Alcalase"") on sera from 248 workers in a detergent factory. Both anti-IgE reagents measure the same antibody but the RAST procedure using the crude anti-IgE reagent is less sensitive than that using the immunosorbent-purified anti-IgE in its ability to detect circulating IgE in subjects with positive skin-prick tests. In general the agreement between positive RAST and positive skin test was improved when only skin tests equal to or greater than 3 mm were considered positive. With Alcalase, antigen non-specific binding by the crude anti-IgE reagent may give false positive results. Optimal conditions for the preparation of allergosorbents with this allergen are defined. Predictive equations relating the results of RAST and skin test show that the hitherto arbitrary definition of a positive RAST result is statistically valid.",1976,788951,no
[The evidence of precipitins in Aspergillus caused disorders of the lung as a diagnostic method (author's transl)].,"A report is given about serologic results of 27 aspergilloses, mostly aspergillomas. The evidence of antibodies directed against aspergillus species was carried out by radial diffusion according to OUCHTERLONY and immunoelectrophoretically. Filtrate antigens (""metabolic antigens"") were used troughout. The positive yield lies in about 90%. Regarding the criteria for evaluation no positive reactions were seen in a control group of 140 patients with serious tuberculosis and other lung disorders. The method is emphasized  as diagnostic mean for clearing up shadows of the lung and for pathogenetic control of aspergillus--grown from lung materials.",1976,828358,no
Precipitating antibodies in a midwest dairy farming population toward the antigens associated with farmer's lung disease.,"A survey of the frequency of precipitins to the antigens of the thermophilic actinomycetes and Aspergillus species was conducted on serum samples from 1,045 farmers obtained at a 3-day exposition on modern farm equipment and farming practices in central Wisconsin. Each farmer filled out a questionnaire including socioeconomic information, lung disease history, exposure history, and smoking history. Precipitins were detected by the double-diffusion method. The antigen panel included eight thermophilic actinomycetes species and a mixture of Aspergillus species. Precipitins were found in the sera of 93 famers (8.9%). The distribution of positive precipitins was: Micropolyspora faeni 63 (67.7%), Thermoactinomyces vulgaris 7 (7.5%), Thermomonospora viridis 2 (2.2%), M. faeni + T. viridis 16 (17.2%), M. faeni + T. vulgaris 1 (1.1%), Aspergillus species 4 (4.3%). Of all the parameters tested for in the questionnaire, those with positive serology differed significantly from the whole population only in that a higher proportion of the positives reported exposure to silo gas and illness after uncapping silos. Comparison of the size of the farm and the number of dairy cows in the state of Wisconsin with the population samples indicated that the sample population was skewed toward those with larger farms and larger dairy herds. This study confirms that a significant proportion of the farm population in Wisconsin does have precipitins to the microorganisms associated with farmer's lung disease. Follow-up studies to establish the relationship between the positive precipitin reactions to the presence of clinical disease are now under way.",1976,932340,no
Aspergillus oryzae meningitis.,"In a patient with only meningitis, a septate hypha was seen in a Langhans giant cell, and the rarely pathogenic Aspergillus oryzae was cultured from the cerebrospinal fluid.

An aspergillus immunodiffusion test in the early diagnosis of aspergillosis in adult leukemia patients.,"An Aspergillus fumigatus immunodiffusion test was performed biweekly for one year on 80 hospitalized patients with acute leukemia to determine if serologic conversion accompanied clinical aspergillosis. A micro-ouchterlony technique with agarose was used. The antigens were prepared from concentrated A. fumigatus culture filtrates and the sera were concentrated 3-fold before testing. Of 80 patients, 10 were proved at autopsy, lung biopsy, or closed space culture to have invasive aspergillosis. Six of 10 patients converted from a negative to a positive immunodiffusion test, whereas a seventh patient's weakly positive test became strongly positive. Three patients with documented aspergillosis did not develop a positive immunodiffusion test. Four of the patients who converted from a negative to a positive test were treated early and successfully with amphotericin B. A fifth patient developed immunodiffusion test antibody late in the course and died despite therapy. A sixth patient died of concomitant mucormycosis despite early therapy. Six additional patients who converted from a negative to a positive immunodiffusion test could not be evaluated because of inadequate documentation of aspergillosis. In severely immunosuppressed patients, our immunodiffusion test proved to be a specific but not always a sensitive test for aspergillosis. In 4 patients, biweekly tests showed conversion associated with invasive aspergillosis, which was diagnosed early and treated successfully.",1976,816237,no
Skin reaction and macrophage migration inhibition tests for polysaccharides from Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans.,"Guinea pigs sensitized with purified galactomannan from Aspergillus fumigatus and mannan from Candida albicans, each containing negligible quantities of nitrogen, were examined for their immunological responses against the corresponding polysaccharides with respect to the delayed-type skin reaction and the macrophage migration inhibition phenomenon. In both cases, the delayed-type skin reaction test and the macrophage migration inhibition test showed positive results. The reactivity was stronger in animals sensitized with polysaccharides in Freund's complete adjuvant than those sensitized with the same polysaccharides in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Polysaccharides chemically modified by partial acid degradation or by periodate oxidation were found to be completely incapable of eliciting such immune responses. These results are also discussed in relation to the antigenic determinant of the polysaccharides in such immune responses and the precipitin reaction previously observed by us and other investigators.",1975,772255,no
Fungal infection following renal transplantation.,"Twenty-seven deep fungal infections developed in 22 of 171 patients following renal transplantation. These infections included cryptococcosis (ten), nocardiosis (seven), candidiasis (four), aspergillosis (two), phycomycosis (two), chromomycosis (one), and subcutaneous infection with Phialophora gougeroti (one). Twelve infections occurred in living-related and ten in cadaveric recipients. Nineteen of the 22 patients were male. Infections occurred from 0 to 61 months after transplantation. Complicating non-fungal infections were present concomitantly in 15 patients. Thirteen patients died, eight probably as a result of fungal infection. Appropriate diagnostic procedures yielded a diagnosis in 20 of 27 infections, and therapy was begun in 18 patients. Serologic, culture, and biopsy procedures useful in making rapid diagnoses are advocated in the hope of increasing survival.",1975,1100007,no
"RAST studies : IgE antibodies to Dermatogoides pteronyssinus (house dust mite), Aspergillus fumigatus and beta-lactoglobulin in sudden death in infancy syndrome (SDIS).","The incidence of 2.5 SDIS cases per 1,000 live births found in Western Australia is in agreement with figures reported for other centres. While the age range of SDIS victims extended from two weeks to 15 months, 57 per cent of deaths occurred in children of two to four months of age. Boys outnumbered girls 1.6:1. Environmental factors are implicated in that the majority of deaths occurred in a biphasic distribution - autumn and late winter months. No significant differences were observed in total IgE levels in serum from SDIS victims, post mortem children who died in trauma of known aetiology and live control children of the same age range. Serum IgE antibodies to D.pteronyssinus were found in 37% of SDIS victims compared with 7% of matched controls (post mortem plus live groups). IgE antibodies to beta-lactoglobulin, the major allergen of cow's milk, appeared with twice the frequency in SDIS vs. control group but both groups showed a similar incidence of antibodies to the allergens of Aspergillus fumigatus. The prevalence of IgE antibodies to D.pteronyssinus in SDIS victims who died in the late winter -- early spring period was double that found in the group who died in the autumn period. Sixtyfour percent of the SDIS victims had antibodies to two or more of the three allergens tested while the control sera were positive to only one allergen. These results support the hypothesis that anaphylaxis induced by immediate hypersensitivity to D.pteronyssinus in particular may be one of the causative factors in SDIS in Western Australia.",1975,1097279,no
Late asthmatic reactions to inhalation of fractions from extracts of Candida albicans and Asperguillus fumigatus.,"To investigate the mechanism of late respiratory reactions after exposure to extracts of C.albicans and A.fumigatus, patients with asthma were studied with skin tests, inhalation tests and serologic tests including precipitin tests, using purified polysaccharide fraction (PS) and protein fraction (P). Thirty five inhalation tests in 30 patients separated reactors with late onset into two groups, 7 patients with precipitins, intermediate dermal and respiratory reactions, and 10 patients with delayed skin reaction and delayed dyspnea. Exposure to PS could elicit immediate and intermediate respiratory reactions but not delayed reactions, which had been observed after exposure to Prut or crude extract, suggesting that the delayed respiratory reactions observed were immunologically different from those caused by Arthustype allergy. Skin test with PS elicited immediate, intermediate, or both reactions, and those with P evoked immediate, intermediate, or delayed reactions or some combinations of these. The same relationship of purified fractions to patterns of skin reactions as well as respiratory reactions existed in guinea pigs immunized with C.albicans. Taking the results to animal experiments into consideration it would appear that some of the late responses after exposure to Prot or crude extract of C.albicans and A.fumigatus were due to allergic mechanism of the delayed type.",1974,4283487,no
Use of the immunodiffusion test in the serodiagnosis of aspergillosis.,"The diagnostic value of an immunodiffusion (ID) test with standardized precipitinogens derived from five Aspergillus species was determined with sera from 60 proven and 12 suspected cases of aspergillosis. The data demonstrated that the greatest number of aspergillosis cases were detected by the concurrent use of A. fumigatus and A. niger precipitinogens. With these precipitinogens, the ID test permitted the serodiagnosis of aspergillosis in 82% of the 60 proven cases and in 83% of the 12 suspected cases. The presence of one or more precipitins was indicative of aspergilloma, of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, or of invasive aspergillosis. Precipitins were detected in 93% of the sera from patients with aspergilloma, in 50% of the sera from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and in 88% of the sera from patients with invasive aspergillosis. Although the presence of one or two precipitin bands could indicate any form of aspergillosis, the presence of three or four was strong evidence of either aspergilloma or invasive aspergillosis. The ID test was found to be 100% specific in an evaluation of its effectiveness with 65 sera from individuals with other systemic mycotic infections, bacterial or neoplastic diseases, and from apparently normal humans. In diagnosed cases of aspergillosis, the examination of serial serum specimens provided information about the clinical course of the disease. A reduction in the number of precipitin bands and significant titer changes were noted as the patients responded to therapy.",1972,4622826,no
Pulmonary mycotic infections allergic and immunologic factors.,"The mechanisms of immunity and allergy, at play in every infectious disease, must be comprehended before the pathogenesis of an infection can be appreciated.Immunity, allergy and serology are concerned with specific antigen-antibody reactions. In immunity the principal concern is with the final disposition of antigen (agglutination, lysis, and phagocytosis). In allergy attention is focused upon tissue damage resulting from antigen-antibody union. In serology interest is devoted to the presence of antibody as evaluated by certain visible in vitro reactions-precipitin, agglutination, opsonization and complement fixation tests. There are two types of allergic reaction-the immediate or anaphylactic type and the delayed type or the allergic disease of infection. Neither kind takes part in the mechanism of immunity. At this time the allergic antibody and the immune antibody must be considered as two different and distinct antibodies. Skin and serologic tests are important diagnostic aids in certain pulmonary mycotic infections-for example, coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, histoplasmosis and moniliasis. Clinical expressions of allergy may appear in coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis and moniliasis. Pulmonary mycoses are divided into three groups, that is, the endogenous mycoses (actinomycosis, moniliasis, geotrichosis), the endogenous-exogenous mycoses (cryptococcosis, aspergillosis, mucormycosis) and the exogenous mycoses (nocardiosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, North American blastomycosis). The diagnosis and treatment of the important mycotic infections that invade lung tissue are discussed.",1954,13209369,no
